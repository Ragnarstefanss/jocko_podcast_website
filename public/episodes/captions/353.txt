[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 353 with Echo Charles and me,
[00:00:04] Jocko willing.
[00:00:05] Good evening Echo.
[00:00:05] Good evening.
[00:00:07] My brave fellows,
[00:00:11] you have done all I asked you to do
[00:00:13] and more than can be reasonably expected,
[00:00:17] but your country is at stake.
[00:00:19] Your wives, your houses, and all that you hold dear.
[00:00:24] You have worn, worn yourselves out with fatigues
[00:00:28] and hardships,
[00:00:31] but we know not how to spare you.
[00:00:35] If you will consent to stay one month longer,
[00:00:38] you will render that service to the cause of liberty
[00:00:40] and to your country,
[00:00:42] which you probably can never do
[00:00:44] under any other circumstances.
[00:00:50] And that right there was a quote from George Washington,
[00:00:55] encouraging his men to re-enlist in the army.
[00:01:00] And he made that speech on Tuesday, December 31st, 1776.
[00:01:05] This was less than a week after the successful attack
[00:01:10] at Trenton and great victory for Washington's army,
[00:01:14] the one that everybody knows about,
[00:01:15] crossing the Delaware River
[00:01:18] and able to achieve this victory.
[00:01:21] But the men had suffered greatly.
[00:01:24] Prior to that, they had lost the battle
[00:01:26] of White Plains in October,
[00:01:28] the battle at Fort Washington in November,
[00:01:31] their uniforms, when you read about
[00:01:33] what condition they were in,
[00:01:35] they were just in tatters and rags at this point.
[00:01:37] Some of them didn't have shoes,
[00:01:40] by the way, December in the Northeast.
[00:01:44] So this was the last day of the year, December 31st.
[00:01:48] And interestingly, most of the soldiers enlistments,
[00:01:53] they'd enlisted for a year or two years.
[00:01:54] And so a lot of the soldiers, their enlistments were up
[00:01:58] at the end of the year.
[00:02:00] And this was a potential disaster for the army.
[00:02:05] But through this personal appeal,
[00:02:07] Washington convinced about half the men to stay and carry on.
[00:02:12] And they were able to defeat the British at Princeton
[00:02:17] and kind of revived the morale of the Continental Army.
[00:02:23] But that just put that question into my mind
[00:02:27] is when is enough enough?
[00:02:29] And we call on our servicemen and women to do so much.
[00:02:35] And it's amazing when they decide to continue to serve.
[00:02:40] And it's an honor here to have one of those men
[00:02:43] with us tonight, retired seal,
[00:02:46] 26 years of service, husband, father, teammate,
[00:02:49] friend of mine who deployed to Iraq,
[00:02:52] deployed to Afghanistan, Africa, Asia, Europe,
[00:02:57] South America, Central America.
[00:02:59] And he's looking to continue his service now.
[00:03:03] His name is Derek Van Orden.
[00:03:05] We used to call him Van Oh.
[00:03:06] That's right.
[00:03:08] Van Oh?
[00:03:09] Van Oh.
[00:03:10] Derek?
[00:03:11] Yeah.
[00:03:11] Thanks for coming down, man.
[00:03:12] Thank you for having me.
[00:03:13] Good to see you.
[00:03:14] It's good to see you too.
[00:03:15] DVO.
[00:03:16] I don't know why.
[00:03:17] I mean, I do.
[00:03:18] Oh, because you gotta have the three letters.
[00:03:21] You know what?
[00:03:22] That's a little too close to deviant.
[00:03:24] I don't know if I like that.
[00:03:26] Well, yeah.
[00:03:27] Speaking of that, man.
[00:03:29] So I've never been to your place here.
[00:03:30] It's marvelous.
[00:03:32] And went to the head.
[00:03:34] That's the bathroom for folks who aren't in the Navy.
[00:03:37] And like 30 guys, I was talking to Echo about this.
[00:03:41] They're all looking at me like, what are you doing?
[00:03:43] I look like, you know, the hillbilly came rolling in.
[00:03:47] But it's a wonderful facility here, man.
[00:03:49] Yeah.
[00:03:50] Well, it's a mixed martial arts.
[00:03:51] So I guess your point is a mixed martial arts gym.
[00:03:53] It's literally the middle of our professional pro MMA
[00:03:58] practice is going on out in the gym.
[00:04:00] So it's the Alliance team, which trains here out of victory.
[00:04:05] With some incredible fighters, some champs in there.
[00:04:08] Dominic Cruz just saw Dom.
[00:04:09] And so, yes, they're athletes in peak physique in the prime
[00:04:14] of their athletic careers.
[00:04:16] Well, I'm certainly in my prime.
[00:04:17] You are like Doc Holiday.
[00:04:20] You are in your prime just like Doc Holiday,
[00:04:22] apparently at this point.
[00:04:24] No, awesome to see you, man.
[00:04:25] So let's start at the beginning.
[00:04:27] Let's start where you came from.
[00:04:29] Let's figure out how you got here today.
[00:04:31] And let's talk about that story.
[00:04:33] So when and where were you born?
[00:04:35] Well, to begin in the beginning, as they say,
[00:04:38] I was raised in abject rural poverty by a single mom.
[00:04:43] My dad was not honorable.
[00:04:44] No other way to describe that.
[00:04:45] He abandoned us when I was an infant.
[00:04:47] And I dropped out of high school when I was 16 years old.
[00:04:50] Hold on a second.
[00:04:51] You got really quick through a lot of years.
[00:04:52] Oh.
[00:04:53] So I was.
[00:04:54] So you were born.
[00:04:55] So where is this?
[00:04:56] I was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[00:04:58] My father abandoned us.
[00:04:59] We had to move in with my grandmother in Laverne, Minnesota.
[00:05:02] What's Laverne, Minnesota?
[00:05:04] For some reason, I haven't heard of this metropolitan city.
[00:05:06] Well, you should have because Ken Burns did one of his
[00:05:10] documentaries called The War.
[00:05:11] OK.
[00:05:12] It featured the Palace Theater, which
[00:05:14] is on Main Street in Laverne.
[00:05:15] And we lived in the apartment above the Palace Theater
[00:05:18] once we got enough together because we
[00:05:19] had to live with my grandmother when we were that poor.
[00:05:21] So what's the population of Laverne?
[00:05:24] Gosh, I don't know now.
[00:05:25] But it's a small town.
[00:05:26] It's a small town.
[00:05:27] What was your mom doing to make ends meet?
[00:05:30] She was one of the first female sports
[00:05:34] reporters in the country.
[00:05:36] And she's always been a stats head.
[00:05:38] And she died nine years ago, eight years ago now.
[00:05:40] My mom, she's wonderful.
[00:05:41] Carol Ann Mulligan.
[00:05:42] She's like this tall, five foot nothing,
[00:05:46] and hard as woodpecker lips.
[00:05:48] She's a tough man.
[00:05:49] And then she got a job with a company called INA, which became
[00:05:55] Cigna Insurance.
[00:05:56] And that's how we wound up in Wisconsin.
[00:05:58] So I grew up in Wisconsin, southeastern Wisconsin,
[00:06:01] because my mother got promoted.
[00:06:03] Wait, so when did she leave sports reported?
[00:06:05] Oh my gosh, that would have been.
[00:06:07] That was prior to the insurance thing?
[00:06:08] I don't need the years.
[00:06:09] But so she was doing that sort of thing.
[00:06:11] Right, it was kind of on and off that sort of stuff.
[00:06:13] Right, because it was just weird to have a woman reporting
[00:06:15] sports.
[00:06:16] Now it's common.
[00:06:17] Yeah, it's normative.
[00:06:19] So she couldn't quite pull off a career in sports reporting?
[00:06:23] No, that wouldn't happen.
[00:06:24] But then she went to the insurance business?
[00:06:26] Right, she started as a secretary.
[00:06:28] And then she got promoted.
[00:06:30] She was very bright.
[00:06:32] And she wound up retiring, running the West Coast for Cigna.
[00:06:38] She ran this whole office.
[00:06:39] And it was interesting.
[00:06:40] She's sitting around hearing the story.
[00:06:43] It's fascinating, because it helped me later on in my career
[00:06:46] as a seal, that she was like, wait a minute.
[00:06:49] If we have this phone, and anyone has a phone,
[00:06:51] they can call this number.
[00:06:53] And if they have the ability to understand
[00:06:55] what's going on with this phone, they
[00:06:57] can get everybody's insurance information.
[00:06:59] So she was one of the first people to get into cybersecurity,
[00:07:04] because you had the modem.
[00:07:05] You know what I mean?
[00:07:05] It didn't matter.
[00:07:06] There was no encryption there.
[00:07:07] It was if you could have a modem, you know, that sort of stuff.
[00:07:11] So she started doing that.
[00:07:13] You guys are that.
[00:07:14] You don't know how old are you?
[00:07:15] 44.
[00:07:16] All right, you remember.
[00:07:17] You're old.
[00:07:18] You remember dial-up?
[00:07:19] Yeah.
[00:07:20] Look at that.
[00:07:21] Down for the dial-up.
[00:07:22] 100% AOL.
[00:07:23] You got mail, son.
[00:07:24] Yeah, you do.
[00:07:25] So she did that.
[00:07:27] And not having a father figure as a dad, my uncle Bob,
[00:07:34] which is her oldest brother, she's one of 10 Irish Catholics.
[00:07:37] And Bob left Worthington, which is outside of Laverne,
[00:07:43] when he was 16 years old, and joined the Navy in World War II.
[00:07:46] There's this great picture of him.
[00:07:47] He's sitting like this with his hands over the rail
[00:07:50] of an ammunition oiler right off at Iwo Jima.
[00:07:53] No shirt on.
[00:07:54] You know, just hanging, being a sailor.
[00:07:56] And it's just so fun, you know.
[00:07:58] But yeah, so Gunny went to, he's in the Navy,
[00:08:02] and then they demobilized everybody after World War II.
[00:08:06] So he goes back to Minnesota, can't find a job.
[00:08:10] And he's like, man, I need a job.
[00:08:11] This is Uncle Bob we're talking about.
[00:08:13] This is Robert Francis Mulligan.
[00:08:14] The oldest brother of your mom.
[00:08:19] Of my mom.
[00:08:19] Got it.
[00:08:20] So he was one of 10.
[00:08:22] And so he wants to go back to Minnesota.
[00:08:24] This is so fun, because we're in San Diego.
[00:08:26] And he goes to the Marine Corps.
[00:08:29] And he's like, can I join the Marines?
[00:08:31] He goes, yeah, there's some staff sergeant there.
[00:08:33] He goes, OK, here's your bus ticket to San Diego.
[00:08:36] And you'll go to the bus station, take your cab to MCRD,
[00:08:39] which is right down the road from here.
[00:08:41] And then you're there.
[00:08:43] And Bob's looking at his feet.
[00:08:45] It's museum feet.
[00:08:46] You don't want to be in a museum anymore.
[00:08:47] You can't shelf for your feet.
[00:08:48] And the staff sergeant looks at him.
[00:08:51] He goes, you don't have enough money for a cab, do you?
[00:08:53] And he's like, nope.
[00:08:53] So he gives him money for a cab.
[00:08:56] So Bob takes the bus, cab, MCRD, Marine Corps, fast forward,
[00:09:01] 20 years or whatever it is.
[00:09:03] He sees this warren officer.
[00:09:04] And in that Marine Corps, they're called gunners.
[00:09:06] And he's like, hey, man, I think I know you.
[00:09:09] And he goes, were you a recruiter in Minnesota?
[00:09:11] He goes, I'm the guy that you gave the money for the cab.
[00:09:16] And the gunner looks at him and goes,
[00:09:17] do you know how many people have to give money for a cab?
[00:09:21] So we think that things are difficult now.
[00:09:23] And we're getting, trust me, man, the economy's going
[00:09:26] right in the tank.
[00:09:26] It's bad.
[00:09:27] But the level of affluence that we have in the United States
[00:09:31] of America now is unprecedented in the history of the world.
[00:09:34] And that goes across all spectrums.
[00:09:37] I mean, that was like, you didn't have anything.
[00:09:39] So Bob does 20 years.
[00:09:42] He goes to Korea, grievously injured
[00:09:46] by Chinese communist soldiers throwing a China
[00:09:48] com grenade into his Foxhole, and then he winds up going to Laos
[00:09:55] in 1962.
[00:09:57] Retired becomes a police officer in a small village
[00:09:59] in Wisconsin called Shinigwa and retired as the chief police,
[00:10:02] the fire chief, and the village administrator.
[00:10:05] And he ends up being, you say, your father figure.
[00:10:08] Correct.
[00:10:09] What do you have for brothers and sisters?
[00:10:11] I have one brother.
[00:10:13] Older, younger?
[00:10:14] Older.
[00:10:14] OK.
[00:10:16] Now, what?
[00:10:17] You're now going to school.
[00:10:18] You used to live in above this theater in Laverne?
[00:10:21] Right, till I was in second grade.
[00:10:23] OK.
[00:10:24] And then we moved.
[00:10:24] Mom got promoted.
[00:10:25] Then we moved to Heartland, Wisconsin.
[00:10:28] Heartland?
[00:10:29] Heartland.
[00:10:30] Just straight up.
[00:10:31] Heartland, Wisconsin.
[00:10:32] Yeah, man.
[00:10:34] So we grew up there.
[00:10:35] We were still very poor.
[00:10:36] The apartments we live in now, I think, are Section 8 housing.
[00:10:41] That we lived in then are now, I believe, Section 8 housing.
[00:10:45] And now this is where you go to middle school.
[00:10:48] Is this where you go to high school and stuff?
[00:10:50] No.
[00:10:51] So mom got promoted again.
[00:10:54] And then we moved to Oregon.
[00:10:56] Oh, OK.
[00:10:57] And that's where I was in high school for a year and two weeks
[00:11:00] of my sophomore year.
[00:11:02] Were you playing sports growing up?
[00:11:04] I wrestled for my freshman year.
[00:11:07] But I never was into those types of things.
[00:11:10] I just I never was.
[00:11:13] My brother's super big in professional sports.
[00:11:15] Clearly, my mother was because she was a sports reporter.
[00:11:18] But just never did much for me.
[00:11:21] I don't want to.
[00:11:22] What were you focused on?
[00:11:23] Were you focused on academics?
[00:11:25] No, you know what?
[00:11:27] I wasn't.
[00:11:28] I mean, I read.
[00:11:29] I've always been a huge reader.
[00:11:31] From when I was a little kid, I was always reading.
[00:11:34] And I was kind of more, I don't know how to put that.
[00:11:38] I just I was into exploring the world from a different
[00:11:43] perspective because so we were so poor.
[00:11:46] I mean, like dirt poor.
[00:11:48] And I knew I could never collect material objects
[00:11:52] because of that.
[00:11:53] And so from when I was just a little kid,
[00:11:56] I started collecting relationships with people.
[00:11:58] And I had the same friends that I've had since I was 14
[00:12:01] because I understand the value of human beings.
[00:12:04] And I understand the value of the intrinsic nature
[00:12:06] if somebody's intellect vise their physical being.
[00:12:10] And they're clearly intertwined.
[00:12:13] One is part of another.
[00:12:15] But so for me, that's always been my thing.
[00:12:17] So I've always really focused on humans.
[00:12:22] And the additive value of people, the synergistic effect
[00:12:28] of getting together, that's how you create.
[00:12:31] And so I've always done that.
[00:12:33] I've done some art stuff and whatever.
[00:12:36] What's art stuff or whatever?
[00:12:38] Well, sketch, I write poetry and believe it or not.
[00:12:42] So when you're in school, are you like hanging out
[00:12:46] with the freaking poetry club?
[00:12:50] Is that what we got going on?
[00:12:51] No, I was.
[00:12:52] Wait, were you wearing all black?
[00:12:53] And like, oh my gosh.
[00:12:55] Dying in your black?
[00:12:56] Who's wearing all black here?
[00:12:59] You guys, is this camera working?
[00:13:01] So no, man.
[00:13:03] I was kind of an outsider because, again, children
[00:13:07] can be very cruel.
[00:13:09] And when I say we're poor, I mean, we were poor.
[00:13:11] So I was ostracized because of my poverty.
[00:13:16] And then when we moved to Oregon,
[00:13:17] it was a very affluent community.
[00:13:18] And I wasn't just on the other side of the tracks,
[00:13:21] I was on the other side of it.
[00:13:24] So that can be very, you can take that one or two directions.
[00:13:29] You can consciously choose your path.
[00:13:32] And you can choose to ride that into the dirt
[00:13:35] and get into this destructive cycle.
[00:13:40] And we've seen this happen over and over again,
[00:13:42] intergenerational poverty and all these things.
[00:13:43] And people feel like they have no way out.
[00:13:46] I mean, I was the, did you ever see someone walk around
[00:13:49] with their head down?
[00:13:50] Yeah.
[00:13:51] And they walk like that all the time.
[00:13:52] Somebody, I ran into them.
[00:13:54] Where did I see them?
[00:13:56] They're like, oh, so I had dropped out of high school.
[00:13:59] I was working.
[00:14:01] I've been supporting myself since I was 16.
[00:14:02] And someone's like, oh, I remember you from high school.
[00:14:05] You're the guy that always walked with your head down.
[00:14:08] And I was like, wait a minute, you're right.
[00:14:10] So I started walking with my head up.
[00:14:12] And just that simple.
[00:14:14] Wait, when was that?
[00:14:15] I would have been 17 or 18.
[00:14:17] So when you're 17 or 18, someone said, oh, you used to walk
[00:14:20] around with your head down.
[00:14:21] You're the guy.
[00:14:22] They recognized me.
[00:14:23] You're the guy that would walk around with your head down.
[00:14:25] I wasn't self-absorbed, but it was like I felt like,
[00:14:28] because we were so pouring being just the other.
[00:14:32] That I shouldn't be interacting with the world around me.
[00:14:35] So I put my head up.
[00:14:37] And I was like that one physical gesture of going,
[00:14:41] I am here.
[00:14:42] And I'm part of the equation.
[00:14:44] And then that slowly opens up your aperture.
[00:14:47] And you start looking around.
[00:14:48] And you're like, oh, what's going on here?
[00:14:49] Can I do something here?
[00:14:50] Can I do something there?
[00:14:52] The visual feedback that you get from another person
[00:14:55] actually enhances your ability to have a relationship with
[00:14:57] them, which I think is very important.
[00:14:59] That posture thing is huge. I had JP DeNel on this podcast.
[00:15:03] I work with him still.
[00:15:04] But I talked about, and this was a long time ago,
[00:15:08] I talked about the fact I was watching him.
[00:15:09] Like I'm sitting in a door well or something
[00:15:12] on a street in Ramadi.
[00:15:13] And I'm watching JP maneuver.
[00:15:16] And he's walking with his chest out, his head up.
[00:15:20] Like I'm here.
[00:15:21] Just like I'm here.
[00:15:22] I'm going to get it.
[00:15:23] And a lot of people, your instinct is to, especially
[00:15:26] in combat, is to get small.
[00:15:29] And he's like, no, chest up, head out.
[00:15:32] And that became a thing.
[00:15:33] This whole posture thing.
[00:15:34] I mean, Jordan Peterson talked about stand up straight with
[00:15:37] your shoulders back.
[00:15:38] I was like, oh, yeah, that was JP DeNel.
[00:15:39] And it sounds like you made that transition at 17 years old
[00:15:43] when someone said, dude, you're walking around
[00:15:44] with your head down.
[00:15:45] Yeah, that makes a difference.
[00:15:47] Yeah, it does.
[00:15:47] And I think that I don't think I know that people now, they
[00:15:52] can go, oh, this is a brash person.
[00:15:57] But when I sit down with them, talk to them, they understand
[00:16:00] that that's not posturing.
[00:16:02] It's posture.
[00:16:03] So then there's a difference between the two.
[00:16:05] One is something that's internalized, and the other
[00:16:08] one is a projection.
[00:16:10] So if you have posture that you've internalized that,
[00:16:14] you're posturing, you're pretending.
[00:16:15] I don't pretend about really anything.
[00:16:19] So you're going to high school.
[00:16:21] You're ostracized.
[00:16:24] And at some point, you say you decide to drop out of high
[00:16:26] school.
[00:16:27] The institution no longer had anything to offer me.
[00:16:30] That is a direct quote from Anna Walsh, I think.
[00:16:33] It's a direct quote from what?
[00:16:34] Animal house, I believe.
[00:16:35] OK.
[00:16:36] So you decide, what did your mom say about this?
[00:16:39] She was not happy.
[00:16:40] Yeah, I was going to say, there's no mom that's like, oh,
[00:16:42] cool, you're dropping out of high school.
[00:16:43] No, she was not happy at all.
[00:16:45] What was your plan?
[00:16:46] I didn't have one.
[00:16:48] Just on that phone at school anymore?
[00:16:49] I'm out.
[00:16:50] Had you already been working?
[00:16:52] Yeah, I started working, I think, when I was 14.
[00:16:55] And so what are you doing?
[00:16:57] I worked at a movie theater.
[00:16:58] Cool.
[00:16:58] And then I worked at a gas station.
[00:17:00] Roger?
[00:17:01] Yep, Chevron gas station.
[00:17:03] Pound the gas, fixin' cars.
[00:17:04] And now you must, what's your reasoning behind dropping out
[00:17:08] of school?
[00:17:09] How you coming to this conclusion as a 16-year-old?
[00:17:11] It was, I don't think the environment was oppressive.
[00:17:14] I just didn't fit.
[00:17:17] And I just didn't want to be part of that.
[00:17:20] So you tell your mom, what was it in the school year?
[00:17:23] Was it in the summertime?
[00:17:24] It was two weeks into my sophomore year.
[00:17:28] I'm out.
[00:17:29] Yeah, I did.
[00:17:30] I'm out.
[00:17:31] And then I moved out.
[00:17:33] So what'd you get for a job?
[00:17:34] I was working at the gas station.
[00:17:36] Oh, OK.
[00:17:36] So the gas station job, you move into what?
[00:17:38] An apartment or something?
[00:17:40] Yeah.
[00:17:42] That was it.
[00:17:42] I mean, so do I recommend this life path?
[00:17:49] I did that.
[00:17:49] I got an undergraduate degree at 44.
[00:17:51] I got accepted to law school at 50,
[00:17:52] and all that sort of stuff.
[00:17:53] Would I recommend this path?
[00:17:57] That's a very complicated answer, because in some ways,
[00:18:00] I would say yes.
[00:18:01] In other ways, I would not.
[00:18:02] And I was thinking about this because I
[00:18:04] knew I was going to come talk to you.
[00:18:07] If you look at what's taking place in the world right now,
[00:18:12] I think if more people had more adversity growing up,
[00:18:17] that they would be able to thrive more.
[00:18:20] I mean, I'm going to get elected to Congress next year.
[00:18:22] That's happening.
[00:18:23] Actually, this year in November, I'll take office next year.
[00:18:26] And I started from the meanest circumstances you possibly can.
[00:18:29] I mean, abject real poverty, broken home, single mom,
[00:18:32] enlisted guy in the Navy.
[00:18:34] And I'm going to be in the highest levels of power
[00:18:37] in the most powerful country in the world
[00:18:39] within a single generation.
[00:18:42] I tell people all the time, man, what's that called?
[00:18:46] It's the American dream, right?
[00:18:47] I mean, the embodiment of the American dream.
[00:18:49] I lived on five of the seven continents as a frogman.
[00:18:52] Africa, I lived in villages.
[00:18:54] In Afghanistan, I lived in cosmopolitan European cities,
[00:18:58] Iraq, in Asia, everywhere.
[00:19:00] And it's the American dream, man.
[00:19:01] It's not the Argentinian dream.
[00:19:04] It's not.
[00:19:04] It's not the English dream.
[00:19:05] It's not.
[00:19:06] It's the American dream because this is the only place
[00:19:08] my story can happen every day, like all the time.
[00:19:10] Look, it wins some serious.
[00:19:12] Yeah.
[00:19:12] Yeah.
[00:19:13] Amazing.
[00:19:13] Immigrant to the United States,
[00:19:14] she's the lieutenant governor of Virginia.
[00:19:16] So that's what I think is important about these growing up
[00:19:21] where things aren't handed to you as much.
[00:19:23] Because I fought for everything I've had,
[00:19:25] everything my entire life.
[00:19:27] And I know what that means.
[00:19:29] And then I can assign value to that.
[00:19:32] So I'm guessing you didn't quite see this trajectory
[00:19:36] when you were putting some premium gas into some guy's
[00:19:39] Chevy for $4.75 an hour.
[00:19:43] Because I worked at Wendy's.
[00:19:44] Did you really?
[00:19:45] Yeah.
[00:19:45] I worked at Wendy's.
[00:19:46] What did you do there?
[00:19:47] I was the burger cook guy, which I would
[00:19:50] make burgers.
[00:19:51] And it's interesting.
[00:19:52] You go to Wendy's, the burgers are fresh,
[00:19:54] which means when eight people walk in,
[00:19:56] they make a rough guess.
[00:19:57] Sure.
[00:19:58] And they'll go, put on 10.
[00:19:59] So you put on 10.
[00:20:00] And if two of them don't sell, they go into a bucket.
[00:20:03] And that bucket gets turned into chili.
[00:20:05] But you know.
[00:20:05] I did not know that.
[00:20:06] Yeah.
[00:20:07] So I'm working at Wendy's.
[00:20:09] And I knew I wanted to go in the military at some point.
[00:20:13] At what point did the military seem like the call?
[00:20:16] Actually, let me hear the worst day
[00:20:18] of the 17-year-old van-o working at the gas station.
[00:20:23] Not eating.
[00:20:25] Just no food.
[00:20:26] Just not eating.
[00:20:28] Not enough money.
[00:20:29] You got to make rent.
[00:20:31] And I got to pay for gas for a car.
[00:20:34] I bought a, I'd say, 1969 Toyota Corona.
[00:20:39] Corona.
[00:20:40] Corona.
[00:20:40] Not a Corona.
[00:20:41] Corona.
[00:20:42] It was built in September, 1969, same month and year
[00:20:44] that I was born.
[00:20:45] It was red with a white racing straight, man.
[00:20:46] 500 bucks.
[00:20:47] Boom.
[00:20:48] Cash on the back.
[00:20:48] On the barrel head, right?
[00:20:50] You got to pay for gas because you got to go to work.
[00:20:52] You got to make rent.
[00:20:53] And sometimes you don't have money for food.
[00:20:55] And what's tragic, Jaco, is that people are getting there,
[00:21:00] again, in America.
[00:21:01] They're having to make those decisions.
[00:21:03] And it's shocking.
[00:21:04] So yeah, not eating was, you know.
[00:21:06] I mean, right now, clearly, that's going to be a good thing,
[00:21:08] dude.
[00:21:09] I tell people, like, we're nine meals.
[00:21:11] Could use some more of that, right?
[00:21:12] We're like, we're nine meals away from Anarchy at any point,
[00:21:15] right?
[00:21:16] And I'm like, 15 to 20 meals away from Anarchy.
[00:21:19] Let's be honest.
[00:21:22] I could be a castler for a while.
[00:21:23] That may be a good thing.
[00:21:25] So sometimes you're not eating.
[00:21:27] You're 16.
[00:21:28] You're 17.
[00:21:29] You're still working at the gas station.
[00:21:30] At what point do you go?
[00:21:31] So I went out.
[00:21:32] This ain't working.
[00:21:33] Check.
[00:21:33] I went out with a buddy of mine.
[00:21:35] His name was Kurt.
[00:21:36] And you know, we're trying to baron.
[00:21:39] We're in Oregon.
[00:21:40] And I'm like, let's join the Marine Corps.
[00:21:43] And he's like, yeah, let's join the Marine Corps.
[00:21:45] So we go out and we get all tuned up.
[00:21:47] And we're like the best Marines for six hours.
[00:21:50] And I wake up and I call him.
[00:21:52] I'm like, I do not want to join the Marine Corps.
[00:21:54] He's like, I do not want to join the Marine Corps.
[00:21:56] I go, let's join the Navy.
[00:21:57] He goes, OK.
[00:21:58] I picked him up.
[00:21:59] We went to their recruiting office.
[00:22:00] What?
[00:22:01] No.
[00:22:02] That was it.
[00:22:02] That was exactly as much thought that went into it.
[00:22:04] Now remember, now Gunny was, he was a Marine.
[00:22:08] My guy that I aspired to be.
[00:22:11] What made you say like you're fired up
[00:22:13] to go to the Marine Corps six hours later?
[00:22:14] I don't think so.
[00:22:15] What was?
[00:22:17] Sobriety.
[00:22:18] That's what happened.
[00:22:21] Did you understand anything about the military?
[00:22:24] And we're just like, hey, Navy, Marine Corps, that seems cool.
[00:22:29] They got cool uniforms.
[00:22:31] They carry machine guns.
[00:22:32] Yeah, no.
[00:22:32] And you know what?
[00:22:33] It's interesting if you want to, I mean, not to over-spiritualize
[00:22:36] things or get too philosophical about stuff.
[00:22:38] Sounds like we're about to.
[00:22:39] Sure.
[00:22:40] There's been several inflection points in my life.
[00:22:43] Or it's just kind of like, throw your chips to the wind
[00:22:45] and see what happens.
[00:22:46] Because at that point, I was going nowhere.
[00:22:48] And I realized that.
[00:22:50] I guess alcoholics call it an epiphany.
[00:22:54] You have this moment.
[00:22:56] And I kind of had that moment where I realized this is just not,
[00:23:02] I don't want to live this way the rest of my life.
[00:23:05] And so there had to be a change.
[00:23:06] And how do you change like that?
[00:23:08] I'm a high school dropout.
[00:23:09] I couldn't get accepted.
[00:23:10] I didn't know any of that stuff, right?
[00:23:13] And it just really, it was an epiphany.
[00:23:16] So I joined the Navy.
[00:23:17] Did you have to get your GED?
[00:23:18] How'd that work?
[00:23:19] I guess they gave me six months to get a GED.
[00:23:21] I was offered three different programs.
[00:23:23] Seaman apprenticeship, fireman apprenticeship,
[00:23:25] and airman apprenticeship.
[00:23:27] That's it.
[00:23:27] There was no other options.
[00:23:29] So just so everyone knows what that means, that means.
[00:23:32] Menial labor.
[00:23:33] The lowest jobs, the most menial jobs
[00:23:36] that you can get in the Navy.
[00:23:37] Those three jobs in the three different broad departments
[00:23:41] in the Navy.
[00:23:41] Yeah, straight up menial labor.
[00:23:43] And so I just like, OK, I signed on.
[00:23:48] I got stationed at Naval Weapons Station Concord.
[00:23:50] Hold on.
[00:23:51] Yeah, sorry.
[00:23:52] You said it took you six months to get your GED before you
[00:23:54] could leave?
[00:23:55] They're like, so I wanted to dab the late entry program.
[00:24:00] They said once you're active duty, you have six months
[00:24:02] to get a GED.
[00:24:03] So I went to my first duty station, Naval Weapons
[00:24:05] Station Concord.
[00:24:05] What year was this?
[00:24:06] 1988.
[00:24:07] 1988?
[00:24:08] Man, they were hurting for some people then.
[00:24:10] Listen, dude, Reagan wanted the 600 ship Navy.
[00:24:13] That's right.
[00:24:13] You could like, where's Harry Kimming's trenching?
[00:24:16] So you could like wipe the blood off a knife you just
[00:24:19] stabbed somebody with.
[00:24:20] And they're like, don't do that again.
[00:24:21] And they'll let you in the Navy.
[00:24:22] But come on in.
[00:24:23] Right.
[00:24:24] But now, that's something I was alluding to earlier,
[00:24:26] is that our standards now, people have not faced this
[00:24:30] adversity.
[00:24:31] And so we're taking, we're setting all these prerequisites
[00:24:34] for guys to go to different programs, especially
[00:24:35] specialized programs.
[00:24:36] That were kind of unrealistic.
[00:24:39] But yeah, so I would drive up over the Benisha Bridge.
[00:24:42] I can't remember the name of that.
[00:24:43] Meri Island.
[00:24:44] And I would take classes.
[00:24:45] And I took my GED and got that within the six months.
[00:24:49] So you were 18 when you actually get in the Navy?
[00:24:51] I was 18.
[00:24:51] I turned 19 in boot camp.
[00:24:53] OK.
[00:24:53] So you turned 19 in boot camp.
[00:24:54] How was boot camp?
[00:24:57] You know what I mean?
[00:24:58] It was just boot camp.
[00:24:59] Was it a shock to your system where you like?
[00:25:01] No.
[00:25:01] I was not one of those guys.
[00:25:02] Were you totally happy to be there?
[00:25:05] It's three hots and a cot, man.
[00:25:07] You like food.
[00:25:09] Yeah.
[00:25:09] I mean, yeah, apparently.
[00:25:13] Everyone understands what you're saying.
[00:25:17] So yeah, I mean, it was just what you're doing.
[00:25:19] And that's kind of how I live my life.
[00:25:22] I approach it.
[00:25:23] Like, this is what we're doing.
[00:25:25] And so let's just do it.
[00:25:26] Let's crack on and let's do it the best that we can.
[00:25:29] And that really paid off in buds.
[00:25:31] I'll tell you a story, though.
[00:25:32] So in order to get to buds, right,
[00:25:35] I joined the Navy.
[00:25:36] I'm working on my.
[00:25:37] Do you know about the seals at this point?
[00:25:38] I had no idea.
[00:25:40] They wasn't like, hey, Derek, check this out.
[00:25:41] By the way, you can never do this.
[00:25:42] You're going to be working on it because you're a scrub.
[00:25:45] That's essentially what I said.
[00:25:46] So I cleaned toilets and painted.
[00:25:47] So you get done with boot camp.
[00:25:49] Where do you get stationed?
[00:25:50] Naval weapons station, Concord.
[00:25:52] Concord, California, it's closed now.
[00:25:54] There's an ammunition station.
[00:25:55] You show up there.
[00:25:56] You're an E1.
[00:25:57] Maybe an E2.
[00:25:58] No, I made E2.
[00:26:00] I can't remember.
[00:26:01] E1, E2 doesn't matter.
[00:26:01] But you're a very low ranking individual.
[00:26:03] Right.
[00:26:04] But I still had this sort of, you know,
[00:26:07] I was a smart aleck, you know, to put it mildly.
[00:26:11] You're a smart aleck at 50.
[00:26:13] How old are you?
[00:26:14] 53.
[00:26:14] You're a smart aleck at 53.
[00:26:16] When we worked together, you were a smart aleck at 40-something.
[00:26:19] So I can only imagine it was even worse when you were.
[00:26:22] Here's the difference, Jaco.
[00:26:24] I have now earned it.
[00:26:26] I've earned it.
[00:26:27] When I was a young man, I didn't.
[00:26:30] I was a brash young man.
[00:26:31] And I didn't have humility.
[00:26:33] And so I decided to go to core school
[00:26:37] because I had a friend who worked at the clinic.
[00:26:39] And I wanted to go do that.
[00:26:41] So I had to work for six months, eight months, or whatever.
[00:26:44] After hours, I struck for a rate for all your civilians
[00:26:49] that's applying for a job.
[00:26:51] Did you apply for the job as Corman?
[00:26:54] I was a, right.
[00:26:55] So I made BM3, Bosin's Mate, third class, decorating.
[00:27:01] And then I went and became a Corman.
[00:27:03] But so here was the turn.
[00:27:05] A quarter inch shackle turned my life around.
[00:27:09] And that's a shackle.
[00:27:11] I don't know how to describe that.
[00:27:12] It's a fastener.
[00:27:14] It's a fastest and not a metal thing, right?
[00:27:16] So I was standing on the fan tail of the YTB.
[00:27:20] That's Yard Tug Boat 828, Karakasa, all yard tug boats
[00:27:24] in the Navy were named after American Indian chiefs,
[00:27:27] in case you're wondering.
[00:27:28] So I'm on the fan tail, that's the back of the boat.
[00:27:31] And I get beamed in the back of the head
[00:27:33] with a quarter inch shackle.
[00:27:35] And I turn around and there's nobody there.
[00:27:39] And I'm like, if I don't change my ways,
[00:27:42] these people will kill me.
[00:27:45] And that really opened.
[00:27:48] That was a reality check.
[00:27:49] And I don't encourage changing people's behavior
[00:27:53] modification through violence, but I'm just
[00:27:55] telling you my story.
[00:27:56] And I was like, wow, I need to change my ways now.
[00:28:04] And I did.
[00:28:06] And then I got to course school.
[00:28:07] So you have to apply to go to course school?
[00:28:09] Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:10] So I worked at the clinic on base after hours.
[00:28:13] And it was like six or eight months.
[00:28:15] And I had to take a series of tests.
[00:28:17] I did all these general military trainings.
[00:28:19] I did a whole bunch of correspondence courses,
[00:28:21] like the NATO handbook on surgery and all these things,
[00:28:24] which is a course for physicians.
[00:28:27] I ordered it.
[00:28:27] Used to be able to order all these books through the Navy.
[00:28:30] And I just have a knack for it.
[00:28:32] I know I seem like a goofball, but I'm actually
[00:28:36] a knack for nerding out and studying on something
[00:28:39] and passing tests.
[00:28:40] Because I had been reading since a kid.
[00:28:41] You know what I mean?
[00:28:43] It wasn't strange to me to garner knowledge
[00:28:46] from the written word.
[00:28:47] And so being able to read things, absorb information,
[00:28:51] and then take things from disparate sources,
[00:28:54] combine them together to understand the best way
[00:28:57] to do things is just something I'm just good at.
[00:28:59] It's intuitive to me.
[00:29:01] I don't have to work at that.
[00:29:02] So you apply to go to course school?
[00:29:04] Right.
[00:29:05] And then I got accepted.
[00:29:07] And I put everything I owned in the entire world
[00:29:09] on the back of my motorcycle and drove like everything.
[00:29:13] Drove from Concord, California to San Diego
[00:29:16] and checked into course school later.
[00:29:17] How long is course school?
[00:29:20] About 11 weeks, I think.
[00:29:22] I mean, that was a while ago, dude.
[00:29:24] They didn't even have course school here anymore.
[00:29:25] And you still haven't heard about the SEAL teams yet?
[00:29:27] No.
[00:29:27] So I did.
[00:29:28] So that revelation must be coming.
[00:29:29] OK.
[00:29:30] So there was three guys that joined the Navy to be SEALs.
[00:29:37] One's name is Rodney.
[00:29:38] Unfortunately, he was killed working for the CIA
[00:29:41] after he got out of the teams.
[00:29:42] He graduated.
[00:29:43] Another one's name is Andy.
[00:29:44] He did.
[00:29:45] I don't know, ex-money ears got out.
[00:29:46] And the other one's name is Jeff.
[00:29:48] And Jeff didn't make it to Buds.
[00:29:50] Anyway, they're like, hey, I'm going to be a SEAL.
[00:29:52] This is at course school?
[00:29:53] This is at course school.
[00:29:54] And they're all like, brrr.
[00:29:56] And I'm me.
[00:29:58] And I'm like, what's the SEAL stuff?
[00:30:00] They're like, well, you have guns and planes and boats
[00:30:03] and fast cars.
[00:30:05] I'm like, well, I'll go do that.
[00:30:07] And they're like, you can't just say I'll go do that.
[00:30:10] And I go, well, why not?
[00:30:11] Why can't you just say I'll go do that?
[00:30:14] So I was kind of mocked a bit.
[00:30:16] And then you had, at that point, three chances to take
[00:30:20] this screening test.
[00:30:22] Did you do the same thing?
[00:30:23] What class were you?
[00:30:24] 177.
[00:30:25] OK, so I was 184.
[00:30:26] And so remember you had three chances.
[00:30:28] Oh, no, you're eating, weren't you?
[00:30:30] Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:31] I just did it in boot camp.
[00:30:32] Oh, because they let you do that.
[00:30:34] Yeah.
[00:30:35] Yeah.
[00:30:36] I did it in boot camp, passed.
[00:30:38] Yeah, so I failed this twice.
[00:30:41] And back then, like you failed the street times, you're out.
[00:30:43] We don't want to see you again.
[00:30:44] You're dead to the world.
[00:30:45] Get out of here.
[00:30:46] This is while you were a corpsman?
[00:30:47] This is while I was in core school.
[00:30:49] I was in a corpsman.
[00:30:50] To get billet to buds.
[00:30:50] To get a billet to buds.
[00:30:51] Got it.
[00:30:52] And you failed once.
[00:30:53] What'd you fail?
[00:30:54] Swim.
[00:30:55] OK.
[00:30:55] I didn't know how to do the side stroke.
[00:30:57] I've been swimming since I was a kid.
[00:31:00] I just don't know how to do a formal stroke.
[00:31:02] So I failed this thing twice.
[00:31:04] And they started renovating the barracks, which
[00:31:06] is not the oldest, but the second oldest building in San
[00:31:10] Diego at the Naval Hospital.
[00:31:12] That was our barracks.
[00:31:13] So they move us to 32nd Street, the Navy based on there.
[00:31:17] And by now, this is a personal thing at this point,
[00:31:20] because the push-ups, sit-ups, run.
[00:31:23] I don't know if you did dips.
[00:31:24] Anyway, crush all of them.
[00:31:26] Crush all of them.
[00:31:27] Can't do the swim.
[00:31:28] So I go to the pool.
[00:31:29] There's a nine-year-old kid in the pool.
[00:31:31] And he's doing the side stroke.
[00:31:33] And I'm like, hey, dude, can you show me?
[00:31:35] Because there was no mentoring.
[00:31:37] Remember that?
[00:31:37] It was like, go do this.
[00:31:39] No mentoring.
[00:31:39] I go, hey, man, can you show me how to do that?
[00:31:42] A nine-year-old kid.
[00:31:44] He's like, yeah.
[00:31:45] Just grab an apple, pull the apple down.
[00:31:46] Get it with your hand through the apple way.
[00:31:48] Grab another apple.
[00:31:49] Oh, no, man.
[00:31:50] Look at that.
[00:31:50] This kid was good.
[00:31:52] Right.
[00:31:52] That's a side stroke.
[00:31:53] So I did it past the test.
[00:31:57] That quarter in shackle gave me the humility, which
[00:32:00] was the thing that I was missing as a young man,
[00:32:03] to be able to ask a nine-year-old kid how to do the side
[00:32:06] stroke.
[00:32:07] And then I went.
[00:32:08] So somebody hawked that thing at you, this shackle?
[00:32:10] Yeah.
[00:32:11] And they just didn't give a shit.
[00:32:13] No.
[00:32:14] Listen, man.
[00:32:15] I mean, right in the back of the head.
[00:32:19] And then so, you know, there's a type of which
[00:32:21] are actually beautiful boats.
[00:32:22] There's big wide and phantome on the back.
[00:32:24] And then there's the old one level,
[00:32:26] which is where the coxswain's flat is, the wheelhouse.
[00:32:32] Clearly, they were up there.
[00:32:35] So I've had the ability, Jaco.
[00:32:37] And I think you have also an echo.
[00:32:39] Unfortunately, I don't know you well enough.
[00:32:41] I'm hopefully well.
[00:32:42] I don't.
[00:32:42] Whatever you're going to say, I doubt he has.
[00:32:45] There's people in the world that have the ability
[00:32:48] to understand when they're taking part in history
[00:32:50] or things that are significant to the point where
[00:32:52] that you should modify your behavior.
[00:32:54] Well, that's what I think.
[00:32:55] One of the key points about this is a lot of times,
[00:32:59] when you get hit in the head with a shackle,
[00:33:02] you look at everyone else and say,
[00:33:03] I can't believe they're doing this to me.
[00:33:06] I can't believe that someone.
[00:33:07] You get mad.
[00:33:08] You get mad at the Navy.
[00:33:09] You get mad at the people on your tugboat.
[00:33:12] You get mad at everybody else.
[00:33:15] When what you actually need to do is say, well,
[00:33:17] there's only one person I can control, and that's me.
[00:33:20] I'm the one that got myself on the back of this tugboat.
[00:33:23] I'm the one that got myself around these bunch of people.
[00:33:25] I need you something to get out of here.
[00:33:26] I need to take ownership of my life and move forward.
[00:33:29] And that's a huge difference.
[00:33:31] And it's a huge difference in mentality
[00:33:33] that can be the difference between staying where you're at.
[00:33:36] I mean, you obviously did the same thing at the gas station.
[00:33:39] At some point, you're like, you know, being hungry sucks.
[00:33:42] And I could be mad at my paycheck at the gas station.
[00:33:44] I could be mad at my car for using gas.
[00:33:48] Or I could say, hey, I put myself in this situation.
[00:33:50] I need to get myself out of it.
[00:33:51] Where's the recruiter?
[00:33:53] So that's the thing that you're talking about when
[00:33:57] you explain that to me.
[00:33:58] I think, yeah, well, that's going to have,
[00:33:59] that's the difference between moving forward, moving up,
[00:34:02] improving your station and life, or staying where you're at.
[00:34:06] Yeah.
[00:34:07] And if you have the wherewithal to do things,
[00:34:12] you should do things.
[00:34:14] I mean, some things are just that simple.
[00:34:16] You can sit around and hang out, or you can continuously
[00:34:20] try to improve yourself.
[00:34:22] And so I've got friends like that.
[00:34:24] One of them I got to give a shout out to is Mike Emmer.
[00:34:26] He's a dude up in our village in Butternut.
[00:34:28] He's just always doing things.
[00:34:30] He just got into sailing with his family now.
[00:34:32] So he sails in.
[00:34:33] This is a farmer who now has this big boat, sailboat,
[00:34:37] that he runs his kids around Lake Superior
[00:34:40] because he is always, him and Liz, she's just wonderful,
[00:34:44] have always kept their eyes open.
[00:34:46] And when people have their head down,
[00:34:48] we talk about that earlier with your posture,
[00:34:50] you just don't see the world around you.
[00:34:52] And I made a conscious decision to not do that.
[00:34:57] I made a conscious decision to be part of the equation.
[00:35:01] And I think more people, they should understand that.
[00:35:06] Not to get overly political here,
[00:35:07] but I talk to people, I'm like, hey, you can go outside
[00:35:12] and you can stare at a hill.
[00:35:14] It doesn't matter how long you look at that.
[00:35:15] The Calvary's not coming over the hill.
[00:35:17] They're not coming.
[00:35:19] It's you.
[00:35:20] You are the Calvary.
[00:35:21] So when you care enough about something,
[00:35:24] you've got to understand you are the person that
[00:35:27] can affect positive change.
[00:35:28] And so I empower people.
[00:35:29] And I go talk to them.
[00:35:30] I go, look, man, we always talk about the guys
[00:35:33] jumped into San Maria Gliese or whenever the beach is in Normandy
[00:35:35] or the Marines in Quezon and Vietnam
[00:35:37] or in the Argonne Forest in World War I.
[00:35:41] We think about them as these people that at the singular point
[00:35:45] in time when their country, our country needed them,
[00:35:47] they stood up.
[00:35:49] And they bodily entered into something
[00:35:52] knowing that they may not come back alive.
[00:35:56] In the same vein, that's who the people that care
[00:36:00] about the United States are now.
[00:36:01] Now, I hope to God they never have
[00:36:02] to get involved in physical combat.
[00:36:04] We've both been there.
[00:36:05] And it's a horrible thing.
[00:36:07] And war should be horrible so people
[00:36:09] don't want to get engaged in it.
[00:36:10] But they're doing that now.
[00:36:13] And they have to show courage because courage is contagious.
[00:36:16] We've seen this.
[00:36:17] A lot of people out in the civilian world have not.
[00:36:19] And I'll give them an example that people can understand
[00:36:22] because it's kind of funny.
[00:36:23] During the lockdown, I think it's 323.10.
[00:36:29] It was this statute in the Wisconsin state law
[00:36:32] that says that the governor has the ability
[00:36:34] to exercise emergency powers.
[00:36:36] It's like a 30-day window.
[00:36:37] So I'm like, OK, check.
[00:36:38] I don't know what's going on.
[00:36:39] It's like, if your dude's in combat, you're like, go do this.
[00:36:42] It's like, well, sir, I think we should have an emergency
[00:36:45] situation.
[00:36:45] Boom.
[00:36:46] Got it.
[00:36:46] But then when that emergency ends or the legal authority ends,
[00:36:50] then it's time to challenge authority.
[00:36:51] The same person that is a law-buying citizen,
[00:36:55] that's your duty to follow the law when you're
[00:36:57] in a crisis situation.
[00:36:59] It's the same person that says, no.
[00:37:02] When that expires, that is your duty as a citizen.
[00:37:07] It's to stand up for what's right.
[00:37:08] Anyway, so this lockdown is going on.
[00:37:12] And I'm like, I'm no longer compliant.
[00:37:14] The legal authority has expired.
[00:37:16] I will not do this.
[00:37:17] I'm not.
[00:37:18] So I go to Walmart because I'm a smelly, dirty Walmart shopper.
[00:37:21] I am.
[00:37:22] And I don't have a mask on.
[00:37:23] And someone recognizes me.
[00:37:24] They have a face shield and a mask on.
[00:37:28] And the dude looks at me and he's like, what are you doing?
[00:37:31] I go, I'm not complying.
[00:37:33] And he said, well, I'm not either.
[00:37:35] And he takes his stuff out and throws it into his cart
[00:37:38] in Walmart.
[00:37:39] And courage is contagious.
[00:37:42] Wait, he didn't die immediately?
[00:37:43] No.
[00:37:44] But listen, don't get me wrong.
[00:37:47] I had COVID twice.
[00:37:49] And it was horrible.
[00:37:50] And a lot of people died from it.
[00:37:52] And if you want to wear a mask right now, wear it.
[00:37:54] I mean, 100%.
[00:37:55] If you want to wear a mask and a face shield,
[00:37:56] you want to wear gloves, you want to hand sanitize,
[00:37:59] and all that stuff, that's your ability as an American citizen
[00:38:01] to choose the way you want to live your life.
[00:38:04] And now everybody's coming around.
[00:38:05] The CDC just said that.
[00:38:07] People should be able to choose.
[00:38:08] So they should have been able to choose.
[00:38:09] Back then, I wrote an op-ed in April of 2020
[00:38:12] called Freedom of War for Fear.
[00:38:14] And it laid it out like, you got to pick.
[00:38:16] Because you can't have both.
[00:38:17] What's your book?
[00:38:19] Extreme Ownership?
[00:38:20] Well, there's a bunch of them.
[00:38:21] The Icon of Leadership?
[00:38:22] But you talk about fear and stuff, right?
[00:38:24] Oh, Like You the Dragons.
[00:38:26] The Kids Book.
[00:38:26] OK, Mindkiller, right?
[00:38:29] You can't function if you're terrified.
[00:38:31] So I think it's just a different way
[00:38:34] of thinking about how we should interact as citizens.
[00:38:38] And so you want to do that stuff, go ahead.
[00:38:40] I'm just not going to.
[00:38:41] I will not join you.
[00:38:42] But I won't mock you either, because it's your choice.
[00:38:46] All right, speaking of your choices,
[00:38:47] you choose to figure out how to swim from this nine-year-old
[00:38:50] kid.
[00:38:50] Now you pass your test.
[00:38:51] I pass my test.
[00:38:52] And you're going to Buds.
[00:38:54] I go to Buds.
[00:38:56] Did you have any clue about Buds at this point?
[00:38:59] Absolutely nothing.
[00:39:00] And again, that's why I succeeded.
[00:39:03] So I do it.
[00:39:05] 184 and graduated with 184.
[00:39:07] Neil Roberts, first guy killed in Afghanistan.
[00:39:09] We have got our.
[00:39:10] I was a team two with him, yeah.
[00:39:11] OK, so we had our arms over each other's shoulders
[00:39:13] graduating from Buds.
[00:39:15] I mean, he's a great man.
[00:39:16] They call him Thiefy.
[00:39:18] Yeah, super guy.
[00:39:19] But so I got there and I'm like, I don't know what to do here.
[00:39:22] And I show up at like, you go to A.B. Brights.
[00:39:25] Is that still there?
[00:39:26] That area cleaner?
[00:39:27] Yeah, OK.
[00:39:27] So you've got your pants that you can stand up by themselves.
[00:39:31] Because they're so starched.
[00:39:32] Like, seriously, that's not a joke.
[00:39:34] You can stand them up.
[00:39:35] And so it's like, I pay all this money
[00:39:38] to have these things done.
[00:39:40] And I go down.
[00:39:41] I'm not going to say.
[00:39:42] I don't know what his first name is.
[00:39:43] I'll just call him C. That's the first letter of his last name.
[00:39:46] I don't know what a embarrassing guy.
[00:39:48] And it's like four in the morning.
[00:39:50] I'm wearing this uniform.
[00:39:52] And I'm walking like, what is that?
[00:39:54] Pillsbury Doeboarder, anyway.
[00:39:57] Or Gingerbread Man or whatever.
[00:39:58] And this guy comes up to me and he looks me up and down.
[00:40:02] This is an instructor?
[00:40:03] No.
[00:40:03] This is a fellow student.
[00:40:05] He looks me up and down.
[00:40:06] He goes, you're not going to make it.
[00:40:09] Like whispers to me.
[00:40:11] And I'm like, well, what do I do now?
[00:40:14] I pay all this money for these uniforms.
[00:40:16] Like, do I get a refund?
[00:40:17] Or do I leave?
[00:40:20] And so I'm like, all right.
[00:40:22] Well, I guess I'm not going to make it.
[00:40:24] And so I go to class.
[00:40:26] And you know, one thing leads to another.
[00:40:28] And it's very difficult.
[00:40:29] Seal training in case you haven't read a book or anything.
[00:40:34] And then it occurred to me.
[00:40:35] I mean, I actually have a more, again, another one
[00:40:37] of these epiphanies, when I understand exactly what the deal
[00:40:40] is.
[00:40:42] We're sitting on the beach.
[00:40:44] We're PT. And we're looking in towards the compound.
[00:40:47] So the oceans that are back.
[00:40:49] And the instructor, he's looking out to sea.
[00:40:54] And we're exercising.
[00:40:56] And it starts to rain, which is bad.
[00:40:58] But you'll get through it.
[00:41:00] And then it starts to lightning and hail.
[00:41:02] It's like storm.
[00:41:03] The rare, rare accursion for San Diego.
[00:41:05] Exactly.
[00:41:06] So working on that tugboat, moving ammunition,
[00:41:10] when it's their hero.
[00:41:11] I can't remember.
[00:41:12] Oh yeah, hero condition.
[00:41:13] Hero condition.
[00:41:14] Right.
[00:41:14] That's when there's electric stuff there.
[00:41:16] You've got to stop.
[00:41:17] Things will blow up.
[00:41:18] And so I'm thinking, wow, this is bad.
[00:41:21] We're standing on the beach.
[00:41:22] The only thing we don't have is a golf club holding up there.
[00:41:25] And the instructor, he goes and halt in buds.
[00:41:29] That's not like smoking me if you got him.
[00:41:31] You're standing at rigid attention.
[00:41:32] He runs into the compound.
[00:41:33] I'm like, well, good.
[00:41:34] We're going to get us off this beach.
[00:41:36] We've got to get out of here.
[00:41:37] It's a lightning storm.
[00:41:38] And he comes running back out.
[00:41:41] And he has a dive mask on.
[00:41:44] And I'm like, oh, I get it.
[00:41:47] This is the contract.
[00:41:50] So my part of the contract was I'm
[00:41:53] going to show up here every single day
[00:41:55] and do everything I possibly can to meet your standard.
[00:41:59] My instructor is not my standard.
[00:42:01] Your standard.
[00:42:02] And his part of the contract was he's
[00:42:05] going to show up every single day and make sure
[00:42:07] that I adhere to his standard.
[00:42:10] And it was like a light bulb appeared above my head.
[00:42:12] So it's just raining so hard that he needed a dive mask.
[00:42:15] Because he couldn't see if we were performing the functions
[00:42:17] to his standard.
[00:42:18] Check.
[00:42:20] So that was it.
[00:42:22] I'm like, I get buds at this point.
[00:42:24] Well, how deep were you in the buds a couple weeks?
[00:42:26] That was PTRR.
[00:42:28] Oh, so you weren't even classed up yet.
[00:42:32] So when I started, there was guys with like sandbag.
[00:42:35] So they're like, you have to do the O-Chorus.
[00:42:39] And I'm just making up these numbers now in 10 minutes.
[00:42:41] And then they had to be 930.
[00:42:43] And you had this progression, right?
[00:42:45] So they would do it just passing on purpose.
[00:42:49] Because I knew there were better athletes in me.
[00:42:51] And I took the opposite approach.
[00:42:53] I was like, I'm going to get up every single day
[00:42:54] and try as hard as I can for everything I do.
[00:42:57] Like every single thing I do.
[00:42:59] And then I'm going to get better.
[00:43:01] I'm not going to stay the same or decrease.
[00:43:06] I will get better.
[00:43:07] And I know I can do this because there's somebody
[00:43:09] who tried it making me do it.
[00:43:12] So it's possible.
[00:43:13] And so I did that.
[00:43:15] That's how I got through the buds.
[00:43:16] And I swear, man, third phase out at the island,
[00:43:18] we're flying back.
[00:43:19] And I was certain that plane was going to crash.
[00:43:23] Because there was no way I could be graduating from Buds.
[00:43:25] You know what I mean?
[00:43:26] What was the, what do you remember about like Hell Week?
[00:43:30] Was Hell Week a challenge for you?
[00:43:32] It was, but I was a booker leader.
[00:43:33] Because I was an E4.
[00:43:34] Oh, you were an E4.
[00:43:35] I was an E4.
[00:43:36] Wheel of some heat, dude.
[00:43:37] And I've found, yeah.
[00:43:41] I have found personally that when you are in a leadership
[00:43:43] position and you have people that you need to be concerned
[00:43:46] about, then you're putting their care above your own,
[00:43:49] which I've done my whole life.
[00:43:50] So that was just something that you do.
[00:43:53] That it actually makes the time go by better.
[00:43:57] Because you're not worried about yourself.
[00:43:59] You're not focusing internally.
[00:44:01] This is hard.
[00:44:02] I'm freezing.
[00:44:02] And I'm chafed or whatever.
[00:44:04] You're looking out for your men.
[00:44:06] And you get this.
[00:44:07] But you're like, this person is having a bad time.
[00:44:11] And what can I do from my position to make this better
[00:44:16] for them so that we can accomplish the mission?
[00:44:20] And if someone couldn't make it in Buds, people are like, oh,
[00:44:24] you should help them and carry them along.
[00:44:25] I took, again, the opposite approach.
[00:44:27] If this person can't get through Buds and we're going to
[00:44:30] carry him through Buds, what are they going to be like when
[00:44:33] they get to the skill teams?
[00:44:35] So you can take that to an extreme.
[00:44:37] If somebody was having a bad day, you help them out.
[00:44:40] But if someone was consistently performing below par, I don't
[00:44:45] want them around.
[00:44:47] So for me, Hell Week was very challenging.
[00:44:52] But at the same time, I think it was easier for me than any
[00:44:54] of the guys on my boat crew.
[00:44:56] Because they were more focused on them getting through this.
[00:45:01] And I was more focused on getting us through it.
[00:45:04] I liked Hell Week because there's nothing I could fail.
[00:45:07] Like everything else.
[00:45:08] Because I wasn't good at anything.
[00:45:09] I wasn't good at running.
[00:45:11] I wasn't good at swimming.
[00:45:11] I wasn't good at the O-Course.
[00:45:12] I wasn't going to tell everybody that.
[00:45:14] I was always like, I could fail this swim.
[00:45:17] I could fail this run.
[00:45:18] I had to just put out so hard.
[00:45:20] But Hell Week was like, oh, we just got to finish?
[00:45:22] Bro, I could do that.
[00:45:23] Just not quit?
[00:45:24] That's my game.
[00:45:26] Want to play that game?
[00:45:27] That's my game.
[00:45:27] No sleep and no quitting?
[00:45:29] That's my game.
[00:45:30] If there was a pro sport, I'd be doing good at that sport.
[00:45:34] So Hell Week for me was fun.
[00:45:35] What about the water?
[00:45:36] Was the water all good for you?
[00:45:37] Pool, comp, and all that stuff?
[00:45:39] Yeah, so I failed pool comp the first time.
[00:45:42] Me too.
[00:45:43] Do you know why I failed pool comp the first time?
[00:45:45] Because I forgot the end of the brief.
[00:45:47] What was the end of the brief?
[00:45:49] Kiss the regulator and ascend.
[00:45:51] What you did just ascend?
[00:45:52] I sat there.
[00:45:54] So I did the whole everything.
[00:45:56] And I just forgot the end of the brief.
[00:45:57] Kiss the regulator and ascend.
[00:45:58] And McCarthy was my instructor.
[00:46:01] Did you see him around?
[00:46:02] Oh, yeah.
[00:46:02] Yeah, he'd, brrr, and he pulls me out of the pool.
[00:46:05] He's like, what is wrong with you?
[00:46:06] And I go, what do you mean, Secretary McCarthy?
[00:46:08] He goes, dude, if you had just kissed the regulator
[00:46:12] and ascended, you'd be fine.
[00:46:13] And I was like, oh, check, Raj.
[00:46:14] That's the end of the brief.
[00:46:17] So no, the water workers fine.
[00:46:18] I might have to struggle swims.
[00:46:20] But um.
[00:46:21] Like passing swims?
[00:46:22] You're a slow swimmer?
[00:46:24] Dude, a nine-year-old taught me how
[00:46:25] to do the side stroke like two weeks before I went to Butts.
[00:46:29] So in fact, yes, I was a slow swimmer.
[00:46:33] It was actually about three months before I went to Butts,
[00:46:35] because in that interim period from core school,
[00:46:38] to going to Butts, I worked at the Naval Hospital.
[00:46:40] And I collected dirty linen.
[00:46:43] Awesome.
[00:46:43] But I also, so the linen collection shop at Balboa
[00:46:48] and Naval Hospital, I don't know if it's still there,
[00:46:49] was down in the basement right next to the morgue.
[00:46:52] And I was like, I'm going to go to Butts training.
[00:46:54] And I should understand more about human physiology,
[00:46:58] because I'm going there.
[00:47:00] And so I would go do, it's like Wednesday morning,
[00:47:03] he's got a name Braswell.
[00:47:05] He was the autopsy instructor.
[00:47:07] So I would go do these autopsies.
[00:47:10] You know, I would stand there.
[00:47:11] I finally worked my way up to weighing organs.
[00:47:14] But just to really truly understand physiology.
[00:47:16] Because you read that in a book, and you
[00:47:18] can do a cadaver lab and that sort of stuff.
[00:47:20] But when you have something that is newly deceased,
[00:47:25] you have a much better understanding of how things truly
[00:47:27] work in your body.
[00:47:28] It was a fascinating experience, actually.
[00:47:30] That was an interesting little off-ramp.
[00:47:32] We just took into the morgue.
[00:47:34] Well, I mean, so I was a corpsman.
[00:47:37] And then I went to the 300F1 program down in San Antonio,
[00:47:40] Texas after I graduated from Butts.
[00:47:42] And then I went, finally, after two platoons at Team 4
[00:47:47] in South and Central America and then Bosnia-Hurts, Govenia,
[00:47:50] I finished the 18 Delta Course, of which
[00:47:52] I was the distinguished undergraduate of my class.
[00:47:54] In case you want to go.
[00:47:55] Boom.
[00:47:55] You know why?
[00:47:56] Because I didn't want to go.
[00:47:59] Because I was a frogman.
[00:48:00] And I want to take six months off to go work with the Army,
[00:48:03] going to school anywhere.
[00:48:04] I want to stay in a platoon.
[00:48:05] That was my thing.
[00:48:06] If you're a seal, you should be in a platoon.
[00:48:08] And if you're in a platoon, you should be at war.
[00:48:10] That's it.
[00:48:11] And God bless them.
[00:48:13] The guys who do 27 years at trade ed and mar ops instructors.
[00:48:16] Thanks.
[00:48:17] That's so known.
[00:48:18] I also have to do that.
[00:48:19] But you get the deal.
[00:48:20] The SEALS natural environment is combat.
[00:48:22] Cut, try, period.
[00:48:23] Over.
[00:48:25] But yeah, so I didn't want to go.
[00:48:27] And I'm like, Army, Special Forces guys.
[00:48:29] I have so many SF friends.
[00:48:31] They're good dudes.
[00:48:32] I'm like, how do I beat them?
[00:48:34] Academically.
[00:48:36] So they're very serious about academics.
[00:48:39] That course was really hard.
[00:48:41] That was a hard course.
[00:48:41] I didn't go through it.
[00:48:42] But I remember, you would kick guys' asses.
[00:48:44] So when I graduated, the commander
[00:48:47] had to give me their commander's excellence going.
[00:48:50] You loved that.
[00:48:50] It was just like their hand is shaking.
[00:48:52] Like, argh.
[00:48:54] So and it was just very, very interesting.
[00:48:57] And if you're going to do your job, do it the best you can.
[00:48:59] And that's just, I mean, everyone should
[00:49:01] take that approach of life.
[00:49:03] Have you ever seen this documentary called Hero Love Sushi?
[00:49:08] I have not seen it.
[00:49:09] But I know about it.
[00:49:10] It's fascinating.
[00:49:11] I started watching it, bro.
[00:49:12] And honestly, it didn't really grab me.
[00:49:14] And I don't have a bunch of time to be watching movies that
[00:49:17] aren't getting me out of the gate.
[00:49:18] And it just didn't do it.
[00:49:19] I'll get to it at some point.
[00:49:21] I think when I'm older, like maybe 65, 70,
[00:49:24] I'm going to roll into that.
[00:49:25] Because I've heard it's great.
[00:49:26] And I think I was totally focused.
[00:49:27] And he has the most popular sushi place in the world.
[00:49:31] And there's the hard to get to.
[00:49:33] And it's this little shack on the side of the road
[00:49:35] or whatever, a really small thing.
[00:49:37] And he's the best in the world.
[00:49:38] What I got out of all of that is that you
[00:49:39] have the attention span of a net.
[00:49:41] I may.
[00:49:42] I may.
[00:49:43] So this guy's talking about, you don't have
[00:49:47] to be proud of your job.
[00:49:49] But you have to be proud of your work.
[00:49:51] Interesting.
[00:49:52] That's the whole crux of that movie.
[00:49:53] That's why it's so fascinating.
[00:49:55] And you've got to get to that.
[00:49:57] So you can be doing anything.
[00:49:58] Just do it the best you can.
[00:49:59] That's 100%.
[00:50:00] And by the way, that's the way.
[00:50:01] If you don't like your job, the way out of your job
[00:50:04] is to do the job to the absolute best of your ability.
[00:50:08] The way to stay in your shitty job that you don't like
[00:50:10] is to not perform well at it.
[00:50:12] And it's not going to work out well for you
[00:50:14] to stay in that job.
[00:50:14] Or you're going to get an even worse job.
[00:50:17] So you're flying back from San Clementi Island,
[00:50:18] which means you're graduating from Buds.
[00:50:21] And you get stationed.
[00:50:22] Where do you get?
[00:50:23] Silt team four.
[00:50:24] Did you pick East Coast?
[00:50:25] I picked Silt team four.
[00:50:26] And this is why.
[00:50:28] Because Silt team four was the only Silt team
[00:50:31] I was aware of that had been in combat since the Vietnam War.
[00:50:34] And just like we just talked about, man,
[00:50:36] a Silt's natural environment is combat.
[00:50:39] So I put that as my first choice.
[00:50:42] Because I thought that was the team that
[00:50:44] has the highest probability of entering into combat.
[00:50:48] That was in Panama.
[00:50:51] That was Panama was 1989.
[00:50:54] So now it's 1991.
[00:50:57] October 23, 1992, I graduated from Buds.
[00:50:59] So it was in 93-ish or whatever.
[00:51:01] So at the time, that was it, man.
[00:51:06] And these guys.
[00:51:07] Yeah.
[00:51:08] And at the time.
[00:51:09] Our products operations and all that stuff.
[00:51:10] Yeah.
[00:51:11] At the time, the Silt teams were geographically oriented.
[00:51:14] And so that meant that different teams
[00:51:16] had different geography that they covered.
[00:51:18] And Silt team four at the time covered Central and South
[00:51:22] America.
[00:51:23] Which means every Spanish speaking person in the Silt
[00:51:26] teams went there immediately.
[00:51:28] And there was things going on down there.
[00:51:32] There was the counter drug stuff.
[00:51:34] There was revolutions going on.
[00:51:35] So that sounded like a good place for you,
[00:51:39] the way you looked at it.
[00:51:40] That's where you wanted to go.
[00:51:41] Yeah.
[00:51:41] And I tell you what.
[00:51:42] You were smart of me.
[00:51:43] You know, I wanted to go to Silt team one
[00:51:44] because I thought we were going to NAM.
[00:51:47] I was like, bro, team one, Vietnam.
[00:51:50] There's got to be stuff going on.
[00:51:52] You know, I went to Vietnam in 1998.
[00:51:54] That's awesome.
[00:51:55] On the recovery missions.
[00:51:56] During task force full time.
[00:51:57] Yeah.
[00:51:59] Yeah, man.
[00:51:59] So I went to team four.
[00:52:00] I did two platoons there.
[00:52:02] How was it when you showed up at team four?
[00:52:03] Because that's the other thing.
[00:52:04] At team four.
[00:52:05] And that was a guy had a bunch of friends that went to team four.
[00:52:08] And team four was like an awesome team at that time.
[00:52:10] Yeah.
[00:52:10] Team four was the East Coast equivalent of team five.
[00:52:16] Much more relaxed and but super, super professional.
[00:52:20] So you would do, I think, six weeks of land warfare at Pickett.
[00:52:24] And then you'd go down to Panama and you spent your first month
[00:52:27] and a half living in the jungle.
[00:52:29] I actually did that trip from team one.
[00:52:31] Did you really?
[00:52:31] Yep.
[00:52:32] We went down there and did 34 days or something out in the J.
[00:52:35] Right.
[00:52:36] So you seriously knew what you're doing.
[00:52:38] And I really appreciated that a lot.
[00:52:41] And that's why I volunteered to go to TrayDead
[00:52:45] because I was not satisfied with our land warfare training.
[00:52:48] I thought it was completely inadequate.
[00:52:51] Coming from that background at team four.
[00:52:53] So I did those two platoons.
[00:52:54] And then here's your job.
[00:52:56] Cormand and intelligence.
[00:52:57] Oh, that's right.
[00:52:58] You were a medic.
[00:52:59] Medic and intel.
[00:53:00] So I did eight platoons as a Cormand and a medic.
[00:53:04] And I mean, you don't really do that anymore
[00:53:05] once you become a chief.
[00:53:06] But it was still my specialty.
[00:53:08] My forte.
[00:53:09] And how were those deployments?
[00:53:11] They were very interesting.
[00:53:13] I mean, I got my first.
[00:53:15] So this is like 94.
[00:53:16] You're going on your first deployment?
[00:53:18] 94, 95.
[00:53:19] 94, 95 deployment.
[00:53:20] I got my first Navy achievement medal when I was in STT
[00:53:25] at the time, which was interesting.
[00:53:27] I told you, because I got my second down on my first deployment.
[00:53:30] The first one was because some guy got shot at a basketball
[00:53:33] outside of a grocery store in Virginia
[00:53:35] and went and saved his life, as you do.
[00:53:38] And then there was another terrific accident.
[00:53:42] So I was a new guy.
[00:53:43] But I'm like, I stick to my guns.
[00:53:45] And I paid the man for it several times.
[00:53:49] But I would insist on bringing my medical gear back to it.
[00:53:52] We were staying in four different condos in Salinas, Ecuador.
[00:53:57] And I would insist of packing up all of my medical gear
[00:54:00] and taking them back to my room every night after training.
[00:54:03] And like, new guy, we want to go there.
[00:54:05] I'm like, I don't care.
[00:54:07] Tune me up if you want, but I'm going to have my stuff.
[00:54:10] Like 2 o'clock in the morning, big thing.
[00:54:12] This car was driving, and they lost control
[00:54:17] and hit a cement telephone pole.
[00:54:20] They just split the car in half and shot bodies
[00:54:22] all over the street.
[00:54:24] So I was like, holy beanbags.
[00:54:27] And I had all my stuff and made the Naval base.
[00:54:32] This is written in the soul, Navy Tune Metal.
[00:54:35] And made the Navy base reopen their clinic
[00:54:39] and had all my stuff and all the guys.
[00:54:40] My god.
[00:54:41] But I miss sometimes being around SEALs
[00:54:44] because they just perform.
[00:54:45] You're like, bam.
[00:54:46] They can be sitting around doing something.
[00:54:47] They are on it.
[00:54:49] So everybody has that nascent medical training,
[00:54:52] and they all just perform.
[00:54:53] I'm like, this, this, this, God, check.
[00:54:55] We saved everybody's lives.
[00:54:58] So that was part of the reason that this deployment was so
[00:55:02] terribly interesting.
[00:55:04] And then 96 rolls around.
[00:55:08] 95, 96 rolls around.
[00:55:10] And the war was going on in Bosnia-Hurtskivina.
[00:55:15] So is this now your second platoon?
[00:55:16] This would be my, this wasn't even a platoon.
[00:55:19] I had done two platoons.
[00:55:20] And this was like kind of an augment thing.
[00:55:22] It was really great.
[00:55:23] So they're trying to figure out a way
[00:55:27] to implement the Dayton Accords that were signed in 1995
[00:55:30] after Storm 95, which is a Croatian offensive that
[00:55:33] kept the Serbs back.
[00:55:35] So they signed this Dayton Accords,
[00:55:37] and they're trying to figure out how to implement them.
[00:55:38] Prior to that, there was a program called the Joint
[00:55:41] Commission Observers, and those were tier one guys that
[00:55:43] were going in and doing JTAC stuff and whatever.
[00:55:48] And so this transitions to how are we going to maintain this
[00:55:51] presence on the ground.
[00:55:52] So they transitioned from the tier one guys to the theater
[00:55:55] soft, and SF had this mission.
[00:55:58] And they wouldn't let us do it.
[00:56:00] Were you around for, what were you doing?
[00:56:02] So what year is this?
[00:56:04] 96.
[00:56:05] 96, I was in training, because I was at SEAL Team 1.
[00:56:08] OK.
[00:56:08] So you remember the JCO stuff?
[00:56:09] Were guys going to go to Bosnia?
[00:56:11] So they come back on the grind or Team 4,
[00:56:14] which is just part of a compound.
[00:56:16] I'm on the East Coast.
[00:56:18] And they're like, OK, SF can't man this mission.
[00:56:22] We're going to let SEALs do it.
[00:56:23] So everyone was like, yeah, we're going to war.
[00:56:26] Excited, right?
[00:56:27] And they go, we're taking E7 in the bus.
[00:56:29] No, ha!
[00:56:29] And I'm like, I'm going to E5.
[00:56:32] So I'm like, come on, man.
[00:56:34] So everybody goes to the language lab, signs up.
[00:56:36] This is something that I learned.
[00:56:38] And I think I'm not sure.
[00:56:41] I hope that I'm wrong.
[00:56:42] But I see the military going back to the way it was in the 90s.
[00:56:46] Politically and all this stuff, right?
[00:56:48] I mean, I do believe we are auguring in.
[00:56:50] The Department of Defense is broken right now.
[00:56:53] So everybody goes and signs up on this legal pact.
[00:56:57] And then they call them in, rank, one, the next, next,
[00:57:01] next, next.
[00:57:02] And everyone's like, well, actually, I got to mow my lawn.
[00:57:05] Well, my daughter's in soccer.
[00:57:06] Well, they worked their way down.
[00:57:09] They get down to E5 Derek.
[00:57:11] So some of the guys that signed up weren't really wanting to go.
[00:57:15] You understand this concept when you're standing in a group
[00:57:19] and you need to be like, oh, going to war?
[00:57:21] Yeah, I'm a seal.
[00:57:22] That's great.
[00:57:22] And they get really excited about it.
[00:57:23] But then when you get them on one-on-one,
[00:57:26] they don't want to be there.
[00:57:27] You know what I mean?
[00:57:27] They join the canoe club.
[00:57:29] They want to work out and all that stuff.
[00:57:32] That transcends all spectrum.
[00:57:34] That's not unique to seals.
[00:57:35] So they get down to me.
[00:57:38] And that's freaking crazy, dude.
[00:57:39] Right.
[00:57:40] And so I go in to see my CNC.
[00:57:44] His name is Perry.
[00:57:45] It's a total redneck, awesome guy.
[00:57:48] And he goes, well, Van Orden, what you doing?
[00:57:51] I go, Mass Chief, General Patton had to petition General
[00:57:57] Pershing as a second lieutenant to be included on his
[00:58:01] expedition during the Mexican-American War.
[00:58:04] And he goes, you try to tell me.
[00:58:05] You some kind of GD General Patton?
[00:58:09] He did not abbreviate that.
[00:58:11] And I said, no, Mass Chief.
[00:58:12] But I'm telling you, my bags are packed right now.
[00:58:14] And I can leave in 10 minutes.
[00:58:15] And he's like, beat it.
[00:58:17] Now, at this point, are you married?
[00:58:20] You're married.
[00:58:21] When did you meet your wife?
[00:58:22] In San Diego, right before.
[00:58:26] Right before I went to Buds, we got married right after Buds.
[00:58:29] Got it.
[00:58:30] So I spent, I was a seal for just under 22 years.
[00:58:34] I spent 16 years away from home.
[00:58:37] So I took every single training trip.
[00:58:40] I went to every single school I could.
[00:58:41] Because again, you have to find, if you're doing
[00:58:44] something, do it.
[00:58:47] And that's a biblical principle.
[00:58:49] Be either hot or cold.
[00:58:50] If you're lukewarm, I will spit you out.
[00:58:51] That's in the Bible, man.
[00:58:53] So if you're doing something, do it.
[00:58:56] And so I got every single qualification I possibly could.
[00:58:59] So in case something came up, I would be the one selected to
[00:59:02] do it to go defend my country.
[00:59:05] I mean, I'd live my life that way, right?
[00:59:07] How fast did you have kids?
[00:59:09] Did you have kids when you got to team four?
[00:59:12] By the time we got to team four, we had two kids.
[00:59:15] Damn.
[00:59:16] Yeah.
[00:59:16] And we have four now.
[00:59:17] I have eight grandchildren.
[00:59:19] Impressive.
[00:59:19] Gosh, they're so awesome.
[00:59:21] Everything you hear about being a granddad?
[00:59:24] Not even close to how cool it is.
[00:59:26] Seriously, they're just wonderful.
[00:59:28] But yeah, so I went on that deployment.
[00:59:30] It was very interesting.
[00:59:32] I remember, so we had these different houses.
[00:59:35] I didn't live in a base.
[00:59:36] My house was Whiskey 40.
[00:59:38] So it was multinational division Southwest.
[00:59:41] I worked for a guy named John Cass, was a British colonel.
[00:59:44] Reported to a special operations command
[00:59:46] and control element, SOC-C. That was in Ponyluka.
[00:59:48] The guy named Repass.
[00:59:50] Mike Repass was a major at the time.
[00:59:52] I wound up working for him again when he was a two star in Germany.
[00:59:54] It was really cool.
[00:59:55] But we went into Sarajevo, we fly in.
[01:00:00] We went to another joint commission observer house, the SF guys.
[01:00:03] And kind of like slowly get you in.
[01:00:06] There's two seals there in my house.
[01:00:07] And we moved out to Bugano, the town where they've been.
[01:00:12] And then like seven to nine SF guys.
[01:00:14] I get up every morning.
[01:00:15] I drive out and I talk to all the military and local political
[01:00:20] figures and police figures.
[01:00:21] And the mission was to provide a ground truth about what's going on.
[01:00:26] And I had so much responsibility as an E5,
[01:00:32] like to plan these missions and go out.
[01:00:34] And I had like a pistol and a butt pack with one other seal
[01:00:38] with a pistol and a butt pack.
[01:00:39] And you're going out and talking to these people
[01:00:42] who just want to kill you.
[01:00:44] And the level of, I guess the Yiddish term would be,
[01:00:50] hutzpah.
[01:00:51] You've got to get out there.
[01:00:52] And I'll give you this example, man.
[01:00:54] So we go up to Banyaluka to the 117th VRS.
[01:00:59] That is a Serbian military unit.
[01:01:03] I wanted to go check in with these cats.
[01:01:05] And it's kind of on sort of on a little hill.
[01:01:08] But back then for SACOM, you had to have the right look angle
[01:01:12] and ask.
[01:01:12] Remember?
[01:01:13] Like you had a point at a Saturday.
[01:01:14] I was a calm guy.
[01:01:14] So yeah.
[01:01:14] OK, yeah, right.
[01:01:15] You get it.
[01:01:16] Other people don't.
[01:01:17] Where's my phone?
[01:01:18] I can talk to it.
[01:01:20] Anyone?
[01:01:20] Anywhere.
[01:01:20] Right.
[01:01:21] So back then you had to like, boom, I had to get the satellite.
[01:01:24] So I had, I do the math problem.
[01:01:26] I look at where I'm going.
[01:01:27] I realize that I'll have to point this antenna into a mountain.
[01:01:33] And I'm not getting comms.
[01:01:35] And there were no cell phones, right?
[01:01:37] So I understand that, you know, it's just me and my buddy,
[01:01:40] Meg.
[01:01:41] So we go up there.
[01:01:42] And I'm late.
[01:01:44] Or excuse me, we're on time.
[01:01:46] This guy's not there.
[01:01:46] His name was Chulich, Colonel Chulich.
[01:01:49] We walk in and there's this dude standing right there
[01:01:53] who has got rosy cheeks like mine, huge white beard,
[01:01:57] fatter belly than me.
[01:01:59] And I'm like, oh my gosh, this guy looks like Santa Claus.
[01:02:02] And I start chuckling.
[01:02:03] So this is a Serbian base.
[01:02:04] Remember, NATO had been bombing the Serbs.
[01:02:07] And they are.
[01:02:08] Yeah, well, isn't it 64 days or something?
[01:02:10] Right.
[01:02:10] They want no part of us.
[01:02:11] And so they are not happy.
[01:02:14] And they're like, what are you talking about?
[01:02:17] And my term, his name is Zoran Azuminidich.
[01:02:20] We call him Zorca because he was fat and like Zorca, like Orca.
[01:02:25] OK, got it.
[01:02:25] Right.
[01:02:26] So Zoran, they're like, he's starting to worry.
[01:02:31] And they're like, what are you laughing at?
[01:02:33] I go, all right, well, it looks like this is going down right now.
[01:02:37] And there's like 400 Serbs there.
[01:02:40] And two of us, we have 31 rounds of 9 millimeter with us.
[01:02:45] Like that's it.
[01:02:46] So I go, OK, hey, in the United States,
[01:02:48] we have a guy whose name is Santa Claus.
[01:02:49] And you look just like him.
[01:02:51] That's what we're laughing at.
[01:02:52] And they start laughing.
[01:02:53] They go, oh, they're Serbian Orthodox.
[01:02:55] They have St. Nicholas.
[01:02:55] They're like, that's what we call him too.
[01:02:58] I was like, OK.
[01:03:00] And then so we sit down at this table.
[01:03:02] Chulich, yeah, that really happened.
[01:03:04] It gets.
[01:03:05] All of a sudden, an international incident,
[01:03:06] because you were laughing at Santa's.
[01:03:08] I couldn't help it.
[01:03:09] Right, it gets more banana.
[01:03:10] So we're sitting at this huge table.
[01:03:13] And Chulich is supposed to show up at the head of the table.
[01:03:16] And whenever you use an interpreter,
[01:03:17] you put him in between you and whoever you're talking to.
[01:03:20] So they should just be a conduit for language.
[01:03:25] So he's sitting there.
[01:03:26] This guy's just late, late, late, late.
[01:03:28] We're sitting there drinking chlivovica, just plum brandy.
[01:03:32] Excellent, actually.
[01:03:33] In France, they call it O2D, water of life.
[01:03:36] Maybe it's a mirror bill, in case you're wondering.
[01:03:38] So this guy finally shows up.
[01:03:41] And my radio is in this rucksack.
[01:03:44] And this dude, he's dressed like a Russian mafia guy.
[01:03:47] This is the dude that just showed up?
[01:03:49] The colonel who should have been there three hours before.
[01:03:51] He was in Bon Jovi, goofing off.
[01:03:53] Anyway, black leather jacket, hair slicked back.
[01:03:55] And he's like, you know, Serbians are great warriors.
[01:04:00] I'm like, yeah, they are.
[01:04:02] He goes, Serbians kept Europe safe from the Ottomans
[01:04:07] for 300 years.
[01:04:08] I'm like, yeah.
[01:04:11] Serbians could kick NATO out of here anytime we want.
[01:04:14] I look at him, I go, you see that radio?
[01:04:17] Right there?
[01:04:18] You keep that up.
[01:04:19] I'm going to rain fire from the sky on you in 10 minutes.
[01:04:22] Is that clear?
[01:04:23] And Zoran, remember, I'm going to eat five, dude,
[01:04:26] talking to this Serbian colonel.
[01:04:27] So Zoran's there.
[01:04:28] He's just like, like, instant sweat.
[01:04:31] Like he just ate a ghost pepper.
[01:04:34] And he's like, I go, Zoran, you tell him exactly what I said
[01:04:39] right now, or you're out of here.
[01:04:41] And he's like, OK.
[01:04:45] You keep that up.
[01:04:46] He's going to rain fire from the sky on you in 10 minutes.
[01:04:49] And Tula just like, what I meant to say was the Serbians
[01:04:53] and NATO can have an effective working relationship
[01:04:55] to make sure that we secure peace and Bosnia.
[01:04:57] I'm like, go check.
[01:04:58] So we get down at the meeting.
[01:05:00] It went really well after that.
[01:05:01] We get back in the car and Zoran's like,
[01:05:03] Derek, you know where you're at?
[01:05:04] And I go, yeah, I'm in Kula Camp.
[01:05:06] And he goes, do you know what happened to Kula Camp?
[01:05:08] I'm like, no.
[01:05:09] So what I failed to notice is that all these buildings
[01:05:12] were freshly painted and everything was nice.
[01:05:14] They'd been destroyed.
[01:05:15] They'd been destroyed by NATO.
[01:05:17] So when I told that guy, I'll be raining fire from the sky
[01:05:20] on you in 10 minutes.
[01:05:24] He understood what that meant.
[01:05:27] That terribly interesting.
[01:05:28] That's crazy.
[01:05:29] That's when I was at E5, dude.
[01:05:31] Yeah.
[01:05:32] That's crazy the amount of responsibility you can get.
[01:05:35] Yeah.
[01:05:36] We had in the military.
[01:05:39] I was one of the guys that ran the six platoons.
[01:05:42] The mission was de-classified in 2009.
[01:05:44] So we protected the top six Iraqi officials.
[01:05:47] And during the election cycle, I
[01:05:49] had this guy named Ibrahim Al-Jafri.
[01:05:51] So I was a platoon chief this time.
[01:05:53] So this is team one?
[01:05:54] No, this would be team five.
[01:05:56] So I was at team four.
[01:05:58] And then I went to 18 Delta.
[01:06:01] I went to team one.
[01:06:02] OK, so.
[01:06:03] I'm going to pay a comp platoon there.
[01:06:04] So hold on.
[01:06:05] Slow down a little bit.
[01:06:05] So you're at team four.
[01:06:08] You get done at team four.
[01:06:09] Correct.
[01:06:10] And you get done with the Spositing Deployment,
[01:06:12] which is an awesome deployment.
[01:06:13] But back then, it's like you were.
[01:06:14] It was the only war we had.
[01:06:15] The most stoked you could possibly be at that time.
[01:06:20] And then you get forced to go to 18 Delta against your will.
[01:06:24] Right.
[01:06:24] But you go down there and kick ass.
[01:06:26] Correct.
[01:06:26] Graduate number one guy in the class.
[01:06:27] That is correct.
[01:06:29] Now what happens?
[01:06:31] OK.
[01:06:33] So I was supposed to go to Damneck.
[01:06:36] You know all you have to see, daddy's,
[01:06:37] and they lay out your whole plan for you.
[01:06:39] And the corpsman detailer is for same as Tom.
[01:06:41] He's a very good guy.
[01:06:42] I don't worries that now.
[01:06:43] So the plan was for me to finish 18 Delta.
[01:06:46] And at that point, they were only taking 8490 ones.
[01:06:49] That's the senior level.
[01:06:50] It's for your audience.
[01:06:51] So there's 8492s.
[01:06:52] That's the basic Special Forces medic.
[01:06:55] And then the full graduate of the Army Special Forces
[01:06:58] medical sergeant's corps.
[01:06:59] That time Damneck was only taking these guys.
[01:07:02] So that's why I had to go to 18 Delta.
[01:07:04] Tom sets all the set.
[01:07:06] But then I'm sitting there.
[01:07:08] Remember, this is 98, 99-ish.
[01:07:11] And I had been gone for the five and plus years I was at team
[01:07:15] four.
[01:07:16] And Sarah and I had three kids at the time.
[01:07:19] She's a San Diego native.
[01:07:21] And I really felt horrible.
[01:07:23] You know what I mean?
[01:07:24] Because I'm a husband and a dad and all this stuff.
[01:07:26] And her family's still here.
[01:07:28] They're wonderful.
[01:07:30] So I was like, you know what?
[01:07:32] I'm going to ask to get assigned to the West Coast
[01:07:35] so that I can continue to work as a frogman as I should.
[01:07:38] But she'll have more support network around me.
[01:07:40] Or around her, sorry.
[01:07:41] So we're sitting in this meeting.
[01:07:46] Tom pulls all the corps around.
[01:07:47] Where do you want to go?
[01:07:48] Where do you want to go?
[01:07:49] And he's asking them, bam, bam, bam, east coast, west coast,
[01:07:51] whatever.
[01:07:52] And he looks to me and he's like just skipping over me.
[01:07:55] And I said west coast.
[01:07:57] And he was like, what?
[01:07:59] I go, yeah, west coast, man.
[01:08:01] He's like, check.
[01:08:03] Goes around everybody.
[01:08:04] I put in five, because that was the team four.
[01:08:07] Then I put in three.
[01:08:08] Then I put in one.
[01:08:09] Now this is the person that decides where you are going.
[01:08:13] Like it is up to him.
[01:08:15] Where did I go?
[01:08:16] Team one.
[01:08:17] He was so mad at me personally.
[01:08:21] And it was a great experience there.
[01:08:23] But it was just so different.
[01:08:26] Like I got yelled at, I would say,
[01:08:29] 40 times in the first two months I was there.
[01:08:31] Because I had the wrong pair at team one.
[01:08:32] At Stalard team one.
[01:08:33] When did you get there?
[01:08:35] Gosh, he was 98, late 98.
[01:08:37] So FAC was there.
[01:08:38] And you know, the overshadings.
[01:08:39] So I left in 98.
[01:08:41] OK, so that's.
[01:08:41] So you had just, we just missed.
[01:08:43] I left.
[01:08:45] I left in the spring of 98.
[01:08:49] So if you didn't get there until.
[01:08:51] I can't remember.
[01:08:53] I deployed in 2000.
[01:08:55] So whatever that cycle would be.
[01:08:57] So yeah, I left in the spring of 98.
[01:08:59] But yeah, at that time, just we called team one, Stalard team
[01:09:04] one, because it was like strict.
[01:09:05] And it was traditional and it was uniform inspections
[01:09:08] and haircut inspections and all these kind of things
[01:09:11] were going on.
[01:09:12] And I loved it.
[01:09:14] And well, that's why you wrote a book called
[01:09:16] like Discipline Equals Freedom.
[01:09:17] And I didn't.
[01:09:19] Let's just be really clear about that.
[01:09:20] You know what I mean?
[01:09:21] Yeah.
[01:09:22] And it's one of those things where, you know, that's where I
[01:09:24] was kind of raised, you know, from a young kid to, you know,
[01:09:27] that's where I've got all my first experience.
[01:09:30] And you know, like you talk about faculty,
[01:09:32] faculty was like my.
[01:09:34] It's a legend.
[01:09:35] And like a legit friend who looked out for me and my group
[01:09:40] of friends, we were all kind of his boys.
[01:09:44] And you know, we worked, we freaking busted our ass.
[01:09:46] And that's what, you know, what happened?
[01:09:48] I remember you checking out because you were there with Chris.
[01:09:51] Yeah.
[01:09:51] Yeah.
[01:09:52] Yeah.
[01:09:53] Yeah.
[01:09:53] That's when I was.
[01:09:54] And I was I was I was sailor of the year at team one.
[01:09:57] Well, yeah, that was.
[01:09:58] But I was the only five in history.
[01:10:03] You made E5 or I was.
[01:10:05] You're a Z five.
[01:10:06] Silt and one as any five, which was crazy.
[01:10:08] But part of that was because of fact, like fact, like, you know,
[01:10:11] I was worked hard for fact.
[01:10:13] I worked right for him in training cell and stuff.
[01:10:16] But yeah, it was this very strict environment of much more
[01:10:19] militaristic than the other teams.
[01:10:22] And I went from there to team two and team two was similar.
[01:10:25] Right.
[01:10:25] That was it was.
[01:10:26] No, we call it.
[01:10:27] Yeah, it was pretty solid.
[01:10:29] They're the same.
[01:10:30] They were they were the same.
[01:10:31] Tilting one and till team two were definitely on the spectrum
[01:10:35] of way more militaristic way.
[01:10:37] So that's and you know what happened at team one, a lot of guys
[01:10:40] from team one would hate it and would go to team five.
[01:10:46] They would go down the street, team five and just be like, oh,
[01:10:48] now we can like act like humans.
[01:10:50] Right.
[01:10:50] And be chill.
[01:10:51] And so and that would be cool.
[01:10:53] That's a that's a nice transition.
[01:10:54] Your transition in the opposite direction is not a nice transition.
[01:10:57] It was like I'd had the wrong Paris.
[01:10:59] There's like a matrix.
[01:11:00] So Dean Cummings, who is he's a great dude.
[01:11:02] I mean, he was the CMC there.
[01:11:04] And it was always like fan art and you know, this hat and the socks
[01:11:08] and this shoes and whatever.
[01:11:09] I'm like, so finally I go, hey, Mastery, remember, I've done two platoons.
[01:11:13] One combat deployment to Bosnia was the I got the defense
[01:11:17] maritory service medal as the most highly decorated guy for my rotation
[01:11:21] because of some other stuff that I did there.
[01:11:23] Right.
[01:11:25] Honor graduate of my Army Special Forces Medical Stardust course.
[01:11:27] I'm not some new guy that just fell off, you know, the Bud's train.
[01:11:31] Right.
[01:11:32] I am experienced at that point.
[01:11:34] I was a journeyman seal.
[01:11:35] Yeah.
[01:11:36] You know what I mean?
[01:11:37] Not a master.
[01:11:37] I was a journeyman.
[01:11:39] And finally, I'm like, hey, Mastery, can I get like a matrix
[01:11:42] of what I can wear with what?
[01:11:44] Because I'm not doing this on purpose.
[01:11:46] I just don't know what you expect me to wear every day.
[01:11:50] So P.T. is this and then you change it.
[01:11:52] He was like fan art and I go, I'm not joking.
[01:11:55] Yeah.
[01:11:55] Then he realized I was sincere.
[01:11:57] Yeah.
[01:11:57] You know, because.
[01:11:58] Dude, the guy you're talking about, Chris, who's like one of the biggest
[01:12:01] studs in human history, but we were in Bud's together.
[01:12:05] Yeah.
[01:12:05] And then we get to team one and we're going on a run like we're new guys.
[01:12:09] Yeah.
[01:12:09] And he walks out for the run.
[01:12:10] He's wearing a visor, like a visor like, you know, like, I don't know.
[01:12:14] He still wears a visor.
[01:12:15] We used to cut those.
[01:12:16] The hat off.
[01:12:17] Yeah.
[01:12:17] So he walks out with a visor on and faculty who didn't know us at the time,
[01:12:21] we're just new guys, looks at him and he goes, if I see you wearing that again,
[01:12:26] I'm sending you to the fleet.
[01:12:28] Like, like we just got that with Bud's and he's telling him he's going to send
[01:12:33] him to the fleet.
[01:12:35] Yeah.
[01:12:35] And by the way, this guy, Chris is like this, a total stud in every way.
[01:12:40] He's one of those mutant humans.
[01:12:42] Yeah.
[01:12:42] He's a mutant human.
[01:12:43] That is incredible.
[01:12:43] And he relieved me in Iraq.
[01:12:45] Okay.
[01:12:46] I got a cool story about that.
[01:12:47] Remind me of that.
[01:12:47] Nice.
[01:12:49] So you eventually figure out what you got to do to keep your, keep forgetting
[01:12:54] your astute at the whole team one.
[01:12:55] Correct.
[01:12:56] Do a pay-com deployment and then force 21 came about.
[01:13:01] Remember that?
[01:13:02] Thankfully.
[01:13:03] Thankfully.
[01:13:03] Well, thankfully and no, there's some very distinct, I mean, like hardcore
[01:13:09] negative squalor because of force 21.
[01:13:12] The first and foremost one is it seals don't want to do stuff anymore.
[01:13:15] Yeah.
[01:13:16] I guess the thing is at that time, it was needed.
[01:13:20] It was needed and it was lucky because if we were gone from the old system into
[01:13:25] what we ended up deploying as once not 11, it would have been really much harder
[01:13:28] transition.
[01:13:29] We would have pulled it off.
[01:13:30] And when I say seals don't want to do stuff anymore, I mean, we're stone cold
[01:13:32] killers, right?
[01:13:33] That's not changed.
[01:13:34] I just mean like the day to day sort of things.
[01:13:36] We've lost that.
[01:13:39] We've lost the ability to like learn how to sew your own gear because people, I
[01:13:43] know how to use an industrial sewing machine as did everybody in the
[01:13:45] seal teams because you'd make your own stuff in the parallel.
[01:13:47] Things like that.
[01:13:48] How do you build a duck and whatnot?
[01:13:50] But so.
[01:13:52] What was your job in your platoon at team one?
[01:13:55] I was a corpsman.
[01:13:56] So, so yeah.
[01:13:57] And I was a Intel guy.
[01:13:58] That's what I did.
[01:13:59] That's your thing.
[01:13:59] That's my thing.
[01:14:01] I got it.
[01:14:01] But so force 21 comes around and again, I was I was distinctly
[01:14:08] dissatisfied with the line of warfare training that I got at team one.
[01:14:12] I it was it was not adequate because remember I came from team four where you
[01:14:18] spent that was what you did.
[01:14:20] I mean, you lived in the J and so I'm like, there's no war going on.
[01:14:24] There's nothing.
[01:14:25] I go, I'm going to and remember it was over at Brown or Turner field.
[01:14:29] What's the you know, next to the building's over in Coronado.
[01:14:33] What do we what do we talk about that field Turner field or yeah, Turner field.
[01:14:37] Yeah.
[01:14:38] Okay.
[01:14:38] So this is this is how discombobulated this wasn't it's fascinating.
[01:14:41] They just put the road cones like they put a road cone with like team one,
[01:14:44] team five, team three, trade at and you would go stand behind the road cone.
[01:14:48] That's how I got to trade it.
[01:14:50] I stood behind a road cone because that's how they figured out how to detail people.
[01:14:55] Yeah.
[01:14:56] It was kind of cool.
[01:14:57] Actually, it started cool, but it was a mess.
[01:14:59] And so I walk over to the building, the Starship, you know, I don't know if
[01:15:03] they're even there anymore, but the one that was shared by one and three and we
[01:15:07] started trade out.
[01:15:09] We had like the second floor or whatever it was.
[01:15:11] I walk in an empty room.
[01:15:12] It's me and Jeff Green.
[01:15:15] Then we're like, we're it like we're getting them trade land warfare.
[01:15:20] And so I went through everybody's safes in all of the teams and I took all of their
[01:15:27] documentation going back to the Vietnam War, you know, the type stuff, after action reports,
[01:15:33] and I consolidated all those things and we wrote all of the curriculum for land warfare
[01:15:38] and then special reconnaissance, taking the lessons and going back from our forefathers
[01:15:41] that gave us our, you know, fierce reputation and then worked those over and over again.
[01:15:47] But I get there, we start doing that and then September 11th happens and I was down.
[01:15:55] We lived in Navy housing and I'm like, what the heck?
[01:15:59] We got a phone call from a guy named Andy Dalton, retired SEAL Senior Chief, his wife,
[01:16:05] Cheryl, just beautiful people.
[01:16:07] It's wonderful.
[01:16:08] Oops, sorry.
[01:16:09] And he's that team too at the time and they're like, turn on your television.
[01:16:14] So we turn it on and we're like, what the heck is going on?
[01:16:17] And so I go, hey honey, keep the kids home from school.
[01:16:21] I do not know what's happening.
[01:16:22] I drive to the team area.
[01:16:24] We get snipers up in the building.
[01:16:26] We don't know what's happening.
[01:16:27] And I remember I went with this big VAT board, this big white board and I took a red marker
[01:16:32] and I wrote war and these big letters right there.
[01:16:36] And at that point we had desks and everything like war, like it's on.
[01:16:41] And so from that point on, I try to get out of there because we're at war, right?
[01:16:47] And a lot of people was the skipper there and every morning I go in his office just
[01:16:50] like I do parry beers.
[01:16:53] Like, okay, I'm ready to go back to the back.
[01:16:56] He's like, you're going to Afghanistan when I go to Afghanistan, Vano.
[01:16:58] And I'm like, ready to go every morning, every morning, ready to go, ready to go.
[01:17:02] And then we're going out to Nile and I think I was gone.
[01:17:04] I mean, like 290 days that year.
[01:17:07] Then finally he's like, okay, you can go leave me alone.
[01:17:11] So I weaseled my way into an L and O position for the siege of Sodov and I worked that for
[01:17:16] about a month and then I was down working for the chief of station in Kabul because
[01:17:20] I identified a problem.
[01:17:22] I looked at the entire spectrum of all of the operations that were taking place and
[01:17:27] I'm looking, we were completely, we were not employed to the capacity that we should be
[01:17:32] as seals and it's because we didn't have assets and authorities and all this stuff.
[01:17:36] So I laid this plan out and I'm like, if we tied this asset to this person who has control
[01:17:41] over this, then we can execute the mission better as seals.
[01:17:45] And I went to John, what was his name?
[01:17:49] Sileski.
[01:17:50] Colonel Sileski was the siege, siege of the commander.
[01:17:53] I said, Colonel, NAV's office not being employed to our capacity.
[01:17:56] And he's like, I know what's going on.
[01:17:58] I said, sure, if we do this, this, this, this and this and he goes, sorry, beat it.
[01:18:02] He was, he was the finest joint warfare fighter I've ever worked with.
[01:18:06] I mean, repass was another one.
[01:18:07] He's another army guy, unfortunately.
[01:18:09] I wish he could lay out this list of seal admirals.
[01:18:13] I can say that about, there's a few, but yeah, John was just, he was amazing.
[01:18:18] And he's like a down there and get it on.
[01:18:21] Fan, oh, what's up?
[01:18:22] Beat feet.
[01:18:23] So we tied together for theater soft, the first real interagency integration.
[01:18:31] Like biometrics.
[01:18:32] Remember biometrics?
[01:18:33] So everyone's like, so I was there and I was sitting around, you know, reflecting because
[01:18:40] you should reflect.
[01:18:41] And I was looking at one of those charts where it has all the people on a targeted list.
[01:18:47] And I was like, we don't know who is still around off this list.
[01:18:53] We don't know.
[01:18:55] And so I went and talked to a guy named Jax.
[01:18:57] He's still a super good friend of mine.
[01:18:58] He's the senior FBI agent in the country.
[01:19:01] And his office was right around the corner from my down in Kabul at the annex.
[01:19:06] And I'm like, Jax, how does the FBI know who people are after they're deceased?
[01:19:13] And he's like, well, you know, we do fingerprints.
[01:19:16] We do all the stuff.
[01:19:17] And I go, okay.
[01:19:19] So how do we do that here?
[01:19:20] And he's like, well, I don't know.
[01:19:22] I mean, this is a huge story.
[01:19:24] So I figured out a thing for us to be able to initially fingerprint folks.
[01:19:30] So the first time, this is why I am the force comp of the SEAL teams.
[01:19:35] So the first time that theater soft ever used biometrics in Afghanistan really in the war
[01:19:39] and terror was because I cooked up this idea with this dude who was on the Memphis SWAT
[01:19:43] team.
[01:19:45] And so we went out to this very complicated series of stuff.
[01:19:49] They see what 30 and 47s and all night and you know, big target deck and everything.
[01:19:54] And he had like the Johnny G man, you know, 1930s FBI fingerprint kit, the blue suitcase
[01:20:01] with the silver corners to fingerprint.
[01:20:05] These, you know, the enemy combatants that were no longer around.
[01:20:10] That's how all that started.
[01:20:11] That was an incredibly interesting thing, man.
[01:20:15] And then I rolled back and I went to team five where I was a potential.
[01:20:19] What year was that?
[01:20:20] What year was that?
[01:20:21] They were you in Afghanistan?
[01:20:22] 2003.
[01:20:23] I left October 13th, 2003.
[01:20:25] I remember that because it's the.
[01:20:28] That's when you left Afghanistan for my first tour.
[01:20:31] Yeah.
[01:20:32] Wait, you left for Afghanistan?
[01:20:33] No, I came back.
[01:20:35] Got it.
[01:20:36] I came back.
[01:20:37] So it took me, I was there for six or seven months.
[01:20:40] So, you know, do the math between September 11th to that point.
[01:20:44] But that's the birthday of the Navy.
[01:20:47] There you go.
[01:20:48] I was not aware of that.
[01:20:50] What?
[01:20:51] Yeah.
[01:20:52] I was like, horrible sailor.
[01:20:53] I'm horrible.
[01:20:54] I'm horrible sailor.
[01:20:55] Sorry about that.
[01:20:56] But, um, yeah, I came back and I went to team five where I was a potential.
[01:21:01] So you get to team five now it's 2003.
[01:21:04] So at this point we are full on like everyone's going to war.
[01:21:08] To win it.
[01:21:09] Iraq opened up right when I got back from Afghanistan.
[01:21:11] I can't remember when we invaded, but it was right around there.
[01:21:13] I saw it was so the plan for that was 1003 Victor.
[01:21:17] So 1003 was the baseline operational plan and then the letters on the end are how many,
[01:21:24] um, how many different right.
[01:21:26] So it got down to Victor.
[01:21:27] So 1003 Victor was the plan while I left and all the heavy lift aircraft started leaving
[01:21:31] Afghanistan when I was there.
[01:21:33] And I'm like, there's only so much heavy lift aircraft.
[01:21:36] I go, Oh my gosh, they're going to do 1003 Victor.
[01:21:40] So me coming back, I don't know exactly the periodicity when that they actually invasion
[01:21:45] kicked off, but I knew it was going to happen because of the heavy lift aircraft.
[01:21:51] So you know, I'm a platoon chief and I want to go to war with my dudes.
[01:21:56] I mean, I, there's one of these books written by Dick couch that they interviewed us when
[01:22:02] I was teaching land warfare.
[01:22:04] And in that book, I'm like, he's like, what do you want to do?
[01:22:07] Essentially, I'm like, my goal is to become a platoon chief.
[01:22:09] Like that's it.
[01:22:10] That to me, that's a pinnacle of a enlisted sales job has been opportunity.
[01:22:15] I was a troop chief later, but that was, you know, the thing.
[01:22:19] And then we wind up, they, they get this mission, this mission set protecting these
[01:22:23] Iraqi dignitaries.
[01:22:24] And I'm like, Oh man.
[01:22:28] So I mean, not that it's not important, but the war was not going well at the time.
[01:22:34] And again, I said this earlier, but that mission is declassified in 2009.
[01:22:38] So the top six Iraqi officials were protected by seal patents.
[01:22:42] Then it's kind of cool.
[01:22:45] They randomly assigned NFL football teams names.
[01:22:48] That was your, your call sign.
[01:22:51] Guess what mine was?
[01:22:52] No idea.
[01:22:53] Packers from Wisconsin.
[01:22:54] I'm like, this dude might live, man.
[01:22:56] Like, whoa.
[01:22:57] So, um, yeah, we protected a guy.
[01:23:00] He was a deputy vice president named Ibrahim al-Jafri.
[01:23:02] He was a family physician at six kids, uh, fled Saddam, lived in Iran, went up in London.
[01:23:08] And, um, it was, it was really, it was amazingly, uh, interesting to do that mission.
[01:23:17] And all the bros are out down.
[01:23:19] You guys are doing your gig, you know, and, um, I was essentially, I went to every place
[01:23:25] in that country running protection for a guy that's running a political campaign during
[01:23:31] a war where everybody wants to kill you.
[01:23:33] Yeah.
[01:23:34] I know.
[01:23:35] It was a miracle.
[01:23:36] Not just a miracle.
[01:23:37] It was a great, great, awesome work by the guys to keep all those guys safe.
[01:23:41] I mean, there was, everybody wanted all the, well, not everybody, but a big number of people
[01:23:48] wanted to kill one or any one of those people.
[01:23:53] And that leadership was kept alive for how long was that mission?
[01:23:57] Cause you said I was out doing, I wasn't doing anything at that point.
[01:24:00] I'd come back, you know, I really, you know, my timing was really, really good because
[01:24:05] I was, went up to just DA's for my first deployment, which was just awesome.
[01:24:11] As we left that mission came up.
[01:24:14] And then when I came back, it was over.
[01:24:16] So I had awesome timing as far as not having to do that mission.
[01:24:20] It lasted through, I mean, I came back after the elections.
[01:24:25] So again, the forest comp thing, remember everybody's fingers?
[01:24:28] Yeah.
[01:24:29] All right.
[01:24:30] So there's a picture of this guy who became the first democratic elected prime minister
[01:24:32] in Iraq's history.
[01:24:33] Right.
[01:24:34] And then there's a picture of him with his finger up there.
[01:24:36] I'm standing directly behind the camera that took that picture because I was responsible
[01:24:42] for his security.
[01:24:44] So back to Chris, man.
[01:24:46] So he's coming in and Bliff is there and we're rotating out, right?
[01:24:50] And two really funny things happened with him.
[01:24:52] One it's a prestige thing.
[01:24:54] So wait, so he's coming in with team seven or who's he coming in with?
[01:24:59] Your team five must have been.
[01:25:00] Yeah.
[01:25:01] I don't know who it was.
[01:25:02] It was Chief and cool and bliff was is I see, you know, and so two funny things happen.
[01:25:07] There's a cultural thing in some Arabic countries, Iraq being one where you want to be as close
[01:25:15] to the center of power as possible.
[01:25:16] I guess that's here in the United States too.
[01:25:18] But so we would run these motor kids, right?
[01:25:24] Lead limo file.
[01:25:25] And then you'd have elements ahead of you and then behind you.
[01:25:30] So if anything happened, you can skedaddle and these guys get in the gunfight.
[01:25:33] So you're protecting the principal.
[01:25:35] And I talked to these guys over and over again.
[01:25:37] I'm like, look, you're very important people.
[01:25:40] I get that.
[01:25:41] You know, you're the minister of whatever the heck, but our sole function is to make
[01:25:46] sure that echo lives.
[01:25:48] You know what I mean?
[01:25:49] We're going to help you with everyone medical, but that will not be to the detriment of making
[01:25:55] sure that echoes a lot.
[01:25:56] Check.
[01:25:57] We always try to weasel into this convoy and these guys had one of those beautiful Mercedes
[01:26:03] bands like the powder blue.
[01:26:05] You know, I'm talking to the big just awesome.
[01:26:08] And the guy's name was Adnan Phil.
[01:26:10] He was his security chief.
[01:26:12] Phil Phil is Arabic for pepper because he had a real hot temper, you know, and Chris
[01:26:18] is in the car with and we're sitting there, you know, blazing through Baghdad and looking
[01:26:25] them here.
[01:26:26] And it's interesting when you're in combat, you get to that point where you see everything.
[01:26:31] Do you know what I mean?
[01:26:32] Like things are happening over here and you have a full holistic understanding of your
[01:26:37] environment.
[01:26:38] And that's really why I think people miss being in that, you know, in combat because
[01:26:43] you are completely alive.
[01:26:45] Anyway, so I'm talking to them like, Oh my gosh, I want to suck this guy's weasel behind
[01:26:49] us in this powder blue Mercedes.
[01:26:51] It's on that Phil Phil.
[01:26:52] So I just opened up my door like this, this up armor, and I point my M4 back at them.
[01:26:59] I mean, clearly, I'm not going to shoot him.
[01:27:00] But I point my M4 at him.
[01:27:03] He's like, it goes back to the back of the line of this, you know, huge motor game.
[01:27:07] And Chris was like, what just happened?
[01:27:09] He actually used some of the expletives.
[01:27:11] And I'm like, I'm trying to tell you, these people are going to keep doing that.
[01:27:14] They're on our side.
[01:27:16] But it's very important that they understand the ground rules that are being set here.
[01:27:22] And that's going to happen over and over again.
[01:27:23] Chris, doesn't matter how hard you try, they're going to keep doing this.
[01:27:27] And then the other thing was funny, we're down at, do you remember who Tarek Aziz was?
[01:27:32] I remember that name.
[01:27:33] Saddam Hussein's foreign minister, the guy with the big sunglasses.
[01:27:36] Okay, so his house was taken over by a guy named Abdul Aziz Hakim, who was part of the
[01:27:42] Dawa party and was right by the, you exited the green zone, went over the 14th July branch
[01:27:48] and it's like right there.
[01:27:50] So that's where all these meetings are taking place.
[01:27:51] So we had to go down there.
[01:27:53] They only take the AIC, which is the agent in charge.
[01:27:55] It was the renamed OIC.
[01:27:58] They take him inside.
[01:27:59] They didn't want anybody else there.
[01:28:00] So we've got all these cars around.
[01:28:02] And I have my car and my body armor's in there, my helmets in there, my rifles in there, and
[01:28:07] I have a pistol.
[01:28:09] And we'd set up everywhere and you'd be there for hours and hours and hours.
[01:28:12] So I'd go around checking everybody.
[01:28:13] It was good to go.
[01:28:15] I'm in Chris and Bliss car.
[01:28:20] And I'm like, okay, so if we have an indirect attack, mortar, artillery, whatever, you just
[01:28:26] got to wait a minute and see if it develops into a complex attack.
[01:28:30] Meaning, so they mortar stuff and then they can use that to make everybody go to ground
[01:28:35] and then they can start infiltrating, you know, with ground troops.
[01:28:39] So I go, so if that happens and you just wait a sec and then you punch out a primary immediately
[01:28:45] so that no one can infiltrate your lines.
[01:28:46] And you got to just, you got to do it like boom, this happens.
[01:28:49] So and I open up the door, I hop out and boom, like right over there.
[01:28:54] Huge explosion.
[01:28:55] I go just like this.
[01:28:56] And I sit back in the car.
[01:28:57] Seriously, I said just like this and I sit back in the car.
[01:28:59] Wait a minute.
[01:29:00] Okay, go.
[01:29:01] And then I realized I don't have a rifle.
[01:29:03] I have my pistol.
[01:29:04] So you remember that little, the green army man, the medic running with the pistol.
[01:29:09] So I'm running in Baghdad with the pistol.
[01:29:12] I started, wait, where was your freaking weapon, bro?
[01:29:15] It was in my vehicle, which was right next to theirs, like right there.
[01:29:21] Oh, so you went over to tell them what to do.
[01:29:24] I was going in, I was briefing them about how to handle different attack scenarios.
[01:29:27] In that one time you did.
[01:29:29] The one time, you know, that happens.
[01:29:31] That's freaking awful.
[01:29:32] And so I'm like, you know, running to a perimeter with the pistol in my hand.
[01:29:36] I start chuckling because I'm like, I just look absurd at this point, but I'm a very
[01:29:40] good pistol shop, by the way.
[01:29:42] And what, what it turned out, that ain't going to cut it, bro.
[01:29:46] No, seriously.
[01:29:48] I know.
[01:29:49] Hey, listen, I think we should discuss things, words and all, you know, but what happened
[01:29:54] was the Iraqi police had had an AD with an RPG.
[01:29:59] So that was not an impact that was an outgoing, but they had that moon dust out there.
[01:30:05] You know, so you couldn't tell it looked like a mortar around coming.
[01:30:07] It didn't sound like a mortar around, but it looked like one because the impact.
[01:30:12] So that's my funny seal story.
[01:30:15] What did you learn from a leadership perspective on that deployment?
[01:30:18] That's a tough deployment from a different angle because you got guys that are pissed
[01:30:23] to be doing this job, but it's a very, it's a strategic mission to keep these guys alive.
[01:30:30] I learned, well, I didn't really learn it.
[01:30:32] It's just reinforced some things for me.
[01:30:35] The mission always comes first, no matter what.
[01:30:40] And the missions America.
[01:30:41] It's not some this woke bullshit that these military officers are coming up with now.
[01:30:45] Sorry for swearing, but that, that ain't the mission dude.
[01:30:48] The mission's America and that's got to happen every day.
[01:30:53] That's why, you know, my fat bald person, I'm running for Congress now because the mission
[01:30:57] is America and America is being failed by our leadership.
[01:31:00] Anyway, side note.
[01:31:02] So mission comes first.
[01:31:03] And then I also learned to let some things roll.
[01:31:09] And this is why.
[01:31:11] We were late.
[01:31:12] So the doctor lived in the Coticea, which was like a neighborhood right outside of checkpoint
[01:31:17] 11.
[01:31:18] So checkpoint 11 went from the green zone to route Irish where everybody's getting killed
[01:31:20] all the time.
[01:31:21] You had to drive down a mile or so, whatever.
[01:31:24] But no left into the Coticea to pick this guy up.
[01:31:27] And so we were late.
[01:31:29] I'm like, you know, frick, frack, frack, brr, you know, being a sealed sailor guy.
[01:31:33] We're living in Udey Hussein's, one of his joints.
[01:31:36] I think it was gray wolf was the father there.
[01:31:38] Anyway, so we're late and then boom, just massive, massive car bomb goes off right at
[01:31:47] checkpoint 11.
[01:31:48] Like it was so big it blew a car like 50 feet up on top of a tree.
[01:31:54] And here's what happened.
[01:31:56] They knew we were going to the Coticea and this they had this huge bomb and the traffic
[01:32:01] keeps going forward and forward and forward and forward.
[01:32:04] It finally gets to the checkpoint and they clack themselves off.
[01:32:07] We were supposed to be in that line passing and would have killed the entire platoon
[01:32:12] except for the one guy we had working on the job.
[01:32:15] So that was a real lesson.
[01:32:17] Yeah, should you strive to be on time?
[01:32:21] Sure.
[01:32:22] But you need to make sure that if things are going a little hinky, try to figure out why.
[01:32:28] I used to have, you know, my thing was my joke was, but it wasn't a joke, but it kind
[01:32:34] of was, you know, you have no go criteria.
[01:32:37] Yeah.
[01:32:38] Hey, we don't have the aircraft cover we want.
[01:32:39] That's no go or we don't have enough vehicles.
[01:32:42] And I used to joke, but I would serious.
[01:32:44] I'd be like, no, it's we have in my task, we have go, go criteria, which is we're going
[01:32:49] and we don't have aircraft.
[01:32:50] We'll call tanks.
[01:32:53] But occasionally, even with that attitude, I'd be like, well, okay, we don't have this.
[01:32:57] We don't have that.
[01:32:58] We, you know, this isn't working out.
[01:33:00] We haven't talked to these people and I'd be like the universe is conspiring against
[01:33:04] this operation and we're not going to do it.
[01:33:06] So it's just like a gut feeling where I'd like, I can, there's, I'll cover obstacle,
[01:33:11] obstacle, obstacle, obstacle, no factor, no factor, no factor, no factor, no factor.
[01:33:15] This, this is, this is, we're not doing this.
[01:33:19] Well that's a function of maturity.
[01:33:21] It really is.
[01:33:23] And sometimes you just look at things and you're like non-starter.
[01:33:26] Yeah.
[01:33:27] Yeah.
[01:33:28] And that's okay.
[01:33:30] So you get done with this deployment.
[01:33:34] In Iraq.
[01:33:35] In Iraq.
[01:33:36] And what's your next move?
[01:33:37] So that's your platoon chief deployment.
[01:33:39] You get done with that deployment.
[01:33:41] What's your next move?
[01:33:42] I came back and I'm a plank owner at what was known as the support activities.
[01:33:45] Support activities.
[01:33:47] So you're going there and the support activity basic mission is to gather intelligence.
[01:33:53] Yeah.
[01:33:54] It's like a combination of all the ints.
[01:33:56] And you know, I just had an act for that too.
[01:34:00] So I was one of the first five guys, you know, sitting around trying to figure this out.
[01:34:05] Bob Newsom was the first skipper.
[01:34:08] He's retired cap nine.
[01:34:09] Worked for the 76ers doing some stuff.
[01:34:11] No idea.
[01:34:12] Yeah.
[01:34:13] But um, yeah, that was a very, very rewarding time to build something else up from the ground
[01:34:21] because I only built or helped build, you know, this is not clearly, this is all a team
[01:34:27] effort, but help build the special connoisseurs and warfare part of trade at.
[01:34:33] And then doing that, it's like the whole team, which was, which was fascinating.
[01:34:39] And then I did some deployments from that that are not really a topic for discussion.
[01:34:42] Right.
[01:34:43] And how, but how long did you spend there?
[01:34:45] Oh my gosh.
[01:34:47] Like three years.
[01:34:48] It couldn't have been that long actually.
[01:34:50] Well I came back from Iraq and then that was, would have been 2005 or six.
[01:34:57] I think I left there in 2008 ish.
[01:35:01] It's like two or three years.
[01:35:03] I went to special operations command Europe after that.
[01:35:08] After that, but then you go to seven first.
[01:35:10] So, yeah, sorry.
[01:35:12] Cause you, cause I know that's when you and I really, that's when you and I crossed that.
[01:35:15] I think we'd met each other along the way at some point, but we, I didn't actually say
[01:35:20] one, right.
[01:35:22] Until I was at trade at, and you were at team seven.
[01:35:27] So I went from, you're right.
[01:35:28] It was sport activity team seven special operations command Europe.
[01:35:32] And then I retired out of since you'll swig.
[01:35:34] So okay.
[01:35:35] So you do, you're doing working with the ints and by what you mean by that is human intelligence,
[01:35:42] signal intelligence, all that kind of intelligence gathering.
[01:35:45] We'll say you did that for a few years.
[01:35:47] I'm not going to talk about that here.
[01:35:50] And then you go, what third, you want to see something called keep talking.
[01:35:53] Okay.
[01:35:54] Well, you're breaking stuff up.
[01:35:55] I'll show you.
[01:35:56] I want to show you one of the coolest pictures ever.
[01:35:58] Oh, okay.
[01:35:59] Because this was on my last deployment for Afghanistan.
[01:36:05] Check that one out.
[01:36:09] That's a winner.
[01:36:14] That picture is taken about three or four months after the boat scene on active valor
[01:36:18] was filmed.
[01:36:20] The boat scene on active hours filmed.
[01:36:22] So active hours, a movie with a bunch of seals in it.
[01:36:24] Right.
[01:36:25] I'm in the movie.
[01:36:26] When was that filmed?
[01:36:27] Gosh, it was.
[01:36:28] That wasn't that wasn't until later.
[01:36:31] It came out in 2012 or something, but that it took like three years to film that movie
[01:36:36] because everybody except for the officer in the film deployed to combat during the filming
[01:36:41] of that movie.
[01:36:42] What happens if someone gets killed?
[01:36:43] It's going to wreck the movie.
[01:36:44] You're like, well, thanks deeply appreciate your caring about us.
[01:36:47] You're going to have to rewrite a script that will take you eight minutes because there
[01:36:50] was no script.
[01:36:52] Yeah, that was, uh, I think it came out 2012.
[01:36:55] So they started filming that in 2009 ish because I was, that was, I was working up to go to
[01:37:00] Afghanistan when that was filmed.
[01:37:02] And that got, so here's what happened with that movie.
[01:37:05] Let's, let's talk to seal team seven first.
[01:37:06] Okay.
[01:37:07] So you, this is a team seven.
[01:37:08] Right.
[01:37:09] So yeah.
[01:37:10] So check this out.
[01:37:11] So I am a troop chief at team seven.
[01:37:13] And then the super specialized mission came along that I had done previously and I'm the
[01:37:19] only one at the team that has done this.
[01:37:21] And I'm the only one with the qualifications while there's two other guys with the same
[01:37:24] qualifications as me, but I'm the only one that has actually done this mission working
[01:37:27] for this other subset of people doing this stuff.
[01:37:30] So the skipper's like, I don't know what I'm doing.
[01:37:32] I mean, God bless him.
[01:37:34] He had no idea.
[01:37:35] He goes, you can pick anybody you want from the team and take him to go do this.
[01:37:39] So me and the guy who I won't mention is actually right next to me in that picture because he's
[01:37:43] still after duty.
[01:37:45] We went through everybody's records at team seven.
[01:37:47] I'm like, you know, this guy, this guy, this guy, this guy, and then we need comms guys
[01:37:51] and all these other folks.
[01:37:52] So we put together this little group of folks to deploy to Afghanistan to do this super
[01:37:56] specialized mission.
[01:37:57] That was at team seven.
[01:37:59] So I went from being a troop chief.
[01:38:01] We had 56 or 60 years after that was after you did your troop chief.
[01:38:06] That was my troop chief deployment.
[01:38:09] So we sent guys to Balad.
[01:38:13] Iraq was not happening.
[01:38:14] They're wearing starch uniforms and they have no magazines in their guns.
[01:38:18] The Walker and saluting people in Iraq.
[01:38:19] I don't want any part of that.
[01:38:22] And then there was a small group that went to Afghanistan to get reattached to the CG
[01:38:28] Soda for the first time since Red Wings happened.
[01:38:31] And then I took another group of guys over here.
[01:38:34] So my guys got farmed to Balad to do nothing.
[01:38:38] A small group of them that's declassified now to Yemen.
[01:38:41] And then we went to Afghanistan to do this other subset.
[01:38:45] So we didn't have a traditional, you know, task unit, go out and, you know, like bruiser.
[01:38:50] We didn't, it just wasn't available.
[01:38:52] Yeah.
[01:38:53] It just wasn't happening.
[01:38:54] No, it wasn't.
[01:38:55] So I went and did that.
[01:38:56] How'd you like being a troop chief?
[01:38:57] You know what?
[01:39:00] It was interesting, but it's not, it's not, it wasn't like his hands on.
[01:39:08] The logistics part was, you know, it was more difficult to get done.
[01:39:14] And then you're managing personalities.
[01:39:20] You know, I could, I would prefer to do this.
[01:39:23] Yeah.
[01:39:24] I mean, I guess if your, your troop gets all split up, yeah, I mean, if we had a traditional
[01:39:29] true or traditional, you know, air quotations, you know, 0506 Iraq or if we could do like
[01:39:35] 03 Afghanistan, where you are seriously getting it, that would have been much different.
[01:39:44] But in effect, you know, I had guys, like one of my guys, I'll give you an example of
[01:39:50] why, one of my guys, I think I had six seals with me.
[01:39:54] So going from like 60 seals to six, but they're all like, you know what?
[01:39:58] We were doing that, like driving around in thin skin vehicles by ourselves during the
[01:40:04] day in Afghanistan.
[01:40:07] And your QRF is not coming.
[01:40:09] So the level of stress that is applied, I mean, it's so much easier.
[01:40:15] And you know this to go with 50 dudes and lock something down and go in and just, you know,
[01:40:19] do seal stuff.
[01:40:21] And that's great.
[01:40:22] And it, you know, we get a lot of, it's very stressful.
[01:40:25] That's really stressful.
[01:40:27] When you got to plan these things in detail, intricate, and if you make one mistake, it's
[01:40:31] over.
[01:40:32] And I did that for several years.
[01:40:35] I mean, it's upper division warfare is what I call it.
[01:40:39] Upper division warfare.
[01:40:40] Yeah, it is totally.
[01:40:41] Because you have to have a holistic understanding of all the thresholds going from the Elanthi
[01:40:47] electronic warfare perspective all the way down to how do I shoot my gun?
[01:40:51] Way different than, you know, go that way.
[01:40:56] So when you build this picture, you have, you have like a global perspective, but for
[01:41:05] a local area.
[01:41:08] And you understand you have all these triggers that if they start getting pinged, you got
[01:41:12] to bail.
[01:41:13] And sometimes you intentionally trigger them.
[01:41:17] So yeah, interesting.
[01:41:20] So that was troop to troop chief thing.
[01:41:23] In a way it was not as exciting as it should have been.
[01:41:26] But again, that's the first place.
[01:41:28] Like I said, that's the first time that I like remember you PIDing like, oh yeah, that's
[01:41:32] because you know, I'd seen you around and you were an essay, whatever.
[01:41:35] But that's the first time I remember you.
[01:41:37] Like we were out at desert training and like meeting you and hanging out and running the
[01:41:44] FTX's and all that stuff, having good times.
[01:41:49] Carrying some, you were carrying some, you know, some wounded men out there, which seems
[01:41:57] to have left a mark on some people emotionally at this juncture.
[01:42:01] I was a little bit crazy when it came back.
[01:42:03] So.
[01:42:04] All right, man.
[01:42:05] Hey, listen, I got it.
[01:42:06] I'll tell you something.
[01:42:07] I remember your, your viewers understands.
[01:42:09] I remember when you came back and you went around the teams and you gave a brief that
[01:42:14] you called the pressure.
[01:42:16] Remember that?
[01:42:17] Yeah.
[01:42:18] The pressure.
[01:42:19] And at that point, because I didn't know you either.
[01:42:21] You know what I mean?
[01:42:22] You got some dude, bad haircut, probably lifts too many weights and drinks, energy drinks,
[01:42:28] you know, whatever.
[01:42:29] It's a total diamond doesn't seal.
[01:42:31] This is just to be honest.
[01:42:32] It's good to be the diamond in the rough.
[01:42:35] But you gave this brief and it was, you called it the pressure and it was, what you're doing
[01:42:40] is you're conveying.
[01:42:41] I mean, this is my perspective.
[01:42:42] Obviously you wrote it.
[01:42:45] Conveying the burden of leadership and the fact that you truly at that point got it, which
[01:42:51] is a lot of officers never get it.
[01:42:55] And I was watching you and I thought you were much younger than me at the time.
[01:42:58] I don't know.
[01:42:59] But I was like, this guy gets it.
[01:43:00] Like he understands ramifications of poor decision making and things are real.
[01:43:08] And it just doesn't affect, you know, your reputation as I'm a great operator, you know,
[01:43:14] that it affects families and that it affects the nation.
[01:43:19] And I understood that.
[01:43:20] That's when I really got a respect for you.
[01:43:21] When listening to you see that, because I could see your heart was breaking when you're discussing
[01:43:25] this and that you weren't making anything up.
[01:43:28] Being very genuine about leadership is really important and we're missing that, dude.
[01:43:32] We're missing that from the tactical, strategic and operational level throughout our country
[01:43:37] and private industry and the government, especially it's terrible.
[01:43:41] So now you guys know.
[01:43:43] Yeah, I haven't given that brief in a long time.
[01:43:49] And I remember thinking about it and, you know, I'm thinking about the experiences that
[01:43:57] I had, you know, when we deployed in Tasking a Bruiser, you know, we hadn't lost any guys
[01:44:04] on the West Coast yet.
[01:44:06] And you know, even looking into, you know, we were just talking about the work up and
[01:44:11] you're going through the work up and like a down man was like a theoretical thing, a
[01:44:17] problem solving event that you're going to get and you're going to go through it.
[01:44:20] And OK, now that person gets, you know, you're back to life at the end of that training mission.
[01:44:24] And obviously that's not the reality of the situation.
[01:44:28] Correct.
[01:44:29] And trying to make sure to convey that to the guys.
[01:44:31] And that's, you know, when I got done with that deployment, you know, the admiral who
[01:44:37] I knew was like, where do you want to go?
[01:44:40] And I 100% just said I want to go to trade at, I want to go to trade at and run training.
[01:44:45] And the reason is because first of all, all the guys in my task in it were all going to
[01:44:49] go right back into another platoon.
[01:44:52] And they were all going to go right back overseas into that meat grinder.
[01:44:55] And it didn't look like, you know, this was in 2006 when we got home, it was still, you
[01:44:58] couldn't tell when it was going to stop.
[01:45:01] It just looked like it was going to go on indefinitely.
[01:45:03] We saw some indications that looking in hindsight, you could see that, oh, that was an indication
[01:45:10] that things were going to settle down.
[01:45:11] But you couldn't positively identify them at the time coming home from deployment.
[01:45:14] I was like, no, this is going to last.
[01:45:16] We're going to have to do this in all these other cities.
[01:45:18] It's just going to continue.
[01:45:19] And everyone's going back to this meat grinder, and I want to make sure that I can convey
[01:45:23] these lessons to the guys that are going to go back over there and get in it.
[01:45:27] And that's where that came from.
[01:45:31] So you went to trade at for the same reasons I did, but six years later.
[01:45:35] Yeah.
[01:45:36] Yeah.
[01:45:37] It was to pass on those lessons and get things headed in the right direction.
[01:45:41] Increase combat survivability of SEALs.
[01:45:44] 100%.
[01:45:45] And that's why we're out at Nyland or we're out at the urban training sites.
[01:45:51] And it was like, I remember feeling I'd see a guy in an urban environment standing in
[01:45:57] the middle of the street, and I would literally have a sick to my stomach knot when I'd see
[01:46:03] a guy standing in the open.
[01:46:04] This is in training.
[01:46:05] And I'd get over to be like, go find cover because you're waiting for the guy to get
[01:46:11] shot.
[01:46:12] That's a horrible feeling.
[01:46:13] And doing the best to pass those lessons on that's, you know, that was the goal.
[01:46:18] Yeah.
[01:46:20] That should be everybody's goal.
[01:46:22] It's I when you take that and you transition into civilian life.
[01:46:30] I tell people a couple of things frequently.
[01:46:33] It is the minimum responsibility of every American citizen to pass on to their children
[01:46:36] or country where they have at a minimum the same ability to choose to have options.
[01:46:44] And we're failing at that as a society collectively.
[01:46:48] If you think about what the government did to the population during this COVID crap,
[01:46:56] you can't deny there's five elements to the First Amendment.
[01:46:59] There's freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly
[01:47:03] and freedom to seek a regress redress for grievances.
[01:47:07] All of those are smashed in the ground during COVID.
[01:47:10] So it's our responsibility to make sure that doesn't happen again.
[01:47:13] How do we do that?
[01:47:14] We take the imperative knowledge from what we went through these last two years and we
[01:47:16] apply that innacadly, meaning we don't try to read into it.
[01:47:21] We just look at it and say what it is and the government now is trying to hide everything.
[01:47:24] They're trying to do everything back.
[01:47:25] Yeah, which is one of the worst things possible.
[01:47:27] When you make a mistake, you know, you go, hey, look, I'm in a state here.
[01:47:31] And this was horrible during the whole thing because, hey, if you think that this thing
[01:47:36] spreads this way and you look up three months later and that turns out to not be true, you
[01:47:41] say, hey, listen, I made a mistake here.
[01:47:43] We thought it was this.
[01:47:44] It was that.
[01:47:45] Here's the adjustment.
[01:47:46] You know, I would send you out on operation and say, hey, you know, I want you to hit
[01:47:49] this target from the north and you go, okay, okay, boss sounds good.
[01:47:52] And you hit a couple IEDs on the way in and you go, hey, Jocko, there's IEDs here.
[01:47:56] I don't go, well, you just keep going where I told you to go.
[01:47:59] No, I say, hey, look, I made a mistake on the analysis of the scenario.
[01:48:03] Back out.
[01:48:04] Let's figure out a better way.
[01:48:05] No factor.
[01:48:06] And by the way, you're not, you don't lose respect for me.
[01:48:09] You go, oh, well, Jocko was willing to admit that he made a mistake of the analysis of this
[01:48:13] and learned from it and learned from it.
[01:48:15] And now we're going to make some adjustments and to see the egos come out where there's
[01:48:19] no admission that, hey, you know what, I actually, I made a bad assessment here.
[01:48:24] It was wrong.
[01:48:25] And here's the adjustment we need to make as far as I can tell right now.
[01:48:29] And by the way, there's a decent chance we'll be wrong again, which also is why I'm not
[01:48:32] over committing and overstating things.
[01:48:36] You know, I always have fun when I work with companies and I'll say, how often do you,
[01:48:41] you know, how often do you people think I have to admit that I'm wrong?
[01:48:44] And people think, oh, you know, because I talk about being humble and they go, oh, you admit
[01:48:48] that you're wrong all the time.
[01:48:49] And I go, no, I hardly ever have to admit that I'm wrong.
[01:48:51] And the reason I hardly ever have to admit that I'm wrong is because I hardly ever say,
[01:48:53] I'm 100% right about this thing.
[01:48:57] This is how we should do this mission or this is what this means or this is how you should
[01:49:00] interpret this.
[01:49:01] No, I say, hey, this is what it looks like from my perspective.
[01:49:05] Let's take a small step and see what we learn.
[01:49:07] So I agree with it mostly there, but it's to me, it's not, this is how I think we should
[01:49:13] do this.
[01:49:14] That's okay.
[01:49:15] When people, and this was one of the things that we had to break when we were writing
[01:49:19] all that curriculum for SR and Lane warfare, this is how this is done.
[01:49:26] When you say to somebody, this is how this is done, you're over because this is how this
[01:49:33] was done at this time in this place with this series of variables.
[01:49:38] Yeah.
[01:49:39] Well, so you actually agree with what I said, because what I said is, well, what I'm saying
[01:49:44] is, hey, this is what I think we should do right now.
[01:49:47] Not this is what we should do.
[01:49:49] Yes.
[01:49:50] This is what I think we should do right now.
[01:49:51] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is, this is not what, okay, there's a difference.
[01:49:55] So this is what we should do is different than this is how this is done.
[01:49:59] So this is what we should do.
[01:50:01] Means that this is the way that I think at this particular time, this should be done
[01:50:05] right because of these variables.
[01:50:07] It's open.
[01:50:08] It's open.
[01:50:09] This is how this is done is closed is wrong.
[01:50:11] Yeah.
[01:50:12] Decision making is not taking place.
[01:50:14] Yeah.
[01:50:15] So that's why I hardly ever have to admit that I'm wrong because I hardly ever say, hey,
[01:50:20] I'm 100% right about this thing right here.
[01:50:22] No, you're not going to catch me saying that.
[01:50:24] Because how often can you be accurate with that?
[01:50:26] It's very, very seldom that you're going to be in a scenario where you know something
[01:50:31] with 100% certainty.
[01:50:33] It almost never happens.
[01:50:34] And I would rather, even if I'm 99% certain, what do I gain out of imposing some directive
[01:50:42] on you?
[01:50:43] If you're working for me, what am I going to gain out of that?
[01:50:45] You got your perspective.
[01:50:46] There's a decent chance that you see something I don't see.
[01:50:49] So my mind's open.
[01:50:50] Hey, Derek, I think Mike, this might be a good way to do this op.
[01:50:53] Then you go, well, I don't agree.
[01:50:55] Okay, well, what do you think?
[01:50:57] Let's talk.
[01:50:58] And my gut, my bias is to go with what you say.
[01:51:03] That is my bias is to, you come up with a way to do something.
[01:51:07] It doesn't matter if I'm, here's the other interesting thing.
[01:51:09] It doesn't matter if we're peers or I'm your boss or you're my boss.
[01:51:13] My bias is to go with what you say.
[01:51:15] Now look, if you're totally off the res and your idea is just ridiculous, well, it's
[01:51:22] very easy for me to articulate, Hey, Derek, I know you want to do this, you know, jumping
[01:51:26] parachutes out of the space shuttle, but right, it's going to be really hard for us to get
[01:51:29] the space shuttle for this operation in a short period of time.
[01:51:33] So I thought you're wheeling heat.
[01:51:34] Exactly.
[01:51:36] It's very easy to articulate that.
[01:51:37] But if I'm having a hard time articulating why I think something should be done a certain
[01:51:43] way, then that's a big indicator that maybe it's not worth arguing.
[01:51:47] And maybe it's just easier to say, Okay, you know what, Derek, let's let's let's roll
[01:51:50] with your dice.
[01:51:51] You're incapable of articulating appropriately the methodologies that you're applying to
[01:51:56] a problem set.
[01:51:57] You have not thought them through well enough.
[01:51:58] Boom.
[01:51:59] Yeah.
[01:52:00] Someone taught a seal how to read.
[01:52:01] What's up?
[01:52:02] It's a real good indicator of that.
[01:52:07] So you roll out on this deployment, you're doing some, what'd you say, higher level?
[01:52:13] What'd you say?
[01:52:14] What was your vision warfare division warfare running around without a ton of support.
[01:52:21] Correct.
[01:52:22] If any, and you get done with that deployment won't go into the details of that one.
[01:52:29] You come back.
[01:52:30] What's your next job?
[01:52:31] Okay, I was going to go teach what I was doing because I believe you should do that.
[01:52:36] Right.
[01:52:37] Like we talked about that.
[01:52:38] But then they came, so I was a senior chief at that point and the billet, the job was
[01:52:44] for an E seven, not an E eight.
[01:52:46] And that's when they went through and they said, Hey, look, you used to be able to do
[01:52:49] one up, one down.
[01:52:50] So the billet is for an E seven and E six could go do that or a E eight.
[01:52:56] Right.
[01:52:57] You could do one up, one down.
[01:52:58] They're like, no more of this.
[01:52:59] We don't have enough guys to do this stuff.
[01:53:00] It's an E seven billet.
[01:53:01] So I'm like, Oh man.
[01:53:03] So I go check in is down at the elephant cage at advanced training and I was just kind of
[01:53:08] sitting there and they're like, we got to find it E seven billet, you know, and there
[01:53:12] was not because that's a platoon chief job and I just got done being a troop chief nerd,
[01:53:16] you know.
[01:53:17] And suddenly I go up to more calm, it's like a month into this and I feel like I'm stealing
[01:53:21] money from the government because I go to check in.
[01:53:24] We got nothing to do.
[01:53:25] And so I go up to Pugs is the guy and Pugs, right?
[01:53:33] So I'm like, Pugs, dude, I needed a job.
[01:53:37] And he's like, well, I don't know.
[01:53:38] So he pulls up the list of like all the seal billets on the planet, right?
[01:53:43] And Bosnia, I flew through Germany, Stuttgart, Booblingen, on the way there and on the way
[01:53:50] back.
[01:53:51] And I'm like, and my wife, she did like a semester in Germany in college.
[01:53:58] So I'm like, right there.
[01:54:00] I want to go there.
[01:54:01] He's like, okay.
[01:54:02] So I get a billet.
[01:54:05] I get a billet as the J three five, which is the contingency operations, NCIC at special
[01:54:09] operations command Europe.
[01:54:12] That's why I went up there.
[01:54:14] Yeah.
[01:54:15] And, you know, I have an act for this stuff.
[01:54:17] The upper division warfare stuff applies.
[01:54:18] I understand how to, you know, take very complex problem sets and distill them down into readily
[01:54:27] available and achievable solutions.
[01:54:29] Like it's just something I'm good at.
[01:54:32] And so I wrote all the contingency of the soft response to contingency operations plans
[01:54:36] for all the countries in Europe.
[01:54:38] And then we developed further.
[01:54:40] From them being executed right now, I'm sure.
[01:54:42] Yeah.
[01:54:43] The, um, convention warfare campaign plan for the Ukraine is one of them.
[01:54:47] So at that time when I left in 2012, me and this other guy named Derek, who's a retired
[01:54:54] special forces girl, we gave the Ukrainians a month.
[01:54:58] Like so we were planning for a Russian invasion of the Ukraine in 2000.
[01:55:03] That's 2009 10.
[01:55:05] Right.
[01:55:06] People think the military doesn't do stuff.
[01:55:07] We do.
[01:55:09] But we gave him a month because the authorities are different.
[01:55:12] And what do you mean you gave him a month?
[01:55:14] We thought within a month, the Russians would take over the entire country.
[01:55:17] Oh, got it.
[01:55:18] Like we gave him a month.
[01:55:19] DoD, I think it was given him about a week.
[01:55:21] But you know, intuitively, Derek had multiple combat tours as special forces officers.
[01:55:25] It's the fantastic officer.
[01:55:29] But we gave him a month because we knew it better.
[01:55:31] And then they changed the authorities and this happened so you could give him javelins
[01:55:36] and stingers also the weapons that are doing this.
[01:55:42] The crux of the plan without getting real deep into it is disaggregated small unit operations
[01:55:48] facilitated by high tech weapons.
[01:55:50] That's it.
[01:55:51] And then also you have external intelligence and all that stuff.
[01:55:55] That's just taking place.
[01:55:56] That truly was an amazing thing.
[01:56:01] It was very intellectually stimulating to do that.
[01:56:04] But you know, at that point, I broke my back and all this stuff and I can't carry a rocket
[01:56:09] anymore.
[01:56:10] And that's really why I got out of the teams is because I just couldn't do the job physically.
[01:56:14] I didn't want to breath far of myself.
[01:56:16] You know what I mean?
[01:56:17] Which Brett should have just retired.
[01:56:18] Dude, Green Bay, why'd you go to Minnesota with Brett?
[01:56:21] I'm looking right into the camera.
[01:56:22] Why did you do that?
[01:56:25] So doing that really kept me engaged in what was taking place really at that point globally.
[01:56:33] And so Benghazi went down when I was there and there was still a sock half was getting
[01:56:38] stood up special operations command Africa.
[01:56:42] And there was commanders in extremist force sharing agreement.
[01:56:45] You know, so it was I was really very deeply involved in the aftermath of Benghazi and
[01:56:54] everything the Clinton folks told you and Obama is a lie.
[01:56:59] In terms of what?
[01:57:01] That should not have happened.
[01:57:03] And as it was happening, it should have been stopped and could have been stopped.
[01:57:08] Right.
[01:57:09] So I mean, background on that.
[01:57:12] Jimmy Carter, who previously was the worst president in American history, only superseded
[01:57:18] by the current one Joe Biden.
[01:57:19] He is terrible.
[01:57:20] He just is.
[01:57:21] It's very difficult to watch.
[01:57:23] It's terrible.
[01:57:24] I mean, it's painful.
[01:57:27] So Jimmy Carter did something called chief of mission authorities.
[01:57:30] An American ambassador is real title is chief of mission.
[01:57:34] So the chief of the diplomatic mission, that's the real title.
[01:57:37] And Carter said, look, no military forces will go into a country without the approval
[01:57:43] of the chief of mission unless it's a title 10 designated country.
[01:57:48] Meaning the title 10 is the Department of Defense thing.
[01:57:50] And we're like, hey, we're going to invade Iraq.
[01:57:52] That becomes a title 10 deal.
[01:57:53] The military can move troops back and forth into that country without going through the
[01:57:58] State Department.
[01:57:59] That was not the case for Libya.
[01:58:01] I mean, it wasn't.
[01:58:04] So the State Department has so Ambassador Stevens had to approve the troops that were
[01:58:10] on their way to Benghazi had to approve them landing in the country, but he was dead.
[01:58:16] And the State Department didn't answer the phone.
[01:58:20] Tina Cade now was there along with Secretary Clinton.
[01:58:23] She's ultimately responsible.
[01:58:24] They just didn't answer the phone.
[01:58:27] And birds were spinning up and there's a role.
[01:58:33] If you look up Jackal Stone 12, I think, just Google it.
[01:58:37] Jackal Stone is a special operations forces annual European exercise.
[01:58:44] You probably did it if you're two.
[01:58:45] Did you know?
[01:58:46] Okay.
[01:58:47] But I know, but I know what the exercises.
[01:58:49] Okay.
[01:58:50] So that was taking place in split Croatia.
[01:58:51] And you know that the SIF is there and they have a full pack.
[01:58:54] None of this is classified, by the way.
[01:58:56] They have a full package.
[01:58:58] They've got shooters, they got comms, they got medical, they have resupply, you know,
[01:59:03] water, everything.
[01:59:04] That bird was going there.
[01:59:06] Because that's why it's there.
[01:59:09] In case something like that happens and the agreement between Sokhaf and Sokjir was in
[01:59:14] place because Sokhaf didn't have a SIF yet.
[01:59:16] Yeah.
[01:59:17] Yeah.
[01:59:18] Right.
[01:59:19] So but no answer the phone.
[01:59:20] So you can't land that plane.
[01:59:25] Ty Woods man, did you know Ty?
[01:59:26] Yeah.
[01:59:27] Okay.
[01:59:28] He's a total friend of mine, man.
[01:59:29] And I didn't know Glenn.
[01:59:30] He was in my class.
[01:59:31] He was in my bus class.
[01:59:32] Ty Woods?
[01:59:33] Yep.
[01:59:34] Yep.
[01:59:35] And he ended up getting rolled.
[01:59:36] But you know, he spent, you know.
[01:59:39] Right.
[01:59:40] So shameful.
[01:59:41] And that I truly, I mean, I knew it before because I'd seen it on a macro level, but
[01:59:47] I hadn't really seen on a, excuse me, on a micro level.
[01:59:52] I've seen it, but on a macro level, I hadn't seen really the hardcore ramifications of
[01:59:57] incredibly poor decision making.
[01:59:58] Other than the fact we invaded Iraq when we did.
[02:00:01] I mean, that was a big thing.
[02:00:04] But that really, really brought it home that you just can't do that.
[02:00:10] You have to be, if you're in a position of leadership, your phone is on all the time.
[02:00:15] Yeah.
[02:00:16] Well, actually superior to that is when you're in a position of leadership, you set up decentralized
[02:00:19] command where people can make decisions without having to run things all the way up
[02:00:21] to the top.
[02:00:22] Yeah.
[02:00:23] That's what you do.
[02:00:24] That's the, yeah.
[02:00:25] I mean, that's, that's how things should function.
[02:00:29] Great on that depressing note.
[02:00:31] Yeah.
[02:00:32] So, so this is what you're doing.
[02:00:33] You get a really good look strategically at the world through this tour that you do
[02:00:39] right at soccer.
[02:00:40] You're in a J35 billet doing planning and contingency planning.
[02:00:44] And that's just a great view to go from being a troop commander literally on the ground.
[02:00:50] And then even as a troop commander being for this particular deployment at a more, even
[02:00:56] more tackle level than a normal troop command, but true.
[02:00:59] Correct.
[02:01:00] But doing a strategic level mission.
[02:01:02] Yes.
[02:01:03] And then, but you're on the ground doing it.
[02:01:05] Yeah.
[02:01:06] That's the difference.
[02:01:07] And then you get to go to a situation where you're seeing the strategic planning for these
[02:01:12] things that take place in the future.
[02:01:13] So there's a really good education for you.
[02:01:15] It's tremendous.
[02:01:17] And you do how many years over there?
[02:01:19] Oh, I did three years there.
[02:01:20] And how many kids do you got at this point?
[02:01:22] Four.
[02:01:23] Do you speak German at this point?
[02:01:25] Nine.
[02:01:26] Two of them graduated from high school there though.
[02:01:29] Oh, okay.
[02:01:30] But it's in American high school.
[02:01:31] It's in American high school.
[02:01:32] Yeah.
[02:01:33] Yeah, I just, one of my buddies ran into a team guy and his kids are all speaking German
[02:01:36] because he came back from there.
[02:01:37] Oh, I probably put him in the local schools.
[02:01:39] Which you can do.
[02:01:40] Yeah.
[02:01:41] Which I was not to.
[02:01:42] Check.
[02:01:43] You get done with that.
[02:01:44] What's your next job after that?
[02:01:45] Center for sealant, swick excellence.
[02:01:47] Which is the schoolhouse?
[02:01:49] No, that is the command that writes all the advancement exams for seals.
[02:01:55] That writes the enlisted ladder.
[02:01:57] People don't understand when you join the Navy, the Navy plans out a career for you
[02:02:02] for 30 years.
[02:02:04] So even though you think you're joining on a six year enlistment or eight years or whatever
[02:02:08] it is, you know, active and reserve, the Navy has a plan for you and they palm, I don't
[02:02:12] know what that stands for, but they budget for you being in the military for 30 years.
[02:02:17] But what, at least the seal teams have done, I don't know if other communities do this,
[02:02:21] but you backwards plan on that.
[02:02:23] So by the time you're in E5, you've gone to this school, you've done this job E6,
[02:02:27] 7, 8, it goes all the way up, that's the ladder to make sure that everybody is hopefully on
[02:02:32] par with their institutional knowledge.
[02:02:36] So I did that and it was really fun writing the advancement exams because I'd call all
[02:02:40] my buddies and be like, hey, will you go down to Florida with me for a week?
[02:02:44] We'll get locked in a skiff, you know, a big safe and we'll go through the previous exams
[02:02:49] and then we'll write new questions updating the TTPs and all of the things for the seal
[02:02:53] teams then in order to get promoted, seals would have to take that.
[02:02:57] So that was awesome too.
[02:02:58] That's a way to get back to the community.
[02:03:00] But I went there because I needed to like get my medical situation in order and it took
[02:03:08] like a year and a half.
[02:03:09] Because at this point you're just a beat up old frogman.
[02:03:13] You know what I mean?
[02:03:14] That's why I'm fat right now.
[02:03:15] If I go PT right now I can't walk.
[02:03:16] I mean I've got an anti-cat placard for my car.
[02:03:19] Damn.
[02:03:20] Yeah, damn.
[02:03:21] So I mean my knees and hips and back and I got a ricochet in the face.
[02:03:25] It was in training.
[02:03:26] It counts for nothing.
[02:03:27] I didn't even get a free dental appointment because of that.
[02:03:31] So yeah, I went there to do dual purpose, get myself physically up to par, at least
[02:03:38] documented appropriately.
[02:03:41] So that when I retired, because anyone's going to retire, you know it would be less of a
[02:03:45] burden.
[02:03:46] So that's really what I did there.
[02:03:48] And again, I've had the ability and the luck and I think I'm blessed man.
[02:03:54] I mean I am.
[02:03:55] I have a deep and abiding faith in God.
[02:03:57] And I look back, you know all the way back to getting hit in the head with a shackle.
[02:04:02] How that led to all this stuff.
[02:04:04] You know?
[02:04:05] There's, I am one of the luckiest human beings that has ever existed.
[02:04:11] And I am so full of gratitude man.
[02:04:12] I mean I just, I get up and I'm just full of gratitude.
[02:04:17] And I wish that more people would understand the gifts that they've been given.
[02:04:23] And understand they're a gift.
[02:04:25] I talked to folks about the cavalry thing.
[02:04:29] Like the cavalry's not coming over the hill.
[02:04:30] I tell them like, look man, you're placed here at this time, you know with these people
[02:04:36] in this circumstance by God.
[02:04:38] Like you're put here for a reason and from my perspective what I'm doing now and the
[02:04:44] people I'm speaking to, it's to save the greatest country that has ever existed in the history
[02:04:49] of the world.
[02:04:51] Like the United States of America is an exceptional nation and I don't tolerate anybody talking
[02:04:56] crap about America.
[02:04:57] It's not going to happen.
[02:04:58] And these folks that I'm dealing with, like you were placed here by God for that to save
[02:05:05] the United States of America and that's a gift and you got to accept the gift.
[02:05:10] And oftentimes gifts, you get this.
[02:05:14] Oftentimes gifts can be perceived as a burden.
[02:05:19] You know the gift of leadership that the talk used to give the pressure.
[02:05:22] You're in that place at that time with those people in that circumstance and these things
[02:05:26] happen you're exercising the best judgment that you're capable of doing.
[02:05:29] You have the best assets in the world.
[02:05:30] You're certainly working with the finest human beings that have ever existed and contextually
[02:05:35] in warfare for sure and then around the block you know.
[02:05:39] You're there for a reason because you were given the gift to be able to exercise that
[02:05:45] mission.
[02:05:46] If you're capable of doing something and you don't act on it, you're not giving glory
[02:05:52] to God.
[02:05:54] You're giving the intellectual or physical ability to do things.
[02:05:56] If you don't do them, you're falling short.
[02:06:00] I believe that.
[02:06:02] Other people need to understand that.
[02:06:07] What was it that made you decide that you were going to retire?
[02:06:10] You're at how many years was this?
[02:06:13] That was I would say 24 I guess.
[02:06:16] That's when you made the decision?
[02:06:18] Yeah.
[02:06:19] And I retired at 26.
[02:06:20] And how many kids did you have that was four?
[02:06:22] You were up to your four at this point.
[02:06:24] Yeah.
[02:06:25] I just I knew that I couldn't do the job to the level that it deserved.
[02:06:29] Did you have a retirement plan what you're going to do when you retired?
[02:06:34] No.
[02:06:35] No man.
[02:06:36] We had bought a farm in Wisconsin probably 10 years before that.
[02:06:40] I wanted to go back to my farm.
[02:06:41] Who is taking care of the farm?
[02:06:43] My neighbors.
[02:06:44] How many acres is the farm?
[02:06:47] It was 80.
[02:06:48] And what kind of farm is it?
[02:06:49] Hey.
[02:06:50] And we raised animals and all that stuff.
[02:06:52] So I got out and I did this corporate leadership stuff with Larry for a couple of years.
[02:06:58] I didn't stop working.
[02:07:00] And I did that and then what corporate leadership where you are just helping corporations with
[02:07:05] their leadership type thing and executive coaching certain things.
[02:07:09] I mean, yeah, the stuff you do but not nearly at the same level.
[02:07:11] I mean, you've taken it beyond, you know, and it wasn't interesting to me.
[02:07:16] So I'm like, you know what, let's go back to the farm.
[02:07:19] Where were you living when you were doing that?
[02:07:21] That was we lived in Maple Grove, which is in Minnesota.
[02:07:24] Okay.
[02:07:25] So you moved to Minnesota after you retired?
[02:07:27] Or like a year because we wanted our youngest son to be able to graduate from high school.
[02:07:34] At that point, he had gone to four different high schools.
[02:07:37] So we found a nice Christian Academy.
[02:07:39] That's really why I did all that stuff so that he could have that period of time where
[02:07:44] he could actually graduate from high school in a place that and where we lived is fantastic.
[02:07:49] It was butternut Wisconsin.
[02:07:51] It's a very small place and we just wanted him to be able to round out his education in
[02:07:56] a Christian setting.
[02:07:57] And that was not available there.
[02:07:59] And then we went back to the farm and the cafe in town was called the butternut cafe.
[02:08:07] Surprisingly enough.
[02:08:09] But it failed.
[02:08:12] So the owner of the building, the person running the cafe, it didn't work well.
[02:08:16] So it closed.
[02:08:18] There's 326 people in the village.
[02:08:25] These people had they had taken care of our farm for like a decade.
[02:08:30] I went to Afghanistan, Iraq, the Horn of Africa and the station in Germany for three years.
[02:08:35] Nothing happened to that place.
[02:08:37] Not a window broken of my neighbors.
[02:08:39] Tom and Maria Schulke, they'd mow our front lawn is like an acre and they would not take
[02:08:43] money for gas.
[02:08:44] We are not your servants.
[02:08:45] We're your neighbors.
[02:08:46] I mean, that's what these that people think that Americans are like these.
[02:08:51] The image of Americans, it's not Manhattan, dude.
[02:08:55] That's it.
[02:08:56] I mean, I live in America and people bend over backwards.
[02:08:58] We have so much more in common with each other than differences and it's being exploited
[02:09:02] by these folks that are trying to do, I think, horrible things for the country.
[02:09:07] But that's really America where I live now in Perry D. Sheen.
[02:09:09] It's America, you know.
[02:09:11] So this place closes, the village takes a huge hit.
[02:09:14] And I'm like, man, so I talked to Sergey and I'm like, let's get this going again.
[02:09:19] So I bought the building from a bank, gutted it, put in new equipment.
[02:09:24] I worked in a restaurant for like a year or something before I joined the Navy.
[02:09:29] Sarah was a waitress for three months in high school.
[02:09:33] But you know, I'm a quick study.
[02:09:35] I love cooking.
[02:09:36] I've cooked around the world.
[02:09:37] You know, I did.
[02:09:38] I've made bread on five continents, dude, like made bread from flour.
[02:09:41] I haven't made bread on one.
[02:09:44] It's cathartic.
[02:09:46] So we got the cafe going again and then sold it to a local lady at my BFF.
[02:09:51] Her name's Bobby Munoz.
[02:09:53] She's awesome.
[02:09:54] And you know, that's random.
[02:09:56] So so many people talk about things.
[02:10:01] And a lot of people have money in there.
[02:10:03] They'll throw money at problems.
[02:10:04] You know, the government tries to throw money at problems, right?
[02:10:08] If you say you're going to do something, dude, and the most valuable gift you can give somebody
[02:10:13] is your time.
[02:10:16] You have a finite amount of time on this planet.
[02:10:19] Now as a Christian, I believe that, you know, something beyond this, but a lot of people
[02:10:22] don't.
[02:10:23] You only have you only have so much time.
[02:10:26] So if you really care about somebody, give me your time.
[02:10:29] Sit down with them.
[02:10:30] Give them time.
[02:10:31] So we we gave two years of our time back to that village because they're so dear to us.
[02:10:38] And you know, I walked away net neutral.
[02:10:42] But the impact of showing people demonstrating to them that you truly care about them is
[02:10:50] priceless.
[02:10:52] You know what I mean?
[02:10:54] Yeah, absolutely.
[02:10:56] You build this business back up.
[02:11:00] You sell the whole thing to your BFF, your BFF.
[02:11:05] What's your BFF's name?
[02:11:06] Bobby.
[02:11:07] Bobby, but Bobby's a female.
[02:11:08] Female.
[02:11:09] Okay.
[02:11:10] So Bobby's now running the business.
[02:11:12] She has she had Jenny run that and Bobby started Bobbers on the lake.
[02:11:20] She wanted to go buy a beer.
[02:11:22] Okay.
[02:11:23] Well, this is important to put out because people are going to want to hit these places.
[02:11:25] Yeah.
[02:11:26] Bobbers, Bobbers on the lake.
[02:11:27] It's in Butternut, Wisconsin from by Bobby.
[02:11:29] I actually want to go to both these places.
[02:11:32] And I don't even drink beer.
[02:11:33] So right.
[02:11:34] Bobby is a whirling dervish.
[02:11:38] I mean, she is on the go.
[02:11:40] I mean, you have all these different, you know, archipelago, adventure.
[02:11:43] She's got the same thing going.
[02:11:44] I mean, she's just.
[02:11:46] Okay.
[02:11:47] So you sell that business and now you move back to the farm?
[02:11:50] No, I'm living on the farm.
[02:11:52] Okay.
[02:11:53] You're living on the farm and then I'm turning 50.
[02:11:55] So this was three years ago.
[02:11:59] And I'm like, this, this is another point in my life where you can either, you know,
[02:12:04] kind of like just stay stagnant or you should do something to keep yourself rolling.
[02:12:12] Right.
[02:12:13] So I'm like, I'm going to go to law school and just like Bud's man, you can't just go
[02:12:18] to law school.
[02:12:19] Why can't I just go to law school?
[02:12:20] Right.
[02:12:21] So I studied for the LSAT for a month on the Khan Academy, which is awesome.
[02:12:25] It's free.
[02:12:26] You know, and took it and I got accepted to law school.
[02:12:30] Mitchell Hamlin in St. Paul.
[02:12:32] But during, so during this period of time, we did what we call cousin camp.
[02:12:37] So we got all the cousins.
[02:12:39] So, you know, our, my brother-in-law's and all the kids.
[02:12:42] We got 570 people.
[02:12:44] We get them all together and they were given Sarah, excuse me, hard time about how difficult
[02:12:52] it was to exit this point.
[02:12:54] We had four grandkids, I think, and we're having, yeah, we had, we were having, we had
[02:12:59] three, we're having our fourth, fifth and sixth grandkids.
[02:13:02] They're going to be born in a two month window.
[02:13:05] And so they're giving Sarah Jane a hard time about how difficult it was to visit our farm
[02:13:12] way up north.
[02:13:13] And it was like an hour and 45 minutes to the closest regional airport.
[02:13:17] And then if you're flying to there, it's an extra 200 bucks a person.
[02:13:20] You know, I'm not a wealthy guy.
[02:13:21] We live on our enlisted retirement.
[02:13:22] I can't afford that stuff.
[02:13:24] And, or you'd find a Minneapolis and it's like a four and a half hour drive.
[02:13:27] So I'm like, check, got it.
[02:13:29] I missed the kids growing up.
[02:13:30] I did, you know, I was working, deployed, training, all that stuff.
[02:13:34] So I set preconditions, two of them.
[02:13:39] Well, I love that place up there, it took us 15 years to get the house, you know, up
[02:13:43] to, it was just perfect.
[02:13:46] And I'm like, two conditions.
[02:13:49] Wait, the family wants you to move.
[02:13:51] My wife wants us to go someplace closer to an airport so that our grandkids can visit
[02:13:56] us and we can visit them more regularly.
[02:13:58] Right.
[02:13:59] And I'd missed our kids growing up because I was a frogman, natural environment combat.
[02:14:04] So I was two conditions, it has to be in Wisconsin and it has to be a hobby farm.
[02:14:11] So I get on the old internet in the kitchen, the farm, I find this place in Hager City,
[02:14:17] which I did a one hour circumference around the airport, same part got it.
[02:14:22] Right.
[02:14:23] And it had to be on what I call the right side of the river.
[02:14:25] That's politically and geographically correct.
[02:14:29] And so I find this place in Hager City, I call them, it's going on the market the next
[02:14:34] day, small hobby farm, old farmhouse, 19 acres, 13 tillable, alfalfa, not hay anymore.
[02:14:39] Like check.
[02:14:40] I drive down the next day, I look at it, I go, okay, this is it.
[02:14:44] Put in an offer by the house, move down there.
[02:14:47] Did you sell the other place?
[02:14:49] We sold it after a couple months.
[02:14:52] So it's gone.
[02:14:53] And excuse me.
[02:14:55] So interestingly enough, this is how I wound up running for Congress because Sean Duffy,
[02:15:04] who was my rep for the longest time, if you look at Wisconsin, the Ashland County is like
[02:15:10] right in the middle to the top, right?
[02:15:13] And it's right next to Lake Superior.
[02:15:15] Just past Glidden, which is the next village up from Butternut, it becomes very liberal
[02:15:20] because there's a environmentalist liberal arts college here, North, Northland's College,
[02:15:27] right?
[02:15:28] So Sean and his crew would stop in Butternut.
[02:15:31] And he's a U.S. Congressman.
[02:15:32] Now he's on Fox all the time with Rachel, Capitol stuff.
[02:15:35] Great couple, nine kids.
[02:15:37] But so they would stop in our village and I'd cook for him and his staff.
[02:15:42] So if something was coming up, it'd be like, oh, I'll just call Sean and ask him what's
[02:15:45] going on, you know?
[02:15:47] And so I moved down and that's in Pierce County, right?
[02:15:52] Which is in the third congressional district, not the seventh congressional district.
[02:15:55] I don't know any of this stuff.
[02:15:56] I never tracked politics or anything, right?
[02:15:59] So I'm like, oh, this impeachment was coming on.
[02:16:01] I did human intelligence for a very long period of time.
[02:16:05] I read the Steele dossier and I knew it was absolute junk.
[02:16:09] This is manufactured.
[02:16:11] This is not true.
[02:16:12] It was submitted by a guy who was a former British intelligence officer that was clearly
[02:16:16] colluding with Russian intelligence officers to produce this thing and it's paid for by
[02:16:21] who?
[02:16:22] No.
[02:16:23] I knew it was junk, right?
[02:16:24] So I'm like, who's my congressman?
[02:16:25] You know, because it's not Sean anymore.
[02:16:27] I'm like, whoa, hey, Ron kind, what's your stance on the impeachment of Donald Trump for
[02:16:35] the Russian collusion stuff?
[02:16:37] Didn't write me back.
[02:16:39] Nothing crickets chirping.
[02:16:40] And I'm like, what?
[02:16:43] Dude, the job title is representative.
[02:16:46] It's not your lordship.
[02:16:47] You know what I mean?
[02:16:48] This is not how a representative democracy is supposed to function and it sure didn't
[02:16:52] with Sean.
[02:16:54] So I'm getting steamed and I start looking into this cat, right?
[02:16:58] I mean, finding terrorists in Pakistan is super hard.
[02:17:02] You know what I mean?
[02:17:03] It's very difficult.
[02:17:04] It is not difficult finding out what politicians are doing.
[02:17:09] So I started looking at this guy from the perspective of doing human intelligence and
[02:17:13] finding out what this cat had been doing.
[02:17:15] He'd been in office for 20, two or 23 years at the time.
[02:17:19] Saying stuff in the district, you can find it in newspaper articles and interviews.
[02:17:24] And then I'd compare that to his actual voting record.
[02:17:27] And he was just wrong.
[02:17:29] He would say one thing, go to DC and do another thing because he was working for the behest
[02:17:34] of special interest groups, not the people he's representing, right?
[02:17:39] So the impeachment vote goes down.
[02:17:43] He is number 435 out of 435 representatives to cast his vote, made public on the floor
[02:17:49] because he had to.
[02:17:50] He told everybody in the district he wasn't going to vote for that impeachment because
[02:17:53] it was junk.
[02:17:54] I'm not doing that.
[02:17:56] Well, he did it hoping to slide it under the radar.
[02:17:59] Nope.
[02:18:00] So I sent a text message to this guy named Jim who worked for Sean.
[02:18:03] I'm like, Jim, who are you guys running against this guy?
[02:18:06] And he writes me back and he goes, you know, and I write him back and go, ha ha ha.
[02:18:11] And he didn't write me back.
[02:18:12] So when you write something and somebody writes, ha ha ha, and they don't write back, they're
[02:18:17] not joking.
[02:18:19] And I was like, oh yeah, I should be right.
[02:18:24] I fixed problems for decades.
[02:18:28] So why aren't I fixing this problem?
[02:18:30] And I decided to run for Congress.
[02:18:33] So I got a hold of the RPW, Mark Jefferson, his executive director.
[02:18:37] I did an interview with him.
[02:18:39] And he's like, well, yeah, I guess.
[02:18:42] And I formed this nascent political group.
[02:18:47] Is this 2019?
[02:18:48] This would be 2019.
[02:18:49] Yeah.
[02:18:50] So in 2019, and I formed my team.
[02:18:55] I didn't know what I was doing.
[02:18:56] Here's the metrics.
[02:18:57] People like, there are these metrics.
[02:18:59] So Ron kind had been in office for at that point, 24 years, 25 years, something like that.
[02:19:06] He had $3.1 million in the bank.
[02:19:09] He had a functioning political organization.
[02:19:12] And he had 100% name recognition, 100% kind.
[02:19:17] Right?
[02:19:18] They have those kind bars.
[02:19:19] That's not him.
[02:19:21] I had never thought about being in politics ever, my entire life.
[02:19:27] We moved to the district to be closer to the airport so we can visit our children.
[02:19:31] So the only person that knew my name was my wife.
[02:19:35] I have no money at all, zero name recognition.
[02:19:39] That's the starting point.
[02:19:41] I decided to run for office.
[02:19:43] 72 hours, I announced my candidacy.
[02:19:45] They locked down the entire planet with COVID.
[02:19:48] Boom.
[02:19:49] So I ran a nine month campaign against those odds.
[02:19:54] I came within like two and a half points of beating this guy.
[02:19:58] And he wanted to spend over $6 million against me.
[02:20:03] That's why he resigned.
[02:20:04] Because I announced my candidacy.
[02:20:07] I lost.
[02:20:08] And I tried to, this is amazing.
[02:20:12] You can say whatever you want about the 2020 election.
[02:20:14] But I did the math.
[02:20:15] I look at this.
[02:20:16] I lost by 11,000 votes.
[02:20:17] I go, I can't make up 11,000 votes.
[02:20:20] You know what I mean?
[02:20:21] Even if we found statistical anomalies and all that stuff, that's what I mean.
[02:20:24] I can't, you know, I'm not going to be able to overcome that.
[02:20:27] I try to call that cat.
[02:20:28] I go, that night, like four in the morning, calling to concede the election.
[02:20:32] Right?
[02:20:33] Because you should.
[02:20:34] He wouldn't take the phone call.
[02:20:36] Interesting.
[02:20:37] Not interesting.
[02:20:38] That's an egotistical person whose entire being is based on being a politician who liked
[02:20:44] being called to congressmen, had people open their doors for him.
[02:20:47] And I got so close to beating him, like all throughout the night I was ahead.
[02:20:52] And then like 15,000 votes show up at, you know, 2.30 in the morning or whatever, you
[02:20:55] know, I get it.
[02:20:56] Check their counting ballots that come in.
[02:20:57] I get it.
[02:21:00] He was so angry, he wouldn't take a phone call.
[02:21:04] Not someone who has no business being in leadership anywhere.
[02:21:07] Right?
[02:21:08] I've heard of sore losers.
[02:21:10] Soar winners.
[02:21:11] What?
[02:21:12] No.
[02:21:13] So, um, yeah, I decided to run again because I was talking to Sarah Jane.
[02:21:17] I mean, really that night I go, this is not going to bode well for the country, not me
[02:21:23] personally.
[02:21:24] I mean, my ego, it's over here.
[02:21:26] This is not about me.
[02:21:30] It's not.
[02:21:31] It's about our country and our grandkids.
[02:21:32] At that point we had six grandkids, you know, eight now.
[02:21:36] So I understood that.
[02:21:38] I had no idea it was going to get this bad this fast.
[02:21:43] No one could predict this.
[02:21:44] You just can't.
[02:21:46] You could not.
[02:21:47] But I decided to run again.
[02:21:49] I waited, I shepherd everything.
[02:21:50] I did some changes in my team.
[02:21:53] And then we wound up running the number one political campaign in the entire nation for
[02:21:57] 2021 from Prairie to Sheen, you know, 5,600 people.
[02:22:01] And then what, what, what makes you classify it against the number one political campaign
[02:22:04] in the whole country?
[02:22:05] So what the inside baseball stuff, because everybody understands intuitively or they
[02:22:09] just know it, um, is that in order to get a word out, you have to be able to raise enough
[02:22:14] funds to, to get the word out.
[02:22:18] You know, I don't get any money from my campaign.
[02:22:19] You can take a salary from a campaign.
[02:22:21] I don't, I just don't think that's, you should do that.
[02:22:24] But you have to buy television advertising cable, you print media, you got to pay a staff,
[02:22:29] you know, all this stuff, gasoline, whatever.
[02:22:32] So um, yeah, we, we raise more money than any Republican challenge or in the entire nation
[02:22:36] in 2021.
[02:22:37] But what drove that?
[02:22:40] Me and my team.
[02:22:42] I have an exceptionally good team.
[02:22:44] I'm so incredibly proud of my team.
[02:22:46] And you, you can perform at a high level for only a certain period of time.
[02:22:50] You know this, you got to sleep at some time.
[02:22:52] So how do you, how do you pull off sustained superior performance?
[02:22:56] You make sure that you assemble the best team you possibly can.
[02:22:58] So I have incredibly dedicated people who are all on board for the right reasons.
[02:23:02] I integrate every single one of them personally and make sure that they're in this for something
[02:23:07] beyond themselves, which is the country.
[02:23:09] That's why we're successful.
[02:23:10] Our mission is completely pure.
[02:23:12] Message is pure.
[02:23:14] And we're here for the right reasons.
[02:23:15] We want to save our country.
[02:23:17] And that's very, very rare.
[02:23:19] I think there are some fantastic people in public office and leadership right now.
[02:23:23] They're, they're fantastic.
[02:23:24] A lot of them.
[02:23:25] But other people are just kind of there.
[02:23:27] They're the dude that was the Marops instructor for 15 years, you know, a trade at.
[02:23:33] They're doing a function, but you know, why are they doing it?
[02:23:37] That's why we're successful.
[02:23:39] So what does this look like from here on out from, but what's the next, how, how many
[02:23:44] months are we away right now?
[02:23:47] We're 42 days.
[02:23:48] 42 days away.
[02:23:49] And what does the next 42 days look like?
[02:23:52] I work.
[02:23:54] I, um, meeting, meeting, meeting, meeting, meeting, meeting.
[02:23:59] This is my schedule.
[02:24:00] I've been doing this for three years, dude.
[02:24:02] Who do you meet with?
[02:24:04] I meet with a bunch of different people.
[02:24:07] My favorite meetings are with the guys in the district, the people I'm going to be representing.
[02:24:10] I mean, what is going on, man?
[02:24:13] Like how is your farm doing?
[02:24:16] What is affecting you so that you can or cannot provide for your family as well?
[02:24:21] The biggest thing we get input costs through the roof.
[02:24:23] Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline.
[02:24:26] Okay.
[02:24:27] Check this out.
[02:24:28] Got any Tim Michaels is running for governor.
[02:24:30] Then he's been a friend of mine for, I don't know, three years now or something.
[02:24:34] Start.
[02:24:35] He had his dad started a company.
[02:24:36] He had a couple of hundred employees.
[02:24:37] He has like 8,000 now.
[02:24:38] He's going to win.
[02:24:40] He calls me like the day or so after Biden gets sworn in, goes Derek, I just had to lay
[02:24:45] off 700 people.
[02:24:47] And I'm like, what do you mean, Tim?
[02:24:48] He's like, we were doing the electrical substations for the Keystone pipeline and Biden just went
[02:24:54] flick, shut that off.
[02:24:57] So the cascading effects of these things, people don't understand.
[02:25:01] And I do intuitively because I wrote all these plans and did this stuff and it's something
[02:25:04] I'm good at.
[02:25:05] So here's what happens when you stop natural gas movement and production.
[02:25:09] Do you know where fertilizer comes from, Jaco?
[02:25:11] Yeah.
[02:25:12] Natural gas.
[02:25:13] That's the nitrogen that comes from, that's where it comes from.
[02:25:17] The Wisconsin's third district is one of the top five users of propane and natural gas
[02:25:21] for home heating in the country.
[02:25:23] It gets 20 degrees below zero.
[02:25:26] You're not going to put an extra sweater on it like your mom used to tell you.
[02:25:28] What about solar?
[02:25:32] So check it out.
[02:25:35] We want our grandchildren to have power, right?
[02:25:38] But we have kids now.
[02:25:39] So the Biden administration is trying to skip ahead a generation.
[02:25:42] You can't do that.
[02:25:43] The guy named Brent Ridge runs Dairyland Power, one of the biggest co-ops in my district.
[02:25:48] We have a lot of co-ops because they're rural.
[02:25:51] They did the math.
[02:25:53] So the Biden administration wants to be carbon neutral by 2030.
[02:25:57] Okay?
[02:25:58] A noble goal.
[02:25:59] You know what that takes?
[02:26:00] You have to double the amount of all of the nuke plants on the entire planet.
[02:26:06] So that is not a real goal.
[02:26:10] It's just not.
[02:26:11] So people are eating it right now because of these horrible policies.
[02:26:18] Just that simple.
[02:26:19] It's got to stop, man.
[02:26:20] Yeah.
[02:26:21] You know, people that are in business with me, and there's a lot of them.
[02:26:24] We've got a lot of different businesses.
[02:26:28] Sure.
[02:26:29] And anyone that works with me knows that when I'm looking at things and we're assessing
[02:26:33] something, I'll get to a point where I say, all right, run the numbers.
[02:26:36] Right.
[02:26:37] You know, which is, okay, well, tell me what this is going to cost.
[02:26:39] How much we're going to put it into it?
[02:26:40] What's the ROI look like?
[02:26:41] What's the risk?
[02:26:42] Well, run the numbers.
[02:26:43] Tell me what the numbers look like because that's ultimately, and then the numbers,
[02:26:47] you have to put that into the calculus of your gut feeling for sure.
[02:26:52] But you can have a really strong positive gut feeling like, hey, this sounds like a
[02:26:55] great idea.
[02:26:56] And then you run the numbers and you go, hey, it's probably not going to work, man.
[02:26:59] That's just too much.
[02:27:01] Sometimes you go, you know what?
[02:27:02] This is not a bad idea.
[02:27:03] You run the numbers and you go, hey, this actually makes sense.
[02:27:05] We can go for this.
[02:27:08] And that's why kind of, you know, when you mentioned the closing of the pipeline, it
[02:27:11] kind of, you know, because emotionally you think, well, this seems like a positive thing.
[02:27:16] You know, people can look at it and go, hey, but we don't want to have to put pipes through
[02:27:21] fields and then you run the numbers.
[02:27:24] Right.
[02:27:25] And you just run the numbers.
[02:27:27] And it's not even really that close.
[02:27:29] You know, it's the type of math that you just said, oh, we got to double the number of nuclear
[02:27:32] plants in the next three years if we're going to get there.
[02:27:35] That's what it's going to take.
[02:27:36] In the world.
[02:27:37] In the world.
[02:27:38] Right.
[02:27:39] So check this out, man.
[02:27:40] We don't do enough running of numbers.
[02:27:43] So you know, when you go to your house, let's say you're going to wash your hands and you
[02:27:48] turn the faucet on and a little train car comes with water, right?
[02:27:52] And then you pour the water out of the train car.
[02:27:55] No.
[02:27:56] How does it get into your faucet with a pipe?
[02:27:59] Because it's the most efficient way to transport fluids.
[02:28:02] Not even close.
[02:28:03] Right.
[02:28:04] And it's, and then you want to like light your gas stove.
[02:28:06] Does a little train come and then you get gas?
[02:28:08] No, that comes from a pipe too.
[02:28:10] Now trains themselves, we, I'm in Prairie DeChain.
[02:28:13] It's like train city USA, man.
[02:28:16] Transporting bulk items like coal, for instance, and some other large POL things.
[02:28:23] If you're going from point to point, you have to have a railhead, right?
[02:28:27] So there's room for both of them.
[02:28:29] That's what folks don't understand.
[02:28:31] But we have a carbon based economy.
[02:28:35] And if you shut off the fossil fuels that produce carbon, you're going to destroy the
[02:28:42] economy.
[02:28:43] That's what's happening right now.
[02:28:44] You look at the food cost, dude.
[02:28:46] Farmers have not locked in, wait, check it out.
[02:28:48] Farmers have not locked in fertilizer prices for next year.
[02:28:51] So it's going to keep going up and up and up.
[02:28:53] There's two fertilizer plants that just closed in England.
[02:28:58] There's one in Finland that went down.
[02:29:00] I think they're only going to produce 24% of the fertilizer that they did before.
[02:29:05] Russia is not going to export fertilizer anymore, probably for the future, at least
[02:29:08] five years.
[02:29:09] I mean, they hate us right now.
[02:29:11] And there's these weird tariffs that we put on Morocco where they produce some fertilizers.
[02:29:17] What can Congress do?
[02:29:19] One thing right now, put pressure on the Biden administration to make sure that they open
[02:29:24] up permitting and then get rid of the tariffs on Morocco.
[02:29:29] So looking at all of these problems, people get really worried about a lot of stuff.
[02:29:35] And the current leadership of the Republican Party, Kevin McCarthy in the House, we actually
[02:29:39] have a plan.
[02:29:41] And they've done a tremendous job of looking at all the problems and figuring out which
[02:29:46] one of these from the federal level will we have the greatest probability of having the
[02:29:51] greatest positive effect.
[02:29:53] You know, that's how you're supposed to govern.
[02:29:55] So I'm actually very excited.
[02:29:58] The polls are looking outstanding for us.
[02:30:00] When I say us, I mean my team.
[02:30:02] I know I'm the head of the team, but us, we've done this together.
[02:30:08] So I anticipate being elected in November and giving it a go, man.
[02:30:12] It's not funny.
[02:30:14] I think about that, dude.
[02:30:15] I come from the meanest circumstances.
[02:30:18] The meanest.
[02:30:19] Well, you know, when I kind of opened with that thing from George Washington, I'd heard
[02:30:24] that quote, read that quote a while ago and you know, you think about, you know, I just
[02:30:31] know your career and know what, you know, as an average team guy, what you've done,
[02:30:37] what you've been put through, what your family's been put through.
[02:30:41] And it's like, how much are you going to ask from somebody?
[02:30:43] And I look at the political arena and it makes me sick to my stomach.
[02:30:48] Like I don't, I just think that just sounds, the whole thing sounds awful.
[02:30:52] When you show me your calendar and I know you're going to a bunch of meetings with people
[02:30:55] that half of them, you know, are horrible people, half of them are awesome people.
[02:30:58] You got all this craziness going on.
[02:31:01] I would not say that.
[02:31:02] Okay.
[02:31:03] The vast majority of them are awesome.
[02:31:04] Okay.
[02:31:05] Like vast.
[02:31:06] Well, I know that when I look at what happens to politicians and you're going to get just,
[02:31:12] you know, your life becomes this target, right?
[02:31:16] And so I know that there's a ton of sacrifice that you and your family are going to make
[02:31:21] again.
[02:31:22] You bet.
[02:31:23] In order to do this.
[02:31:25] And yeah, I guess you wouldn't be setting meetings with people that despise you, but
[02:31:28] look, the press is going to absolutely about a large majority of the press will absolutely
[02:31:34] despise you and they're going to do everything to attack you.
[02:31:36] They're going to attack your family.
[02:31:37] They're going to attack your values, your home, your people, your community and everything.
[02:31:42] So the fact that you're like, yeah, cool, Roger that, going to step up and try and make
[02:31:47] this happen and looks like you are going to make this thing happen.
[02:31:50] I'm not going to go there.
[02:31:53] When you look at all the divisiveness in the country right now, one of the things that
[02:32:00] I've given an answer to a bunch is something that we already kind of discussed, which is,
[02:32:04] Hey, I look at something from my perspective and I think, well, you know, Derek has a good
[02:32:09] point there.
[02:32:10] Maybe he's right about this.
[02:32:12] Instead of me thinking, well, Derek doesn't agree with every single point that I have.
[02:32:15] So therefore he's completely wrong about everything.
[02:32:18] I actually hate him.
[02:32:21] How do we try to open people's minds up to get, Hey, you know what?
[02:32:25] I get that you see things a little bit differently and you come from a different background than
[02:32:28] me and I understand your idea.
[02:32:32] At least I know where you're trying to go and it seems like in most cases we can be at
[02:32:37] least somewhat aligned.
[02:32:39] You know, you want for food prices to come down.
[02:32:45] That seems like a universal universal.
[02:32:47] Who would say, No, we think food should be more expensive.
[02:32:51] So what we really should be talking about is if you want food prices to come down and
[02:32:57] let's say you're a conservative, you're a conservative Republican and let's say I'm
[02:33:01] a left wing Democrat and I want food prices to come down.
[02:33:06] So we're actually aligned on where we want to go on that particular subject.
[02:33:11] But it's like there can't even be agreement on that and we can have a logical discussion
[02:33:18] about, Well, okay, well, run the numbers.
[02:33:21] Show me the numbers that you're looking at and I'll show you the numbers that we're
[02:33:22] looking at and let's have a discussion about how we can actually make the food prices come
[02:33:27] down.
[02:33:28] Let's try and figure something out.
[02:33:30] How do we cross that bridge?
[02:33:32] Well, how I plan on crossing that bridge.
[02:33:35] So first and foremost, everyone needs to understand that I will work with anybody who is willing
[02:33:40] to put the interest of the country above their own.
[02:33:43] I don't care who you are, I will work with you and I've proven that over 26 years and
[02:33:47] working the most diverse environments and hostile straight up hostile environments, people
[02:33:53] trying to kill me environment.
[02:33:55] So if you're going to put the betterment of the country in your congressional district
[02:33:59] above your own personal interest, I'm on board.
[02:34:04] And this is this is what I tell people to echoes what you're saying.
[02:34:08] I said, you're going to agree with people oftentimes 90% of the time.
[02:34:14] You know, if I agree with somebody 90% of the time, that's that's a big win, right?
[02:34:19] How many people here can look themselves in the mirror and honestly say that you agree
[02:34:24] with your spouse 90% of the time?
[02:34:28] Almost nobody, right?
[02:34:29] So finding common ground, that's the term finding common ground is imperative to make
[02:34:35] sure that you can actually govern and when you do things strictly on party lines, you
[02:34:40] lose the ability to closely identify common ground.
[02:34:44] How Congress has gotten around this is they put these big omnibus bills together.
[02:34:50] So you're going to using your example, this is going to unleash American energy.
[02:34:58] Therefore the input cost for farming are going to go down.
[02:35:00] That means food costs are going to go down or this is going to decrease the price of
[02:35:04] diesel fuel, which decreases the transportation costs.
[02:35:07] You understand, right?
[02:35:08] And then they'll put something in here like, but we're going to have flag laws and you're
[02:35:13] going to have your guns confiscated confiscated by the state, you know, which I fundamentally
[02:35:17] did that is just wrong, right?
[02:35:19] And they put them in the same bill so that they can vote on it for or against it and
[02:35:25] they can justify it when they go back to their district.
[02:35:28] That's got to stop.
[02:35:30] It has to stop because in no way, shape or form do I support red flag laws.
[02:35:37] I'll give you an example.
[02:35:38] A well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free state, the right for
[02:35:41] the people to keep their arms shall not be infringed.
[02:35:44] That's the entire text of the Second Amendment, dude.
[02:35:46] So that's out, but lowering food cost is in.
[02:35:50] So in order to hold Congress accountable, Congress has to write clean legislation so
[02:35:57] that I know exactly where Jaco and Echo sit on an issue.
[02:36:03] That's got to happen.
[02:36:04] Are we going to be able to pull it off?
[02:36:05] I don't know.
[02:36:08] But one of the things that I will do that everybody can count on is I will do me.
[02:36:15] Meaning, like the first pledge that I make to everybody is I will not buy, sell or trade
[02:36:20] individual stocks as long as I'm a sitting member of Congress.
[02:36:23] I will not do that.
[02:36:25] And people are like, well, what about this guy?
[02:36:26] What about that guy?
[02:36:27] What about that guy?
[02:36:28] I'm going to do me.
[02:36:29] I'm going to make sure that all the things I'm doing are as morally and ethically and
[02:36:34] legally correct as I possibly can as a human being when I'm in Congress.
[02:36:38] I'll start there.
[02:36:40] Encourage is contagious.
[02:36:41] We talked about that.
[02:36:43] I mean, ideally, people will see that and the people that I'm working with, they'll
[02:36:49] want to do that too.
[02:36:50] I mean, people inherently, you know, they want to do things in a way that's beneficial
[02:36:57] for other people.
[02:36:58] The American people are benevolent.
[02:36:59] We're the most generous country that has ever existed.
[02:37:03] Our populace, you know, the regular people on the street.
[02:37:07] So if you give them the opportunity to do what's right, a lot of people are going to
[02:37:11] do what's right.
[02:37:12] They just need to see somebody else do it.
[02:37:14] You know what I mean?
[02:37:17] Yeah.
[02:37:18] I think America right now, you know, you're looking at anybody looks at some bill that's
[02:37:31] coming before Congress, coming before the House, and it's whatever, 792 pages.
[02:37:37] They don't even read it.
[02:37:40] And there's not one person America that goes, that seems like a good thing.
[02:37:44] And you could go down a whole laundry list of things that every American says, this is
[02:37:49] bullshit.
[02:37:51] This is bullshit.
[02:37:52] What you just talked about, like having these multiple different.
[02:37:54] Yeah.
[02:37:55] Yeah.
[02:37:56] Omnibus bills.
[02:37:57] We got all these different categories that are being voted on in one bill.
[02:38:02] Every American, every American goes, that's bullshit.
[02:38:07] And there's only so long that the politicians can continue to get away with this bullshit
[02:38:14] before Americans, because you got to remember where the people that were like, oh, you're
[02:38:17] going to raise the tax on tea by two cents per freaking giant bundle of tea.
[02:38:26] Yeah.
[02:38:27] No, actually, we're going to fight you.
[02:38:29] At some point, Americans go, hey, this is bullshit.
[02:38:32] And we're going to get rid of you people that are doing these things that are clearly wrong.
[02:38:39] They're so clearly wrong.
[02:38:41] Everybody knows it.
[02:38:42] And eventually we say, oh, yeah, we're done.
[02:38:45] Now look, I don't even think it's going to, I think it's going to be a change like you're
[02:38:50] the personification of this change.
[02:38:52] Right?
[02:38:53] It's not like everyone's going to get voted out tomorrow, but people are going to, oh,
[02:38:56] yeah.
[02:38:57] There's a guy that just went in there and said, yeah, this is a dumb idea.
[02:38:58] Hey, you guys can't pull a wool over the Americans eyes anymore.
[02:39:02] I think over the next several years, maybe even take five, maybe even take 10 years,
[02:39:07] we're going to get rid of these things that are, for lack of a better word, bullshit.
[02:39:13] Right.
[02:39:14] So I want to be very clear.
[02:39:16] I am absolutely, I 100% disavow any type of political violence.
[02:39:22] I do not condone it.
[02:39:24] And that will be the destruction of America if we take up arms against each other.
[02:39:28] I'll have no part of that.
[02:39:30] First time once combat Bosnia-Hurkshukovia, civil war, went to Afghanistan, turned into
[02:39:34] civil war, Iraq turned into civil war, worked in the Horn of Africa, civil war.
[02:39:37] I'll have no part of that in the United States of America.
[02:39:40] So how do we prevent that from happening, which I will do anything to prevent that from
[02:39:44] happening.
[02:39:45] Political violence cannot be part of a discussion in the United States of America.
[02:39:49] It cannot.
[02:39:50] So how do we do it?
[02:39:52] We do it by what you're saying.
[02:39:56] We exercise our rights as American citizens and we get into office and we make the change
[02:40:03] from the inside.
[02:40:04] And here's what's, this is fascinating dude.
[02:40:08] Okay.
[02:40:10] Ask not what your country can do for you.
[02:40:12] Ask what you can do for your country.
[02:40:14] You want to say that?
[02:40:16] John F. Kennedy, JFK said that, right?
[02:40:19] So he said that in 62?
[02:40:22] 61, 62.
[02:40:25] So we went from that, ask not what your country can do for you.
[02:40:27] Ask what you can do for your country.
[02:40:29] We went from that to you're going to do everything I say you're going to do.
[02:40:34] You're going to lock your church.
[02:40:35] You're going to close your business.
[02:40:36] You're not going to be able to speak to each other freely.
[02:40:39] You're going to go to this store, but not that store.
[02:40:42] You're going to get a shot or you're going to get fired.
[02:40:45] You're going to do everything.
[02:40:46] You're going to give me your money, the sweat of your brow.
[02:40:50] And if you don't willingly do this, I'm going to use the full course of power of the federal
[02:40:54] government to compel you to do this.
[02:40:58] You got that?
[02:40:59] Who's that?
[02:41:00] That's AOC.
[02:41:03] So the Democrat party went from JFK to AOC in 50 some years.
[02:41:09] How?
[02:41:11] Republicans let them.
[02:41:13] Something goes wrong on a mission.
[02:41:14] Who's the first person you look at, dude?
[02:41:16] It's you.
[02:41:17] What did I do or not do that led to the failure of this mission?
[02:41:21] Hopefully you're saying what did I do or not do that led to the success of this mission,
[02:41:25] right?
[02:41:26] Never take anything for granted.
[02:41:27] So we as Republicans have let people get away with this for such an extended period of time.
[02:41:32] And we've done it by saying, oh, they have the best interests of the country at hand.
[02:41:36] They really do.
[02:41:37] They want the same thing that we do.
[02:41:39] Yeah, in some aspects you do, but in others they don't.
[02:41:42] And there's people that want to fundamentally change the system of government that has
[02:41:46] proven to be the best one on the entire planet, like ever in history.
[02:41:49] You know what I mean?
[02:41:52] We're one of the youngest countries in the world.
[02:41:53] We are the oldest standing constitution in the world.
[02:41:57] Why?
[02:41:58] Because it is an incredibly functional and beautiful document.
[02:42:01] There's people that want to throw the Constitution out.
[02:42:03] Why?
[02:42:04] Because they're not getting their way.
[02:42:07] So the beauty about our Constitution is something's wrong in it.
[02:42:12] The mechanism for changing it is written into the document itself.
[02:42:15] It's the amendment process.
[02:42:16] You know what I mean?
[02:42:18] So use it.
[02:42:19] And they're like, well, it's so hard.
[02:42:20] Yeah.
[02:42:21] It's supposed to be.
[02:42:22] Right?
[02:42:23] So are we changing stuff?
[02:42:25] Yeah.
[02:42:26] Are people waking up to how destructive the policies have the destructive effect that
[02:42:34] the policies are having?
[02:42:35] Yeah.
[02:42:36] I mean, I see people that are just beside themselves.
[02:42:38] That $10,000 college thing, they want to give $10,000 for student debt relief.
[02:42:44] Check this out, man.
[02:42:45] 75% of my district does not have a four-year degree.
[02:42:48] Only 9% of my district, 9% has a graduate degree.
[02:42:52] And I did a roundtable with some folks.
[02:42:54] And they're all blue-collar folks.
[02:42:56] This is what, 21,000 square feet?
[02:42:57] Yeah.
[02:42:58] Okay.
[02:42:59] This gym is 21,000 square feet is what he's referring to.
[02:43:01] Yeah.
[02:43:02] Sorry.
[02:43:03] The gym is 21,000 square feet.
[02:43:04] Or we do this thing at a HVAC place.
[02:43:05] It's probably 18, 20,000 square feet.
[02:43:07] Two brothers got this thing going.
[02:43:09] They don't have high school degrees and then trade school.
[02:43:12] We're in this beautiful business.
[02:43:14] All the people are just real estate agents.
[02:43:16] No one had a four-year degree.
[02:43:18] And we're like, well, what do you think about this?
[02:43:19] And I go, this is absurd, right?
[02:43:21] So I do this roundtable, I go to a place to get lunch.
[02:43:23] I'm talking to Hannah, is her name, H in the beginning, H at the end, I remember, because
[02:43:27] she said that stuck in my mind.
[02:43:30] And we started talking.
[02:43:31] She goes, yeah, this is great.
[02:43:32] You know, I graduated from college.
[02:43:33] I have all this debt.
[02:43:34] You know, I'm working here as a bartender.
[02:43:36] And her degree was in, gosh, she was like public or communications with an art major,
[02:43:43] or art minor, right?
[02:43:44] I'm like, well, you know, kind of get what you pay for there.
[02:43:47] She goes, yeah, I think it's a great idea.
[02:43:48] Okay, Hannah, hold on a second.
[02:43:50] Let's say this place is banging on a Friday night.
[02:43:52] And there's 100 people here.
[02:43:55] And you go, all right, time out.
[02:43:57] 91 of you go over there.
[02:44:00] Okay.
[02:44:01] And the other nine, you sit here.
[02:44:04] All 91 of you are going to pay for everything they eat and drink tonight.
[02:44:08] And you're going to sit there and watch them.
[02:44:09] And I go, would they be matched?
[02:44:12] She goes, yeah, that's just unfair.
[02:44:14] And I was like, okay, so 91 folks, even if they were just getting it, you know, you're
[02:44:19] talking 25 bucks a person, maybe?
[02:44:23] I mean, they can have lavish dinner, right?
[02:44:26] So this is $2,500 out of every single American taxpayers wallet to pay for somebody to have
[02:44:32] dinner on you.
[02:44:33] No, that doesn't make sense on any planet, right?
[02:44:38] And I told her that and she's like, wow, yeah, that is just unfair.
[02:44:41] I'm like, Hannah, Hannah, run the numbers.
[02:44:45] Walk the dog.
[02:44:46] That's what I call it.
[02:44:47] Walk the dog on this.
[02:44:48] You know what I mean?
[02:44:49] It doesn't make sense.
[02:44:50] So people are seeing that and there's so many reasons to be discouraged, Jaco.
[02:44:56] And you can always find one.
[02:44:57] You can always find no.
[02:44:58] No is easy.
[02:45:01] It is.
[02:45:02] It's easy to see the world.
[02:45:03] No.
[02:45:04] And it's easy to get discouraged.
[02:45:06] It's easy to get down, you know, with all the circumstances.
[02:45:10] But I'm telling you, if you wake up in the morning like I do and you just have an overwhelming
[02:45:16] sense of gratitude like we talked about, just be so gracious.
[02:45:20] Look at yourself.
[02:45:21] Look at the things, the opportunities that you have as a human being in the United States
[02:45:24] of America right now to create something, to do something worthwhile, to help somebody
[02:45:30] out.
[02:45:31] That doesn't exist in a lot of countries.
[02:45:33] And when you just take a minute and go like, yeah, you know, I'm going to go buy that cup
[02:45:36] of coffee.
[02:45:37] I do that for cops and they're like, I'm sorry, sir, I can't accept a gift.
[02:45:40] And I'm like, you're not the boss me, dude.
[02:45:42] Like I don't work for you.
[02:45:44] Police officer X.
[02:45:45] You know, I'm buying you this cup of coffee, dude.
[02:45:48] Or you help out a homeless person, like help them out, not just throw money at them because
[02:45:52] that doesn't help anybody.
[02:45:53] I mean, it doesn't.
[02:45:55] The ability to do that is unique.
[02:45:57] And we got to remember that.
[02:45:59] And you got to tell your friends.
[02:46:01] And you got to encourage your friends to tell other people because you've seen the downward
[02:46:05] spiral, you know, when things start going bad and then it's just that it's this, this
[02:46:11] negative feedback loop that people get into.
[02:46:14] We're in a negative feedback loop, but the inputs are coming from our government.
[02:46:19] And we should be in a negative feedback loop right now.
[02:46:23] So how do you get out of that?
[02:46:25] You put goodness in there.
[02:46:27] That's what we're doing.
[02:46:28] It's, I mean, some things are so basically, you know, philosophical.
[02:46:34] It was interesting teaching special reconnaissance because you have time to reflect.
[02:46:38] When do you have time to reflect?
[02:46:39] And I mean, they started with videos.
[02:46:42] Remember, like two minutes long, then they made them one minute, then they made them
[02:46:45] 30 seconds.
[02:46:46] Oh, you're just talking about social media videos.
[02:46:48] Yeah, they're what seven seconds now.
[02:46:50] So there's been a crunch of the attention span of people and it removes your ability
[02:46:56] to reflect on something.
[02:46:57] You truly don't understand something until you ponder it and teaching special reconnaissance
[02:47:01] and doing special reconnaissance missions.
[02:47:04] You have time to ponder things.
[02:47:05] Yes, you do.
[02:47:06] And sometimes pondering while you're freezing and starving, you know, but, um, and again,
[02:47:11] starting as a kid, you know, reading so much, reading takes time and reflection.
[02:47:16] And when you're, you're putting an author's voice inside of your mind because you're reading
[02:47:21] it and you're, you know, you're hearing that inside.
[02:47:25] You're not receiving this like a television image.
[02:47:29] It's you internalize it.
[02:47:31] So we're putting some good in there.
[02:47:34] Yeah.
[02:47:35] We're injecting good into the cycle.
[02:47:36] Seriously.
[02:47:37] So being there, it's, I want you to listen to people.
[02:47:39] I want you to be encouraged.
[02:47:40] You live in the best country in the world.
[02:47:42] If you're in America right now, and if you're not, move here legally, emigrate to the United
[02:47:46] States of America and we'll welcome you with open arms if you do it the right way.
[02:47:51] Check.
[02:47:52] That gets us, I think that gets us up to date.
[02:47:54] That's where we're at, right?
[02:47:56] Um, these are excellent, by the way.
[02:47:58] Oh, thank you.
[02:47:59] Yeah.
[02:48:00] Thank you.
[02:48:01] Appreciate it.
[02:48:02] I haven't had one before.
[02:48:03] I guess you have this whole line of everything, right?
[02:48:04] We got a line of a bunch of stuff, you know, we got a, we got, um, we're making supplements
[02:48:08] here.
[02:48:09] Um, we've got clothing, we got factories, we got two factories in Maine, we got maybe
[02:48:15] three factories in Maine, depending on what you're counting as a factory.
[02:48:17] And we just consolidated, we're in the process of consolidating our two factories in North
[02:48:22] Carolina to one factory in North Carolina.
[02:48:24] Well, back up.
[02:48:25] Why don't you have a factory in the third congressional district of the state of Wisconsin?
[02:48:29] We can talk about that.
[02:48:30] Let's talk about that.
[02:48:32] We can go out there and check it out.
[02:48:33] And as, as we grow, which we're growing very rapidly right now, and the reason we're growing
[02:48:37] very rapidly is because people want American made stuff.
[02:48:41] Sure.
[02:48:42] Hey dude, we've got power.
[02:48:43] We've got rail, uh, during the, um, summertime, we've got the Mississippi River to move, uh,
[02:48:49] commodities up and down.
[02:48:50] And I have the most fantastical, hardworking, uh, ethically sound badass Americans in the
[02:48:56] world.
[02:48:57] Well, that, that is, that is outstanding.
[02:48:59] And, and that's what we're looking for.
[02:49:02] Um, you know, we've, we've kind of, we're a little bit maxed out our resources or human
[02:49:06] capital up in Maine.
[02:49:08] We're still getting people that are, I mean, the beautiful thing is we've got people coming
[02:49:11] in from all over the country are moving to Maine, moving to North Carolina, knocking
[02:49:14] on the door.
[02:49:15] I want a job.
[02:49:16] I want to work here.
[02:49:17] It's, it's outstanding.
[02:49:18] Uh, and so that's been a huge part of it.
[02:49:22] Um, just growing that, but yeah, we make boots.
[02:49:25] We make jeans.
[02:49:26] We make hunt, hunt gear.
[02:49:28] So American made hunt gear.
[02:49:29] I don't think there's anyone more patriotic in the world than hunters in the, in the
[02:49:33] country than hunters.
[02:49:35] Hunters need to vote like 30% of hunters vote.
[02:49:37] Oh, really?
[02:49:38] That little, we all sit around and are, you know, griping about this and that.
[02:49:42] They don't vote.
[02:49:44] If you're a hunter, vote, register and vote.
[02:49:46] No doubt about it.
[02:49:47] You can't, no doubt about it.
[02:49:48] If you're not part of the problem for hunting rights, for gun rights, for conservation,
[02:49:52] right?
[02:49:53] Like you definitely want to be voting if you're not voting right now.
[02:49:56] But they definitely, I mean, I saw a bunch of hunters over the past, you know, September,
[02:50:00] the past hunting season for me and everyone is just so excited about being able to buy
[02:50:05] stuff that's made in America because this is, you're literally taking money out of our
[02:50:11] economy.
[02:50:12] When you buy something from overseas, you're just giving that money, not only giving it
[02:50:16] overseas, but they don't care about the environment at all in these overseas factories.
[02:50:19] They definitely don't take care of their workers.
[02:50:21] Their workers have no future.
[02:50:22] Their slave labor.
[02:50:23] It's, it's, it's horrible.
[02:50:24] We are paying the Chinese Communist Party to oppress their people and plot against the
[02:50:32] existence of the United States.
[02:50:35] That's what is happening.
[02:50:38] And that's what me and my friends are doing to push back against that is bringing manufacturing
[02:50:44] back to America.
[02:50:45] I mean, you love it.
[02:50:46] We are literally, we have, have literally brought machines that were outsourced to America
[02:50:53] from America 30 years ago.
[02:50:55] We've bought them and have brought them back to America and are putting them to use.
[02:50:59] That's what we're actually doing it right now.
[02:51:02] I mean, we got, we got great documentation of this too.
[02:51:05] So that's what we're doing.
[02:51:06] Well, I tell you what, dude, let me get elected, keep working hard and then student official
[02:51:13] visit.
[02:51:14] Yeah.
[02:51:15] Well, because I listen, I will do anything to help the people that I'm representing.
[02:51:21] Those three conditions, morally, ethically and legally correct, then we got, we have
[02:51:24] to find ways that meet those parameters with the end state of your congressional district,
[02:51:32] the state and the country are better off because of it.
[02:51:34] Yeah.
[02:51:35] And it's, it's just a little nose to the grindstone, dude.
[02:51:38] We really got to think about what's taking place and then act on it.
[02:51:42] Yeah.
[02:51:43] Well, a huge part, a huge part of what you're talking about is, you know, you've said this
[02:51:45] multiple times, you got to put your country first.
[02:51:48] And you know, when, when, when I've, as I've gotten involved in the, in these industries,
[02:51:55] you can look back very easily in the last 40 years, 30 years really of the history of
[02:51:59] the companies in America where you can increase your profits, your short term profits by a
[02:52:07] little percentage and therefore you make this and oh, you know what, we can, we can, it's
[02:52:12] going to cost us more to get it over here.
[02:52:14] It's going to cost us to transport it.
[02:52:15] It's going to cost us time, but we got plenty of time because we're big and it's going
[02:52:20] to save us, you know, 38 cents a garment.
[02:52:24] Let's do it.
[02:52:25] And that's what they did.
[02:52:26] Right.
[02:52:27] And they did that over and over again.
[02:52:28] And then they spread the lie of not, not what they, what we were up against is they
[02:52:32] said, oh, you can't, it's impossible to do this in America now.
[02:52:35] Right.
[02:52:36] It's impossible.
[02:52:37] I was like, are you kidding me?
[02:52:38] This is America.
[02:52:39] It's America.
[02:52:40] This is America.
[02:52:41] We outproduced the world.
[02:52:42] Right.
[02:52:43] And we can build anything.
[02:52:44] We can make anything.
[02:52:45] And, and look, it starts with boots and clothing and jeans and jujitsu, geese and rash guards.
[02:52:49] That's where we're starting.
[02:52:50] I don't know where we're going to finish, but that's what we're doing.
[02:52:53] So we, we have a, we have a globally integrated economy.
[02:52:58] Right.
[02:52:59] It's carbon based and, and I'm okay with that too, to an extent.
[02:53:04] What I'm not is I'm not a globalist.
[02:53:08] And I understand that we need to make sure that we're putting the interest of our people
[02:53:15] first.
[02:53:16] And the best example of this is let's say your, you know, 98 year old person with osteoporosis,
[02:53:24] whatever, and you see someone being assaulted.
[02:53:28] Can you help that person?
[02:53:30] No.
[02:53:31] I mean, you can call police, but you can't get in there.
[02:53:34] So you, you have to be strong in order to help somebody.
[02:53:39] And this administration either doesn't understand that or they don't care.
[02:53:45] So when you are, the difference between equality and equity is everyone should have the, everyone
[02:53:55] should have the ability to start with a level playing field.
[02:54:00] You know what I mean?
[02:54:02] And then you, you succeed or fail predicated on your God given gifts and your drive.
[02:54:09] Right.
[02:54:10] But if I force you to perform less so that you have equity, vice equality, it ruins everything.
[02:54:20] That's Thomas souls.
[02:54:22] Brilliant.
[02:54:23] Yeah.
[02:54:24] We've been kind of exploring bringing him out to bring him on the podcast.
[02:54:27] If you do, can I come talk about him a bunch and he's definitely had a big influence on
[02:54:33] the way that I think.
[02:54:34] Equality of opportunity, not outcome.
[02:54:36] Yeah.
[02:54:37] Just brilliant.
[02:54:38] Yeah.
[02:54:39] Yeah.
[02:54:40] So echo.
[02:54:41] Yeah.
[02:54:42] What's up, man?
[02:54:43] You have any questions?
[02:54:44] Yeah.
[02:54:45] Let's rewind a little bit.
[02:54:46] Oh, oh, oh, you're working at a gas station.
[02:54:48] Yes.
[02:54:49] Did you have any roommates at that time?
[02:54:50] No, no, I was working at dry steel Chevron.
[02:54:52] So you could work at Chevron and have your own apartment.
[02:54:56] Granted, we're starving for sure.
[02:54:58] Wait, so check this out.
[02:55:00] You guys, do you track Dennis Prager?
[02:55:03] Yeah.
[02:55:04] Okay.
[02:55:05] So Prager, you, they did, you know, those series of four minute videos, they did this
[02:55:08] one.
[02:55:09] There's, if you do three things, it doesn't matter where you start on the lower socioeconomic
[02:55:13] scale, you're going to wind up in the middle class.
[02:55:16] You graduate from high school.
[02:55:19] You do not have a child out of wedlock and you have a full time job.
[02:55:23] That could be at the gas station, that could be anywhere, right?
[02:55:27] So you do these three things, statistically, you're going to wind up in the middle class.
[02:55:32] It just takes those things.
[02:55:33] And a lot of people give guff about intergenerational wealth transfer, right?
[02:55:39] Well, we were raised dirt poor, but my mom, because she was a hard worker, when she died,
[02:55:46] she had a home and we sold the home because we didn't want to live there.
[02:55:51] And then we had to pay a bunch of taxes and then we received this, you know, a little
[02:55:55] nest egg from my mom.
[02:55:57] That's money that went from one generation to another.
[02:56:01] That is intergenerational wealth transfer.
[02:56:05] And alls it takes, I mean, that's what it is.
[02:56:07] I mean, you don't get to make up the, I know we're seals, seals make up definitions of
[02:56:10] words all the time, by the way.
[02:56:12] Okay.
[02:56:13] Yeah.
[02:56:14] They'll change your name.
[02:56:15] You know, Jason, I'll say his name.
[02:56:16] Jason, Jason Gabel.
[02:56:18] Yeah.
[02:56:19] Okay.
[02:56:20] Jason Gabel.
[02:56:21] He was in Buds and they're like, were you in Buds with him?
[02:56:24] No, I was not.
[02:56:25] He's after me.
[02:56:26] Okay.
[02:56:27] So J bell is the same, you know, Jason, he was my, he was my LPO when I was at team
[02:56:32] seven.
[02:56:33] Okay.
[02:56:34] He just finished directing an episode of seal team over in Jordan, I think.
[02:56:37] Yeah.
[02:56:38] So we're buddies.
[02:56:39] I did him.
[02:56:40] He asked me, he's like, Hey, I want you to play an airships captain in a movie.
[02:56:42] I'm directing with Nicholas Cage.
[02:56:43] And I'm like, okay, I was working at the cafe.
[02:56:45] I've never chased acting before, but he called me because they're friends.
[02:56:48] I'm like, sure, I'll do that.
[02:56:50] So J bell, he's in Buds and they're like, get over here.
[02:56:54] And like, get over here cable.
[02:56:55] And he's like, it's Cabell and he's like, don't church it up.
[02:56:59] Your name is cable.
[02:57:01] So it's literally changed your, your name.
[02:57:04] So sorry.
[02:57:05] Yeah.
[02:57:06] Gas station poor.
[02:57:07] Yeah.
[02:57:08] But you had your own apartment though.
[02:57:09] Sure.
[02:57:10] I'm just saying it seems like here and here in San Diego anyway, if I work at Chevron,
[02:57:14] I don't think I'm getting my own apartment.
[02:57:16] Then move.
[02:57:17] Can you?
[02:57:18] Can you get a different job?
[02:57:19] Well, honestly, we, there's people that here that live here that work at Chevron that live
[02:57:24] somewhere, they have apartments or something.
[02:57:26] Right.
[02:57:27] But with a roommate or something like this, actually, you know, when, when guys are in
[02:57:31] the military here, especially they're young guys in the military, they're, they're, if
[02:57:36] they got a family, they're either having to live on house basing or maybe they go out
[02:57:40] in town.
[02:57:41] And a lot of them are on, on a wick and snapping all that stuff.
[02:57:46] So you have, so when we were raising our kids, and this is a, it's a choice that you can
[02:57:51] make.
[02:57:52] So Sarah was an RN.
[02:57:54] She's an ICU nurse and I was a E four, I guess.
[02:57:57] And we had our second child and I think I made E five by then.
[02:58:02] And we just looked at it and said, Hey, look, her economic earning potential is three times
[02:58:07] what mine was.
[02:58:08] But we said, we have these kids and we chose to invest in the children.
[02:58:14] You know what I mean?
[02:58:15] We stayed at home since we had our second child and we supported ourselves off a single
[02:58:20] enlisted person's salary.
[02:58:23] And we had, what's that?
[02:58:25] It's the wick women, infant and children, you know, like coupons to get milk and all
[02:58:30] that stuff.
[02:58:31] I mean, we were poor.
[02:58:33] But relatively speaking, you know, if you, you, you projected across the globe, we're
[02:58:39] still incredibly wealthy.
[02:58:41] If you look at that in perspective, and I think when the department of the army just
[02:58:44] came on and said, Hey, instead of paying enlisted people more, put them on food stamps.
[02:58:48] That's an issue.
[02:58:49] Yeah.
[02:58:50] Well, that's a way for them to save money in the long run, right?
[02:58:52] Which is not giving them, you're not raising their base pay, which means you don't have
[02:58:56] to pay the retirement as much.
[02:58:58] But Echo, what was your point in saying that like it's making the comparison, but you make
[02:59:03] a good point too, because, and this was actually kind of maybe a few years after that, I remember
[02:59:09] I had a roommate too though, but my portion of the rent was like 450 bucks or something.
[02:59:16] And I was making like 300 bucks every two weeks.
[02:59:20] So I was making like 600 bucks.
[02:59:22] Where was this here?
[02:59:23] You know, I, you know, I, you were living large.
[02:59:26] So your point is, were you moving, moving company?
[02:59:29] No, no, no, no, moving company for my first summer job.
[02:59:31] But you made good money moving, right?
[02:59:33] I was a part time bouncer at that time.
[02:59:36] You ain't going to make a bunch of money for being a part time bouncer.
[02:59:38] No, no, no, no, no, I'm just making the comparison with like how much you can make versus what
[02:59:42] you can kind of live off of and have your own apartment or whatever.
[02:59:45] And you know what?
[02:59:46] I'm biased.
[02:59:47] That's why, because I'm like, I look at like the apartment rent right now and it's like
[02:59:51] 3,000, 3,500, 4,000, 4,300 is what I'm hearing.
[02:59:57] You're saying it's San Diego.
[02:59:58] Yeah, exactly right.
[02:59:59] San Diego and in UTC.
[03:00:00] Yeah, calm man.
[03:00:01] There's places in even in San Diego, which is super expensive.
[03:00:06] There's places that are way cheaper than that.
[03:00:08] In fact, I would actually even say most places are going to be way cheaper than that.
[03:00:13] Definitely.
[03:00:14] In all of probably California really when you think about, I mean there's certain designated
[03:00:17] cities that's like, okay, it's crazy, but everywhere else is probably a lot cheaper.
[03:00:22] But you make a good point where it's like, yeah, I worked at Chevron, but then even you
[03:00:26] saying like, oh yeah, you're starving.
[03:00:28] It's kind of like, okay, there, that's kind of the deal.
[03:00:31] No one's really starving now.
[03:00:32] You know, everyone's got their phone and they got their this.
[03:00:35] I'm thankful that people are not hungry.
[03:00:37] Yeah, yeah, yeah, fully, but that's a whole different thing though.
[03:00:40] Then as far as like what I was kind of trying to compare.
[03:00:44] But I don't think we're way off.
[03:00:45] I think, I think it's kind of similar now.
[03:00:47] I think just now we're just distracted by way more things.
[03:00:50] But you also got to look at what you're going to accept and what you're going to do about
[03:00:55] it.
[03:00:56] Because I was in Iraq, we hit this target building and we roll in there and there's
[03:01:03] a family, whatever live in there and there's a bad guy and we got the bad guy and we're
[03:01:06] now we're like looking at this place where it lives.
[03:01:08] And in the, it was basically one big room and then like two smaller sleeping rooms.
[03:01:16] But in the one big room, there was the kitchen where they made the food and then there was
[03:01:20] like a, there was like a sink to make, to do dishes.
[03:01:25] It was the kitchen.
[03:01:26] Then there was a small bench or table to prep the food and then right next to that was the
[03:01:31] shitter.
[03:01:32] It was like, it wasn't, it wasn't a toilet.
[03:01:34] It was a trough that had a little hole that you would shit right there.
[03:01:38] And these things were separated by no more than five feet.
[03:01:42] If I moved in there within 30 seconds, I'd be assessing how we're going to do this different.
[03:01:47] What change we're going to make, we're going to make this thing better.
[03:01:48] We're not going to, we're not going to shit where we eat.
[03:01:50] That's just a general rule.
[03:01:51] We're going to make change.
[03:01:52] Now this family had been living there for a long time.
[03:01:55] And I noticed that wherever we would go, there would be some guys in the platoon that would
[03:01:59] be like, oh, we're moving into this building now.
[03:02:01] Cool.
[03:02:02] Here's what I'm going to do.
[03:02:03] They would make it work.
[03:02:04] They would make it work.
[03:02:05] They would make it work.
[03:02:06] They would make it work.
[03:02:07] And they would start making stuff.
[03:02:08] They'd start building stuff.
[03:02:09] They'd get everything set up.
[03:02:10] They'd get a fan from somewhere.
[03:02:11] They'd rig that.
[03:02:12] They'd make it work.
[03:02:13] Guys would just take action to improve their situation that they're in.
[03:02:14] And some people aren't.
[03:02:15] So if you're in an apartment and you're working at Chevron and you're starving, you go, hey,
[03:02:20] you know what?
[03:02:21] This sucks.
[03:02:22] I think this sucks.
[03:02:23] I'm going to go and see what the U.S. military, if there's an opportunity for me there.
[03:02:28] That's Derek.
[03:02:29] You know, I'm working at Wendy's.
[03:02:31] Guess what?
[03:02:32] This sucks.
[03:02:33] It sucks working at Wendy's.
[03:02:35] They have these fantastic potato wedges.
[03:02:37] Oh, believe me.
[03:02:38] I'm not knocking.
[03:02:39] I can't say I didn't really dig Wendy's.
[03:02:42] But I'm looking at it going, hey, you know what?
[03:02:45] This sucks.
[03:02:46] I don't want to do this.
[03:02:47] I don't want to do this for a long time.
[03:02:48] I want to find something else.
[03:02:49] Okay.
[03:02:50] What options do they have in the U.S. military for me?
[03:02:53] You and I both kind of look towards the military, but no matter where you're at, you look around
[03:02:58] and go, hey, you know what?
[03:02:59] Where I'm at right now kind of sucks.
[03:03:01] If you're thinking that right now, then you say, okay, why does it suck?
[03:03:04] What do I need to do to improve it?
[03:03:05] How can I start building in the right direction?
[03:03:07] But you know, when we looked at how things were being manufactured, the only way to manufacture
[03:03:15] something is do it over scenes.
[03:03:16] That sucks.
[03:03:17] Right.
[03:03:18] And my business partner Pete said, that sucks.
[03:03:20] I want to make stuff in America.
[03:03:22] Had to go and find a freaking loom and pull it out of an abandoned factory and get that
[03:03:25] thing working again and find people that knew how to work it.
[03:03:27] Why?
[03:03:28] Because it sucked and we're going to do something about it.
[03:03:30] It sucks that we couldn't get boots that we wanted that were made in America.
[03:03:35] Cool.
[03:03:36] That sucks.
[03:03:37] What are we going to do about it?
[03:03:38] So if you're in a situation that sucks, don't just sit there and grovel in it.
[03:03:43] Figure out what you can do to make some adjustments and listen.
[03:03:46] Are there hard times that hit people?
[03:03:48] Yeah.
[03:03:49] You know, that's a classic extreme ownership question that I'll get.
[03:03:53] Hey, I've been hit with this disease, been hit with cancer.
[03:03:57] I mean, I remember distinctly.
[03:03:59] I got asked this question at a live event.
[03:04:03] Woman said, you know, my, my, my child was a daughter, daughter has cancer.
[03:04:07] How can I take ownership of that?
[03:04:09] What am I supposed to do?
[03:04:11] How am I supposed to take ownership of?
[03:04:12] How is that my fault?
[03:04:13] And I said, no, it's not your fault.
[03:04:14] Obviously that your child got cancer.
[03:04:18] What you take ownership of is how you respond to it.
[03:04:20] Right.
[03:04:21] So, so I see what you're saying.
[03:04:25] So here is the, the, the nexus of personal responsibility and governmental control.
[03:04:34] So the government's job is to make sure that the playing field is level.
[03:04:39] And also we've gotten to the point where we seem to have demonized labor.
[03:04:46] So we have to not take away the dignity of labor.
[03:04:50] You know what I mean?
[03:04:51] Like I have a picture on my phone.
[03:04:53] I'm handing a young guy named Joey his first paycheck of his life.
[03:04:57] You know what I mean?
[03:04:59] He'll remember that 250 bucks the rest of his life.
[03:05:02] Raleigh Bevan's handed me my first check at a movie theater.
[03:05:06] I remember that.
[03:05:07] I remember the guy's name.
[03:05:08] That was 50 years ago when I ran up.
[03:05:10] No, 50 on 53.
[03:05:12] So 35 years, 40 years, whatever it is.
[03:05:14] I don't know.
[03:05:15] Right.
[03:05:16] So I remember Raleigh Bevan's doing that.
[03:05:18] So what is taking place in the United States of America is that for some reason we've allowed
[03:05:22] these folks to convince people that if you work with your hands, you're lower and you're
[03:05:28] lesser.
[03:05:29] So even for some people, they're okay with their circumstances by working at Wendy's.
[03:05:35] And we have to understand that it's okay if that's what you're going to do.
[03:05:39] But then again, if you want something more, that's the part where you've got to look inside.
[03:05:44] And I think that's what you're articulating.
[03:05:45] If you're not happy with your circumstance and the level or the playing field is level
[03:05:50] because the government is set conditions for everybody level and you're living in a place
[03:05:55] where you don't want to be, it's up to you to facilitate that change.
[03:06:00] Yeah.
[03:06:01] Well, of course there's people.
[03:06:02] That's another leadership question I could ask.
[03:06:03] You know, I got Fred and Fred, he comes to work from nine to five, but he's not motivated
[03:06:07] to do anything else.
[03:06:08] He's perfectly fine.
[03:06:09] Just just work.
[03:06:10] And I said, oh, you've got a great person then that's satisfied with where they're at.
[03:06:15] They're doing their job every day.
[03:06:16] They're working hard.
[03:06:17] It doesn't mean turn their turn your back on them and think, well, I'm never going to
[03:06:20] pay attention to Fred again.
[03:06:21] No, it means every six months you check in with Fred and you say, hey, Fred, I know
[03:06:24] you're waiting for kids to get through middle school or you're going to a lot of their games.
[03:06:29] Now that your kid left middle school, are you thinking about maybe moving into a leadership
[03:06:33] position?
[03:06:34] No, I want to wait until they're done with high school.
[03:06:35] Hey, cool.
[03:06:36] No problem.
[03:06:37] I appreciate the work you're doing.
[03:06:38] Are you familiar with the concept of the regimental corporal?
[03:06:41] Speak to me on the regimental corporal.
[03:06:42] All right.
[03:06:43] So in the British Army, they have something that's called the regimental corporal.
[03:06:46] Like in the American military, you have to promote, promote, promote.
[03:06:49] Oh yeah.
[03:06:50] So they have people that are corporals.
[03:06:51] Yeah.
[03:06:52] For life.
[03:06:53] Right.
[03:06:54] For their career.
[03:06:55] They are the best weapons technician in the world and they really want to do that.
[03:06:59] You know what I mean?
[03:07:00] And that's, it's not the English dream, clearly, but that's where that guy wants to be.
[03:07:05] So the beauty of the United States of America, and we got to get back this because we're
[03:07:09] getting away from it, is when you work yourself into a place where you're content, it's okay
[03:07:14] to be content.
[03:07:15] I mean, it's nice to be content, not complacent.
[03:07:18] There's a difference.
[03:07:19] So when you're content with your family situation, your school and your job and all that stuff,
[03:07:24] that's awesome.
[03:07:25] That's your American dream, man.
[03:07:26] You don't, you don't have to have a mansion in Beverly Hills.
[03:07:28] We've been just fooled.
[03:07:30] I have guys that tag me in social media of like plumbing installs that are super freaking
[03:07:36] dialed or they're putting an electrical subpanel and everything is squared away and they're
[03:07:41] like, yeah, check it out.
[03:07:42] Check it out.
[03:07:43] Hell yeah.
[03:07:44] Absolutely 100%.
[03:07:45] That's a trade.
[03:07:46] That's a skill.
[03:07:47] And that's awesome.
[03:07:48] I'm super stoked when I see that stuff.
[03:07:50] And that's again, one thing I'm very lucky is that, you know, I work with my consulting
[03:07:56] company, Ashland Front, we work with companies all over the country and all over the world.
[03:08:01] And so I get to travel into wherever North Dakota and go out and check out the oil rigs
[03:08:09] that are being drilled.
[03:08:10] The drill is the guys working, what they're doing.
[03:08:13] Those freaking guys are awesome.
[03:08:14] The linemen up in Michigan, you know, hanging wires, going through Wisconsin, yeah, in
[03:08:19] Wisconsin all over.
[03:08:22] And these people are skilled.
[03:08:24] They've got a badass job.
[03:08:26] They know that their job is completely me.
[03:08:28] They literally supply power to the country.
[03:08:33] Freaking outstanding.
[03:08:34] So linemen, right?
[03:08:36] I'm going around right off the Great River Road, Highway 35 goes along the Mississippi.
[03:08:41] I'll have the largest contiguous section of the Mississippi River of any congressional
[03:08:45] district in the country.
[03:08:46] Boom.
[03:08:47] It's beautiful.
[03:08:48] See this great house on a corner.
[03:08:51] Big garage.
[03:08:52] It's like a three story place truck in the driveway.
[03:08:57] This new pontoon boat with like a 250 horsepower motor or something outboard, you know, cost
[03:09:02] more than my truck.
[03:09:04] And so I whip in there because I want to put a yard sign in this guy.
[03:09:06] I go, Hey man, do you mind me asking what you do for a living?
[03:09:10] I went to trade school for two years and he had two kids and I can't remember his wife's
[03:09:18] name for Pete six.
[03:09:20] She was a radiology technician, not a radiologist, but she, okay, she went to trade school.
[03:09:26] So you got these two people went to trade school, graduated from high school and they're
[03:09:30] balling dude.
[03:09:31] I mean, they're living their American dream.
[03:09:33] They've got their kids in school and I'm like, why is that wrong?
[03:09:38] And you, you can't fix a toilet with the degree in 13th century French poetry and you just
[03:09:45] can't.
[03:09:47] So why have we demonized the things that built this nation?
[03:09:51] You know what I mean?
[03:09:52] You, you can't, you can't pump the air conditioning in this room.
[03:09:56] If you have a degree in communications, you gotta be a metal worker.
[03:10:00] You know what I mean?
[03:10:01] You have to be a sheet metal worker to make ducting.
[03:10:03] So one of the things that I'm doing Chaco is I consider myself and I think that the
[03:10:08] federal government needs to do more cheerleading like we have to cheerlead.
[03:10:12] I did a, I got endorsed by 16 in the 19 sheriffs of my district.
[03:10:17] You know what I mean?
[03:10:19] Because they know I have their back 100%.
[03:10:21] I, I've lived in ungoverned space.
[03:10:23] I'm unwilling to do that in the United States.
[03:10:25] How do you prevent that?
[03:10:26] You support the police officers.
[03:10:28] That's what you do, right?
[03:10:29] So I'm, I'm all in with these guys all the time and I'm also all in with people that
[03:10:37] are going to trade school.
[03:10:39] So we have to have people in positions of power go, it is so awesome that you are protecting
[03:10:44] me when I say, I tell them this, okay dude.
[03:10:46] So I'm a Christian.
[03:10:48] I was never afraid of being injured or killed.
[03:10:52] It was not part of my calculation.
[03:10:55] You know what I mean?
[03:10:56] I, for me, I've read the end of the book, seen the end of the movie.
[03:10:58] I know what happens.
[03:10:59] Even I used to joke, you know, with my wife about this and it was just kind of, she's
[03:11:05] a frog.
[03:11:06] Real funny.
[03:11:07] Well, she's a frog.
[03:11:08] No, she's a frog man's wife.
[03:11:09] You know what I mean?
[03:11:10] So I was never worried about that.
[03:11:13] What I was worried about was my family.
[03:11:16] You know what I mean?
[03:11:17] I was worried about my family and the most precious gift you can have from my personal
[03:11:23] experience in a combat environment is like a two hour nap, right?
[03:11:29] You get two hours of sleep when things are squarely.
[03:11:32] Why can you get that two hour nap?
[03:11:35] Because your brothers have guns and they're looking out and they're protecting you in
[03:11:39] your sleep.
[03:11:41] That's something I cherished and I still do.
[03:11:43] Who does that for my family?
[03:11:45] Police officers.
[03:11:47] That's a gift.
[03:11:48] And when people are demonizing them, they just don't understand that.
[03:11:52] These people are literally watching your children as they sleep to make sure they're not harmed.
[03:11:57] What is more honorable than that and noble?
[03:11:59] I don't know.
[03:12:00] Yeah.
[03:12:01] Yeah.
[03:12:02] Same thing with the guys and gals that are building our country.
[03:12:04] Yeah.
[03:12:05] Same thing when you flip on that electrical switch.
[03:12:07] Honorable and it's noble and things don't work without that.
[03:12:12] So the federal government needs to cheerlead.
[03:12:15] We need to tell people you're not, you're only here because these people are working
[03:12:19] so hard.
[03:12:21] That's why you could drive your car to work.
[03:12:23] That's why you're eating.
[03:12:24] That's why you have clothes.
[03:12:26] These are things that don't take these fancy pants degrees.
[03:12:30] I don't have an issue.
[03:12:31] I mean, I went to law school.
[03:12:32] You know what I mean?
[03:12:34] I get it.
[03:12:35] Higher education is very important.
[03:12:36] Graduate degrees are important.
[03:12:37] By the way, I finished my first year of law school and did full time congress.
[03:12:41] So I'm technically not a sabbatical.
[03:12:43] Which I'm...
[03:12:44] You may or may not get back to.
[03:12:47] Well, I'm going to have a greater positive effect writing laws than I will interpreting
[03:12:51] them.
[03:12:52] And again, I got into that.
[03:12:53] I went to that for intellectual curiosity, not to be perry-mason or something like that.
[03:12:58] Anyway, so that's the next thing I'm doing.
[03:13:00] Cheerleading.
[03:13:01] Check.
[03:13:02] Was that the only question?
[03:13:03] That was the only one.
[03:13:04] That's the only one.
[03:13:05] I was trying to make a comparison.
[03:13:06] Just drawing a comparison.
[03:13:07] Dude, you got to test him a little bit.
[03:13:08] You know, he's going to be up against the big dogs, the big tough questions.
[03:13:12] That's it for right now.
[03:13:13] How about that?
[03:13:14] Okay.
[03:13:15] Right on.
[03:13:16] Okay.
[03:13:17] Um, gosh, I, uh, I, again, I want people to be encouraged.
[03:13:24] And you know, how are you encouraged is you, you sit down and you, you practice, actively
[03:13:31] practice gratitude for what you got.
[03:13:35] And you understand that you are empowered to change your circumstances.
[03:13:41] And I know that because I was raised dirt poor in a single home, high school dropout,
[03:13:48] the whole works in jerks.
[03:13:49] I'm going to Congress next year.
[03:13:50] So if I can do this, you can do it.
[03:13:54] It's the same.
[03:13:55] I told you, man, I knew I could graduate from Bud's because there is a seal with a trident
[03:13:59] on in front of me.
[03:14:01] Right?
[03:14:02] Yeah.
[03:14:03] Means it's possible.
[03:14:05] So act.
[03:14:06] Right?
[03:14:07] It is possible.
[03:14:10] So act.
[03:14:11] Awesome words to close on.
[03:14:13] Thanks for joining us, brother.
[03:14:15] Thanks for your service.
[03:14:16] Well, thank you for yours.
[03:14:17] That code's really nice to meet you, man.
[03:14:19] Likewise.
[03:14:20] I'll give you my phone number.
[03:14:21] You can call me.
[03:14:22] I think you already got it.
[03:14:23] Well, God bless you guys and your listeners.
[03:14:25] And I just wish you the best.
[03:14:27] Oh, hey, where's that thing?
[03:14:29] Oh, we got a baseball bat.
[03:14:30] Check this out.
[03:14:31] So this, this was made by the three brothers back company.
[03:14:39] This is in Wisconsin.
[03:14:42] Got ahold of these guys.
[03:14:43] A couple of played college balls.
[03:14:44] It's actually four brothers and a sister, but they decided to start making baseball bats.
[03:14:52] So this bat is, it meets all the standards to be used in major league baseball.
[03:14:59] And these dudes have bought the Seoul building and started making these things.
[03:15:01] Yeah.
[03:15:02] So what happened with bats is I did like a, okay, long story on the bats.
[03:15:07] Here's the long story on the bats when I went to Iraq, platoon commander 2003.
[03:15:14] When did you go there for the first time?
[03:15:16] 2004.
[03:15:17] I was in Afghanistan in 2003.
[03:15:19] I was in Iraq in 2005.
[03:15:20] When you were in Afghanistan in 2003 was America sending a bunch of stuff over there just like
[03:15:25] care packages and like sunscreen.
[03:15:28] Still are.
[03:15:29] Okay.
[03:15:30] So that was going on.
[03:15:31] And for whatever reason, you know, the sun screen and like M&M just all this stuff and
[03:15:36] they would send baseball gloves and baseballs and baseball bats.
[03:15:41] So for whatever reason, we had a bunch of baseball bats.
[03:15:44] So we're living in a, you know, this was 2003.
[03:15:48] The war had kind of, well, this is the fall of 2004, 2003.
[03:15:53] So the war wasn't very deep.
[03:15:54] There wasn't all this infrastructure.
[03:15:56] There wasn't like a Wendy's on the base and everything like this yet.
[03:16:00] And so we were briefing in this crappy room with, you know, like a sheet hung up on the
[03:16:05] wall and I would brief, I would go and get one of the bats from this MWR, the morale
[03:16:12] welfare and recreation bucket, which had three baseball bats in it.
[03:16:16] That somebody, some cool person from America threw them into a package and sent them to
[03:16:20] support the troops, which is beautiful.
[03:16:23] And so I would walk over there, grab a bat and that's how I'd brief.
[03:16:26] And one of my friends has a, has a video of me briefing with the bat.
[03:16:30] And you know, that's just like how I would point to like, Hey, we're going to go in
[03:16:33] over here, we're going to move over there.
[03:16:35] And so then when I was a task unit commander, it kind of continued on that we had like a
[03:16:40] briefing bat.
[03:16:42] And then we did a video the other day and I was just like talking about leadership or
[03:16:45] something.
[03:16:46] I was holding a bat and I forget what bat it was.
[03:16:48] It'll be that one in the future.
[03:16:49] Well, in the future, it'll be this one.
[03:16:50] But then now a bunch of people, now I have, I think, I think I've received five baseball
[03:16:56] bats from various people, custom baseball bats.
[03:16:59] I mean, you can see there's another one right over there.
[03:17:01] I got a few of them at home.
[03:17:03] But yeah, this one is, this one's awesome.
[03:17:05] Made in America.
[03:17:06] It says deaf core pro model deaf 434.
[03:17:11] Three brothers bat company, dude.
[03:17:13] That is in my district.
[03:17:14] And that is another example of people saying I have got a good idea.
[03:17:20] There's, I'll tell you one, I got to get out here.
[03:17:22] There's weasel concrete, concrete company.
[03:17:25] Joe just died.
[03:17:26] Gosh, it must have been 16 months ago.
[03:17:30] Joe had like six kids and they had a house and Mary's his wife.
[03:17:35] And he's like, I got an idea.
[03:17:38] I got an idea how to make concrete this certain way to make this stuff and it's going to work.
[03:17:45] Mortgage is his house again.
[03:17:47] So you want to talk about risk?
[03:17:49] Homeless Wisconsin six kids.
[03:17:52] That would happen if you failed.
[03:17:53] But he's like, I have an idea.
[03:17:56] He died a billionaire.
[03:17:58] Yeah, because he was like, I'm sick.
[03:18:02] Check on the billionaire part.
[03:18:03] Not so much to check on the diet part.
[03:18:04] But I mean, if you're going to die, you might as well do it as a billionaire.
[03:18:07] Right.
[03:18:08] Right.
[03:18:09] So the, that's one of the things where people demonize business people.
[03:18:11] I'm like the hardest that I would say the wealthiest people I know are some of the hardest
[03:18:17] working people I know.
[03:18:19] And you know, that's their thing.
[03:18:20] That's their metric.
[03:18:21] As I started off, you know, I still do this.
[03:18:25] I collect relationships with people.
[03:18:27] To me, that is my metric of success.
[03:18:29] How many people do I know at what level do I know them?
[03:18:32] How can I help them?
[03:18:33] Will they reach out to me if they need something and can I facilitate that need?
[03:18:37] That's my metric of success.
[03:18:38] It always has been.
[03:18:39] Sarah Jane, I live on my enlisted retirement.
[03:18:41] You know what I mean?
[03:18:42] Cause we don't chase nickels.
[03:18:43] I just, it's not my thing.
[03:18:45] But if, if that, if you're a businessman, you're metric or woman, you're metric of success
[03:18:51] more likely than not is financial.
[03:18:54] So therefore, if you're doing this and that's the metric of success, you should be wealthy
[03:18:59] as a business person.
[03:19:00] If you're a doctor, you should be carrying people.
[03:19:03] So I'd love that about this job because I get to meet the most fascinating people like
[03:19:10] those dudes that made that bat for you.
[03:19:13] And it was an offhand comment.
[03:19:14] You know this Jocko guy?
[03:19:17] When did you meet him and when did they get the bat to you to bring it hand carry it to
[03:19:20] me?
[03:19:21] I met him right overnight to my mother in law's house.
[03:19:24] It was, it was delivered yesterday.
[03:19:27] So I talked to the cats and they're like, Oh, you know this Jocko willing guy?
[03:19:31] I'm like, you know, and they said it like, you know, cause apparently he's a big deal.
[03:19:35] I mean, I don't know this stuff, dude.
[03:19:37] Like I didn't know he had this.
[03:19:38] I was like, you don't know he has all this stuff because I started looking into it and
[03:19:42] you wrote all these books and everything.
[03:19:43] I go like, if you're going to accountant, you know, would you like go watch a movie about
[03:19:48] tax season or, you know, you wouldn't.
[03:19:50] I'm like, so why would I be looking into Jocko?
[03:19:52] I know the dude, he's an awesome cat.
[03:19:54] You know, why would I be following him around?
[03:19:57] So I didn't, but they're like that offhand comment.
[03:20:01] I go, yeah, man, I've known him for like 30 years, I guess now over T one, right?
[03:20:05] And they're like, you are kidding me.
[03:20:08] I'm like, no.
[03:20:09] So they follow your podcast.
[03:20:10] They watch it.
[03:20:11] I think that they've taken a lot of your lessons because they're incredibly squared away dudes
[03:20:15] and families awesome.
[03:20:16] And just their name.
[03:20:17] They have, you know, too many siblings to put it on a bat.
[03:20:19] That's why it's three brothers back company.
[03:20:21] But yeah, so that was made for you and I have one.
[03:20:25] It's in my office, which I think again, cheerleading for people is what that should be a primary
[03:20:32] function of politics.
[03:20:33] I mean, clearly you must write functional policy and translate ideas into action and
[03:20:38] you do that through written word advice again, like we used to do.
[03:20:41] But the rest is just telling telling people about other people.
[03:20:46] You know what I mean?
[03:20:47] If if if I could if I could tell you about all the people that I know and what they've
[03:20:55] done, it would just be an endless conversation.
[03:21:00] And to me, that means I am the most successful person in the world because that's my metric
[03:21:04] of success.
[03:21:05] Check.
[03:21:06] Awesome, man.
[03:21:07] Well, like I said, thanks for coming down.
[03:21:10] Yeah, appreciate it.
[03:21:11] God bless you, man.
[03:21:13] Thanks for thanks for the service of your family, by the way.
[03:21:16] And what the what the military wives and spouses for the bomb go through incredible, the kids
[03:21:24] that grow up, you know, without dads around without moms around, really, really challenging.
[03:21:31] So thanks to your family as well.
[03:21:32] And I'll pass it on.
[03:21:34] I wish you fair wins, fair wins, following seas and a lot of votes.
[03:21:39] There you go.
[03:21:40] Get them.
[03:21:41] All right, bro.
[03:21:42] Thanks.
[03:21:43] Cheers.
[03:21:44] Oh, one more thing.
[03:21:45] I forgot vanordanforcogers.com.
[03:21:46] On Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram, you're at Derek D. E. R. R. I. C. K. Van Orden O. R.
[03:21:56] D. E. N. And you're up on all those different platforms.
[03:22:00] You got a YouTube channel as well.
[03:22:01] I do.
[03:22:02] So we can you can explore.
[03:22:04] You got lots of 30 second clips on there.
[03:22:06] Those are your little ad spots.
[03:22:08] I do those.
[03:22:09] I also make these little videos and just try to explain.
[03:22:12] Where do you put your little videos?
[03:22:14] They go mostly on my social media.
[03:22:16] And then we also rip them over to YouTube.
[03:22:19] So it's all out there.
[03:22:20] If you want to get a feel, a better feel, if over three hours of conversation, if you
[03:22:25] don't think like you feel, feel like you know Derek yet, you want to get to know, you might
[03:22:29] know Derek, do you know Van O?
[03:22:31] Do you know Van O?
[03:22:32] Do you know D. V. O?
[03:22:33] All right.
[03:22:34] D. V. O.
[03:22:35] All right, man.
[03:22:36] Thank you.
[03:22:37] You bet.
[03:22:38] And with that, Derek Van Orden, Van O.
[03:22:42] D. V. O.
[03:22:43] D. V. O.
[03:22:44] What's going with?
[03:22:45] Yeah.
[03:22:46] D. V. O.
[03:22:47] D. V. O. has left the building.
[03:22:50] Lot going on in the life of D. V. O.
[03:22:55] Some pretty important themes throughout the talk, the discussion.
[03:23:03] And you know what I just realized?
[03:23:06] He was in that movie.
[03:23:07] Did you know he was in that movie?
[03:23:08] He mentioned it, but then we, and I like pulled him back to talk about something else.
[03:23:11] And then he's using the movie, the movie is called Act of Valor.
[03:23:15] I did not know that.
[03:23:16] Yeah.
[03:23:17] So he was, he played a scene in that movie.
[03:23:19] He was an interrogator and came in and he, it was pretty funny.
[03:23:25] He was kind of like just him, but being super aggressive.
[03:23:32] But yeah, man, what a dedication to jump back into this stuff and get after it.
[03:23:40] But um, hey, with that, appreciate everyone listening, appreciate the support.
[03:23:48] And if you want to support.
[03:23:50] You mentioned something real quick.
[03:23:51] Okay.
[03:23:52] Thank you.
[03:23:53] I was waiting for you to chime in with something or you're just sitting there looking puzzled
[03:23:55] all the time.
[03:23:56] I wasn't looking at the movie actually.
[03:24:00] And him playing himself, not much of a stretch, not a demonstration of range.
[03:24:05] You know, similar to you, you're acting career.
[03:24:07] Yeah.
[03:24:08] Pretty much the exact same thing.
[03:24:10] But you guys did mention something in passing, seemingly insignificant, but it stuck with
[03:24:15] me.
[03:24:16] You're talking about, he talked about the incident where he left his rifle and the
[03:24:19] other car and you know, and he's just has his pistol.
[03:24:22] And you said that's not going to cut it.
[03:24:24] No.
[03:24:25] Okay.
[03:24:26] Why is that?
[03:24:27] I mean, I can kind of maybe understand, but obviously I've never been in a gunfight.
[03:24:32] So what he's talking about is the enemy puts indirect fire on you, which is mortars,
[03:24:39] maybe rockets, rockets aren't really indirect, but, but they basically are, are lobbing bombs
[03:24:44] at you.
[03:24:45] The purpose of them doing that is number one, that could, could be just a singular purpose.
[03:24:49] Hey, we're just going to try and randomly throw some bombs at people and kill whoever
[03:24:52] we can.
[03:24:53] Random mortars, maybe we kill one or two Americans, but they could also do it.
[03:24:58] So when mortars are coming, you have to get, you have to take cover.
[03:25:01] So now we get the enemy can get you to take cover.
[03:25:04] So they drop a couple of mortars while you're hiding, they commence a ground assault either
[03:25:11] with a vehicle born ID.
[03:25:13] That's what they would do in Ramadi was, it was, it was very aggressive.
[03:25:18] They would, they would hit you with indirect fire as the indirect fire is hitting.
[03:25:23] They start laying down machine gun fire as the machine gun fires coming in, then comes
[03:25:27] IDs, vehicle born IDs, and they overran several, several friendly positions in Ramadi by doing
[03:25:37] that horrible.
[03:25:40] So when you, so he gets mortared and he had told the guys like, Hey, when you get mortared,
[03:25:46] give it a second, see what's going on, let it develop and see what's developing.
[03:25:51] But then as soon as it kind of stops, boom, push out perimeter.
[03:25:54] So then if anybody attacks, you can fend them off.
[03:25:58] So he's pushing out to set perimeter and all he has is a pistol.
[03:26:05] The pistol is not a good weapon for a gunfight.
[03:26:08] So, and that's really the part that I was wondering, like, it's, I feel like I understand
[03:26:13] it kind of, but the way I've heard you say it, and my friend Jeremy, he mentioned this
[03:26:17] one time we're talking, he was like, yeah, a pistol is no match for a rifle.
[03:26:21] I'm like, okay, see how you say it's not even close, like, why is that?
[03:26:24] Cause they're a rifle, you can just aim it better.
[03:26:27] You know, the range is, the range is 10 times as much.
[03:26:31] Yeah, like, like sure, you can shoot someone in kind of at 50 yards with a, with a pistol.
[03:26:38] If you're really, really good, anyone, just about anyone can pick up a rifle and shoot
[03:26:42] someone at 50 yards, like almost anywhere.
[03:26:44] But you can also shoot someone at 500 yards.
[03:26:47] So it may even be even more that, cause, cause really might be like 12 or 15 times more accurate
[03:26:55] and ease of shooting for a rifle.
[03:26:58] And then the impact, right?
[03:27:00] You know, the impact of a rifle round is devastating.
[03:27:04] You know, it can punch through body armor, certain levels of body armor.
[03:27:08] It can grip through a car, you know, certain parts of a car.
[03:27:11] So you're just going to get better penetration with a battle rifle than you are with a pistol.
[03:27:16] And what's funny is when I got to the SEAL teams, we used to use the, the MP5, which
[03:27:23] is a nine millimeter sub machine gun.
[03:27:25] A sub machine gun is basically a machine gun that shoots pistol rounds.
[03:27:30] So there's small, small little bullets.
[03:27:34] And luckily we went away from that because it's cool for literal close quarters combat.
[03:27:42] So if you're inside of a building, then there is some potential for it.
[03:27:48] Actually, I think that the, that weapon, the, a sub machine gun, like the Heckler and
[03:27:53] Couch MP5, I think he's a great weapon for like home self-defense because it's not going
[03:28:01] to penetrate through a bunch of walls.
[03:28:03] It's really easy to shoot, like really easy to shoot.
[03:28:06] So if someone, you know, let's say you want to get your wife a self-home defense weapon.
[03:28:12] Now look, she could also get a shotgun, you know, maybe a smaller gate shotgun, like not
[03:28:18] a 12-gate shotgun, but like a 20-gate shotgun.
[03:28:21] Pretty easy to handle, kind of a point and shoot scenario.
[03:28:25] So that would be one option, but I think a good option.
[03:28:29] Another good option would be a little sub machine gun that she feels super confident
[03:28:33] shooting.
[03:28:34] Can we shoot machine gun in the California?
[03:28:35] Well, this is semi automatic.
[03:28:37] Semi automatic.
[03:28:38] I don't know what the legality is on the MP5.
[03:28:42] Well, no, you can't have a fully automatic weapon in California.
[03:28:45] No, I don't think so.
[03:28:48] Without certain like criteria, criteria, they have some, the laws, the laws in California
[03:28:54] for weapons are really kind of ridiculous because all they do is they create a law and
[03:29:00] then the gun manufacturers create things that get around the law.
[03:29:05] And it's just weird.
[03:29:07] Yeah.
[03:29:08] It's like this weird dance.
[03:29:10] It's a weird dance, yeah.
[03:29:11] Instead of just being like, hey, look, this is what you, and it doesn't make any sense.
[03:29:15] The whole, I mean, look, you hear this stuff all the time about, what is it?
[03:29:18] Like what's an assault weapon?
[03:29:21] And what was an assault weapon is this type of thing.
[03:29:23] AR-15, assault rifle 15?
[03:29:25] No.
[03:29:26] It's because of like the shape of the grip, like a pistol grip makes it an assault.
[03:29:32] A muzzle suppressor, a flash suppressor makes it an assault weapon according to this weird
[03:29:38] thing.
[03:29:39] So instead of having a pistol grip, they'll like put this weird shape thing that serves
[03:29:44] the same function as a pistol grip.
[03:29:47] But it's actually not a pistol grip at all.
[03:29:50] But it is a pistol grip.
[03:29:51] It gives you the same function.
[03:29:53] They just do all this dumb, silly things.
[03:29:55] And then the gun manufacturers make something that just overcomes that.
[03:29:59] Maybe it's a little bit awkward or whatever.
[03:30:01] Not as cool, but it's just a silly dance.
[03:30:05] It's just like you said, it's a silly dance.
[03:30:07] Yeah.
[03:30:08] And when I was browsing, one of the guys there said something real, one of the main guys
[03:30:16] there, might have been the owner.
[03:30:18] He said something interesting where he was like, yeah, well, one of the main problems
[03:30:21] is the people who make the laws and even propose the laws, they don't know anything about that.
[03:30:26] So they, it's the mere conception of the law comes out of ignorance.
[03:30:34] Yeah, it's just dumb.
[03:30:36] It's just dumb.
[03:30:37] So it's one of the things about California that's just really bizarre.
[03:30:43] It's just bizarre.
[03:30:44] They make laws that literally don't make sense.
[03:30:48] Yeah.
[03:30:49] When they land, it's like, wait, what's the issue here that is solved?
[03:30:54] And they're like, this.
[03:30:55] And we're like, well, that didn't even solve it.
[03:30:57] It actually kind of made some more issues.
[03:30:59] And they made a lot of people mad who are kind of in the know.
[03:31:02] Meanwhile, I can buy a Dead's or Eagle 50 calibers, 50 caliber round.
[03:31:08] I can shoot with one hand if I want to.
[03:31:10] That seems kind of dangerous.
[03:31:13] Could be.
[03:31:14] I mean, depending on what kind of thing you're shooting at.
[03:31:18] How dumb you are.
[03:31:20] I'm pretty dumb.
[03:31:22] But yeah, yeah, that is that's interesting.
[03:31:27] That's good.
[03:31:28] Interesting to know about the pistol versus rifle.
[03:31:30] Yeah.
[03:31:31] Yeah, I didn't realize it was that much of a difference.
[03:31:33] Huge difference.
[03:31:34] It's almost incomparable.
[03:31:36] Probably because I'm thinking of movies, you know, how like, you know, lethal weapon.
[03:31:40] Remember?
[03:31:41] Yeah, well, well apart.
[03:31:42] I don't know.
[03:31:43] He was just really good at aiming.
[03:31:44] So he would be like, at what distance?
[03:31:45] I don't know.
[03:31:46] Oh, yeah.
[03:31:47] He shoots the smiley face into the target.
[03:31:49] Yes.
[03:31:50] Yes.
[03:31:51] Yes.
[03:31:52] That's really depending on what range that would be difficult to do.
[03:31:56] I think in the movie, it was far away, like pretty far shot.
[03:32:00] Yeah, he pushed it all the way back.
[03:32:02] That was kind of the thing.
[03:32:04] Yeah.
[03:32:05] So there you go.
[03:32:06] He said a lot of cool stuff, though.
[03:32:08] And you know, they I like hearing cool stuff like presented a certain way.
[03:32:14] But at the same time, I do like kind of like what it says.
[03:32:16] And when you think about it, you'd be like, oh, man, you know, I kind of dons on you.
[03:32:21] Like certain things.
[03:32:22] And if you keep your head down, you won't see the world around you.
[03:32:25] That's a really good point.
[03:32:26] And even metaphorically, you know, like if you stay in the house all the time or if
[03:32:29] you don't, you know, like they say work life balance.
[03:32:32] I get that that that's a thing or whatever.
[03:32:34] But let's say you don't see your friends or you don't, you don't socialize or, or you
[03:32:38] don't talk to a bunch of people as much because you're focused on this or that or whatever.
[03:32:42] You you'll miss out a lot of beneficial like beneficial stuff for you and your family, your
[03:32:47] whole goals, right?
[03:32:48] You can miss out on key elements of those goals if you keep your head down in all these
[03:32:54] two ways.
[03:32:55] When I was in my first SEAL platoon, we, my, my leading petty officer, he, he had this
[03:33:00] thing like he would want to go out party, right?
[03:33:03] And he would say, always go out.
[03:33:05] Yeah.
[03:33:06] Oh, you know, we're going to always go out.
[03:33:08] And I took that because I was like, hardcore, right?
[03:33:11] And we always go out, like always go out surfing, go out.
[03:33:16] Like there's a training mission.
[03:33:17] Always go out.
[03:33:19] Oh, always go out.
[03:33:20] So yeah, always go out party.
[03:33:21] Cool.
[03:33:22] Get it.
[03:33:23] I'm, I'm, I approve of that when I was younger, you know, now I'm older.
[03:33:25] I'm not so much supported that.
[03:33:27] You know what I mean?
[03:33:29] But always go out, always go on the mission.
[03:33:31] Always step up, always volunteer, always go out, always waves, always go out.
[03:33:35] You know, snow, always go out.
[03:33:37] Yeah.
[03:33:38] Always go out.
[03:33:39] So I kind of adopted that attitude a little bit, not only strictly with going out and
[03:33:45] party, this guy, one time he was super drunk and he's, I think he had to go to the bathroom
[03:33:50] and we pulled back into the barracks and Guam and he like gets out of the car and it's
[03:33:56] dark and he goes running across the, from the parking lot to the barracks.
[03:34:01] There was, you know, maybe a hundred yards of grass and he goes running and I'm just
[03:34:08] kind of walking because I'm not in a rush.
[03:34:09] And I think he had to go to the bathroom and all of a sudden he just like disappears,
[03:34:14] and then I just hear this, ow.
[03:34:18] Yeah, he fell in the hole.
[03:34:21] There's other, he's just like, ow.
[03:34:24] Yeah.
[03:34:25] So there you go.
[03:34:28] With that, we talked about some of the stuff today.
[03:34:33] Hey, Jocko Fuel, get yourself some of these go, new improved flavors.
[03:34:38] I am apologizing for the previous flavors.
[03:34:42] Comparatively speaking, the new flavors are just amazing.
[03:34:47] And look, with the old flavors, it was like, oh, you know, I got my favorite flavor.
[03:34:50] Don't really like that one.
[03:34:51] This one's okay.
[03:34:52] Yeah.
[03:34:53] Actually don't want to drink this one over here.
[03:34:55] You know, it's kind of that thing.
[03:34:57] Now no matter what, you can go party mix.
[03:35:00] Yeah.
[03:35:01] And you're gonna like them all, right?
[03:35:02] You can grab one, grab the other.
[03:35:04] They're all freaking tasty.
[03:35:06] So if you were a little bit maybe cautious or concerned before you tried me like, now
[03:35:15] you can just get right in there.
[03:35:16] Just get right in there and get yourself some go.
[03:35:20] Some Jocko go.
[03:35:22] Fully good for you, by the way.
[03:35:24] Which is a totally different thing.
[03:35:25] I was watching the show.
[03:35:26] A Netflix show.
[03:35:27] I don't know.
[03:35:28] It wasn't my show.
[03:35:29] My wife was watching it.
[03:35:30] My wife was watching the show.
[03:35:31] You're pressing.
[03:35:32] I'm in the vicinity of my aunt.
[03:35:36] They were making this scene of this girl.
[03:35:39] She was trying to travel.
[03:35:40] She was running away from some killers or something.
[03:35:42] So she was driving up to Maine, by the way.
[03:35:45] And she stops at this convenience.
[03:35:47] She's all disheveled.
[03:35:48] She stops at this and she's a disheveled character just to begin with.
[03:35:52] Like doesn't have her shit together kind of thing.
[03:35:54] She stops at this convenience store and just gets like in the scene.
[03:35:58] I see what they were trying to portray there that she's just like doesn't make the greatest
[03:36:02] of decisions in general.
[03:36:03] So like what did she get?
[03:36:04] Like chips.
[03:36:06] And like you know not a good not a sandwich or not a you know she's getting chips and
[03:36:10] then she gets an energy drink.
[03:36:13] And it was like a recognizable brand.
[03:36:16] And I was like hmm interesting how they chose that brand to convey this message about this
[03:36:22] character in this point of the story.
[03:36:24] Interesting.
[03:36:25] And I was thinking oh you know it's a brand you recognize you're like okay cool.
[03:36:29] They oh I recognize the brand on the movie kind of a thing.
[03:36:31] I was like oh that'd be cool if there was some jockel go in there right.
[03:36:35] But it wouldn't fit the air.
[03:36:36] It would not fit the scene.
[03:36:37] Exactly right.
[03:36:38] She had to be squared away.
[03:36:39] Squared away.
[03:36:40] She had to be legit.
[03:36:41] Exactly right.
[03:36:42] I thought that was kind of interesting.
[03:36:44] Bro without opening up a can ADCC you and I just went to the ADCC championship.
[03:36:51] Which was awesome.
[03:36:52] We'll do some kind of a thing about that.
[03:36:53] Little debrief on that.
[03:36:54] That's just.
[03:36:55] In the future time.
[03:36:56] But we had the ready to drink.
[03:36:58] Moke there.
[03:36:59] How many of them did you have?
[03:37:01] I had like one.
[03:37:02] Really I had like because I was there for two.
[03:37:04] How did you only have one?
[03:37:06] Well because I drank one and then it was like the next opportunity I had they were like
[03:37:13] Brian was like because he couldn't give him away or something like that.
[03:37:17] Something happened where they couldn't give away.
[03:37:19] You got scammed.
[03:37:20] Yeah.
[03:37:21] When they were like oh here they are.
[03:37:22] I had like five a day.
[03:37:23] I was there for two days.
[03:37:25] They're freaking so tasty and so good for you.
[03:37:28] Hey and this is cool.
[03:37:29] Good news.
[03:37:30] We have been having a hard time finding the manufacturer for it.
[03:37:35] We just got cleared hot.
[03:37:37] We just built that relationship with this manufacturer.
[03:37:41] We got millions of ready to drink milk common.
[03:37:45] It's delicious.
[03:37:46] Way better than other brands which you and I just had a little taste test comparison and
[03:37:51] it's not even close.
[03:37:52] It's not even close.
[03:37:53] And this is a big brand we tried.
[03:37:54] As a matter of fact my daughter Ranna did a taste test while we were at camp.
[03:38:00] Chocolate milk.
[03:38:01] Like regular milk.
[03:38:04] From a milk carton like ready made chocolate milk but not any kind of just chocolate milk
[03:38:09] that's just made to taste good versus milk.
[03:38:13] Chocolate milk.
[03:38:14] She picked it.
[03:38:15] My daughter Ranna does not play around.
[03:38:17] She's going to tell you what's up.
[03:38:19] She's looking at school.
[03:38:20] Yeah.
[03:38:21] She's kind of like offensive right.
[03:38:23] She's kind of like going to bring it.
[03:38:25] She kind of raised her eyebrows.
[03:38:26] She's like oh damn.
[03:38:28] Yep the milk.
[03:38:29] So we got ready to drink more common worldwide.
[03:38:32] Well not worldwide really.
[03:38:34] Nationwide.
[03:38:35] You'll be able to order it.
[03:38:36] So check that out.
[03:38:37] Jockofuel.com.
[03:38:38] Go to Wawa.
[03:38:39] Go to Wawa and just clean the shelves in there.
[03:38:43] Let them know what's up.
[03:38:45] The more you buy from Wawa the more flavors they're going to bring in.
[03:38:51] The more we'll open up that supply chain.
[03:38:53] So go to Wawa clear shelves.
[03:38:56] Vitamin shop.
[03:38:57] We got pink mist at vitamin shop.
[03:39:00] Right now it's the only place I think you can get it.
[03:39:03] We had to run that first run of them.
[03:39:06] Vitamin shop's been awesome.
[03:39:07] They got everything in there.
[03:39:08] So go in there and just get some get some pink mist.
[03:39:11] It's tasty.
[03:39:12] So we're at ADCC as you mentioned and I'm not going to say who.
[03:39:17] Actually I'm going to say who.
[03:39:18] It's my wife.
[03:39:19] She was like hey this pink one is good.
[03:39:21] This would be perfect with vodka in it.
[03:39:26] She said it.
[03:39:27] You know what you're kind of right because remember back in the day Red Bull vodka or
[03:39:30] whatever right.
[03:39:31] Like that was like kind of that was kind of like a death trap kind of thing.
[03:39:35] You're not doing the right thing with a Red Bull and a vodka and then drinking them all
[03:39:39] night.
[03:39:40] That's bad.
[03:39:41] But think about it.
[03:39:43] The pink mist might balance out some of the repercussions.
[03:39:45] It's not the right thing but it's not it's less it's less wrong.
[03:39:50] They're going with Red Bull and vodka.
[03:39:53] Yeah.
[03:39:54] It's definitely less wrong than that.
[03:39:55] It kind of balances itself out a little bit.
[03:39:58] It's not balanced.
[03:39:59] It feels it feels like a balance but it's a move in the right direction.
[03:40:02] Let's face it we're not going out and drinking vodka and thinking that there's that this
[03:40:06] is going to make it okay.
[03:40:07] Yeah.
[03:40:08] Yeah.
[03:40:09] But if it felt like a violation if vodka is kind of on the schedule which I don't recommend
[03:40:13] right it's not on my schedule at all 0% but if it's on your schedule and you want to
[03:40:19] mitigate the issues that you're going to have then it's not going to mitigate you going
[03:40:24] to jail is not going to mitigate a DUI is not going to mitigate you getting arrested is not
[03:40:28] going to mitigate you spending all your money on stupid shit not going to mitigate any of
[03:40:32] that.
[03:40:33] No, probably not.
[03:40:34] It may give you a little bit of a less hangover in the morning.
[03:40:35] We'll go with that.
[03:40:38] So there you go.
[03:40:39] Joggle Fuel.com get some of that origin USA.com just got back from my hunt.
[03:40:44] It's another one we should just do a podcast about the hunt lessons just but hey we made
[03:40:50] Hunt Gear remember I had said if the Hunt Gear wasn't ready I was hunting in a loincloth
[03:40:55] that was my plan.
[03:40:57] Luckily didn't have to break it into the loincloth scenario.
[03:41:03] Everything is freaking legit and it's just so so good to go.
[03:41:08] Super stoked the team from origin the team in North Carolina the team in Maine everyone
[03:41:14] putting that stuff together is just turned out freaking legit so stoked and everyone's
[03:41:20] kind of stoked man.
[03:41:21] Everybody that I saw that hunted was like hell yeah hell yeah.
[03:41:30] Thank you for making this in the United States of America.
[03:41:32] Yeah that's legit.
[03:41:33] Did you shoot anything?
[03:41:35] Yes I shot an elk.
[03:41:36] Hell yeah.
[03:41:37] I just saw the pictures.
[03:41:38] I just wanted to see what up.
[03:41:40] There's a lot and there's a lot of people this is a very tough year for hunting.
[03:41:47] There's been a lot of rain out west so there's been a lot of grass.
[03:41:51] A lot of grass means there's a lot of eating that means the elk are fat which means apparently
[03:41:58] and talking to hunters they're like well all that fat on the elk means it's harder to
[03:42:03] kill them because they bleed less the blood doesn't flow as easily so it's been a really
[03:42:11] challenging year.
[03:42:12] There's a lot of people that didn't get elk and it's been a tough year.
[03:42:17] I was very lucky very fortunate to get one.
[03:42:22] To score.
[03:42:23] Yeah and I'm at a point now I got four elk with four arrows which is kind of I told
[03:42:29] that to Leif and Leif was like dude you are freaking lucky bastard.
[03:42:32] I'm like I'll take it man 100%.
[03:42:35] So what did you do with the elk?
[03:42:39] What do you mean?
[03:42:40] What did you do with the elk?
[03:42:41] Eating it.
[03:42:42] Oh so you bring it back.
[03:42:43] Yeah yeah yeah of course man.
[03:42:44] Oh yeah you drove huh.
[03:42:45] Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay yeah I understand.
[03:42:48] Elks for dinner bro.
[03:42:49] Yeah I understand but you know I'm just saying does everyone like if you shoot it is that
[03:42:54] the common thing 100%?
[03:42:55] Oh of course I mean it's you know it's a few hundred pounds worth of meat.
[03:42:59] Yeah but I've heard of like oh they'll give it to the who you know what I'm thinking of
[03:43:02] this actually a few stories I heard in like it was in a different country.
[03:43:07] And then they give it to like the village or something like that.
[03:43:09] Oh yeah if there's villagers that were like starving maybe.
[03:43:11] In Utah.
[03:43:12] In Utah there's no villagers starving in Utah.
[03:43:14] Yeah yeah I didn't think so.
[03:43:16] But so we got the stuff made in America.
[03:43:18] OriginUSA.com if you want to support American company that's bringing like I told Derek.
[03:43:23] Is there anything cooler than buying machines in another country and that were sold to that
[03:43:30] country and bringing them back to America?
[03:43:32] Yeah the concept is pretty cool to beat that one.
[03:43:35] One time okay remember back in the day the little it's this little.
[03:43:39] Wait when?
[03:43:40] Back.
[03:43:41] Back.
[03:43:42] It's called roller racer.
[03:43:43] Do you remember that thing?
[03:43:44] What is it?
[03:43:45] It was like okay so think of a skateboard okay think of a hard bicycle seat but a little
[03:43:50] bit bigger.
[03:43:52] Bicycle handlebars on a half of a super skinny skateboard with a pivot and then the front
[03:44:00] of the skateboard.
[03:44:02] So you sat on it with handlebars down like this and you wiggle it back and forth and
[03:44:06] it would go.
[03:44:07] I kind of remember like seeing people on that thing.
[03:44:09] Yeah it was like a little fat as seen on TV scenario this is back in maybe 90 maybe probably
[03:44:15] before that 80s 80s anyway.
[03:44:20] So one of our friends neighbors had that and they left it out on the road.
[03:44:25] They lived right up the road so technically I didn't steal it but I just wanted to use
[03:44:30] it so I grabbed it and I used it for a few days.
[03:44:32] I was going to bring it back for real I for real I know likely story.
[03:44:36] This is not sounding good.
[03:44:38] It didn't bring it back but the plan was to bring it back at some point.
[03:44:42] So I was using it and then I just left it out in my yard that's how right.
[03:44:47] Few days later it was gone and then we passed by that house every day and I saw it back
[03:44:52] at their house.
[03:44:53] I was like oh they came in kind of took it back or whatever then the guy the kid in
[03:44:59] a good way like oh they grabbed it back no big deal or kind of like totally neutral in
[03:45:04] my opinion.
[03:45:05] I was like oh it's theirs you know like I wasn't going to return it yet I still want to play
[03:45:09] with it for a little bit but hey man it is theirs so whatever and then the kid confronted
[03:45:13] me about it.
[03:45:14] He's like hey you thought you were all slick huh and I was like what do you mean he's like
[03:45:18] yeah because you ripped off the roller racer and I ripped it off back.
[03:45:21] That's what he did with the looms that's what you guys did.
[03:45:26] Same exact thing.
[03:45:27] Man that was a reach.
[03:45:28] I thought it was cool.
[03:45:29] That was a stretch.
[03:45:30] How your brain works for the first time I've kind of started to ponder.
[03:45:35] Like how you got to that story from what I just said and try to connect them.
[03:45:40] It's the exact same thing.
[03:45:41] That's what I'm saying.
[03:45:44] OriginUSA.com get American made stuff we'll leave it at that.
[03:45:47] We won't we'll try not to lure out any stories of madness from you.
[03:45:54] Also speaking of madness jocostore.
[03:45:56] Jocostore is called jocostore.
[03:45:58] So you go to jocostore.com so you can get your discipline equals freedom shirts.
[03:46:02] We got a new one out standard issue.
[03:46:06] It's nothing standard about it.
[03:46:07] It's freaking awesome.
[03:46:08] That's this is the feedback I'm getting from the field but yeah it's a good one.
[03:46:11] Also we have the shirt locker which is the subscription service.
[03:46:14] Seems like you've been getting a little wild on the shirt locker designs.
[03:46:17] Yes and we're going harder even in the next few let's say the next three months are going
[03:46:23] to be kind of like okay I see you I see what you did there.
[03:46:25] We're very excited about the new design.

[03:47:34] I've written a bunch of books.
[03:47:36] Publish some books published by Holly McKay.
[03:47:39] Check that one out.
[03:47:41] And then you know the books that I've written.
[03:47:43] If you don't go to Amazon and put in jockel willing and then you'll see books that I've
[03:47:49] written and you can order some of them.
[03:47:50] You can order kids books.
[03:47:53] Before you even you know you know you got to get the oxygen mask on yourself first.
[03:47:59] If you go to Amazon right now to go you know jockel sounds like he's going I don't know
[03:48:02] what he's talking about here.
[03:48:04] Don't order the adult book.
[03:48:05] Get your kids that wore your kid books first.
[03:48:08] Get the oxygen mask on them then save yourself.
[03:48:10] So the opposite of the airplane.
[03:48:13] No it's the same in the airplane.
[03:48:14] No you're putting yourself first.
[03:48:15] Oh right yes okay opposite of the opposite of the you're right.
[03:48:18] So I could see how you could get confused.
[03:48:20] It seems like hey save the women and children first kind of a scenario but hey you can't
[03:48:24] save nobody if you're suffocating.
[03:48:26] You know what I'm saying.
[03:48:27] But if you're cognizant enough to order something from Amazon order the kids books first because
[03:48:32] you look your life is half over at this point.
[03:48:35] You know you got kids.
[03:48:37] You kind of already blown it.
[03:48:38] One foot in the grave.
[03:48:39] Right you're one foot in the grave.
[03:48:41] But your kids they got their whole life ahead.
[03:48:42] Might as well get them on the path.
[03:48:43] It's true.
[03:48:44] It's true.
[03:48:45] Let them rise up.
[03:48:47] My daughter was she she learned her time tables last year and then this year she's in literally
[03:48:53] the where the word could one mark.
[03:48:56] Same exact scenario.
[03:48:57] So but she learned her time table but she forgot a lot of them.
[03:49:00] So she's doing this other stuff.
[03:49:01] You know you know how you kind of need to know the time tables right.
[03:49:05] Same exact deal.
[03:49:06] She starts crying and all this stuff.
[03:49:08] She doesn't know her time tables.
[03:49:09] She's nine years old.
[03:49:10] She's all this stuff.
[03:49:11] I was like we read that flashcards made a boom right on the spot man on the spot.
[03:49:16] I said you read this whole book twice by the way and you're still crying about this right
[03:49:21] now.
[03:49:22] So you need these flashcards on the spot.
[03:49:23] We do we went slow as a lot of it was review shardy.
[03:49:26] But so I end up the wrinkles.

[03:51:11] DVO.
[03:51:12] That's what we're going with?
[03:51:15] DVO.
[03:51:16] You want to support him.
[03:51:18] Van Orden for congress.com and then on Facebook on Twitter on Instagram.
[03:51:25] He's at Derek Van Orden.
[03:51:29] You can see the guy's got a big heart and he's trying to help.
[03:51:33] I say we go support him.
[03:51:35] And it's certainly if you're in that district in Wisconsin.
[03:51:38] He brought me cheese bro.
[03:51:40] You see that?
[03:51:41] He brought me cheese.
[03:51:42] He brought me cookies which you ate.
[03:51:44] I sampled.
[03:51:45] Yes.
[03:51:46] You ate the cookies because we're not the discipline doesn't allow cookies over on
[03:51:52] my side of the table.
[03:51:55] Cheese curd which I have not tried before.
[03:51:56] Apparently I got to cook it.
[03:51:58] No.
[03:51:59] No, no, no.
[03:52:00] He said deep frying or something.
[03:52:01] Oh you can.
[03:52:02] Yeah, yeah for sure.
[03:52:03] Cheese curd is like you know what that is technically.
[03:52:05] Well you know my wife is from the Tillmuk Cheese Factory area.
[03:52:09] So we go visit that one every year when we go.
[03:52:12] But it's one of the final processes before they do another one or two processes to make
[03:52:19] actual cheese.
[03:52:20] So it's like the base.
[03:52:21] Does it taste good?
[03:52:22] It depends how you do it.
[03:52:24] That one does because there's like our regular cheese curd.
[03:52:27] Not really.
[03:52:28] I think that's us getting fried in a pan.
[03:52:30] That's what I think.
[03:52:31] Yeah I can see that.
[03:52:32] I have never had fried.
[03:52:33] Cooked somehow.
[03:52:34] That one's solid.
[03:52:36] It just seems I don't know too because he brought it in like a bag.
[03:52:40] I don't think it's supposed to be refrigerated.
[03:52:44] I could see how.
[03:52:45] He pulled it out of the bottom of like a travel bag.
[03:52:48] DVO was not forward thinking on his transport of cheese curd for Jaco.
[03:52:54] I think you might be right.
[03:52:55] For JKO.
[03:52:56] JKO.
[03:52:57] You know what I'm saying?
[03:52:58] Yeah not sure.
[03:52:59] But we appreciate it Derek.
[03:53:00] We appreciate it.
[03:53:01] We will try it out.
[03:53:02] We will see what's up.
[03:53:03] Of course that's Derek Van Warden on all those social media.
[03:53:07] And Echo and I are on there too if you want to follow us on the Twitter, on the gram,
[03:53:11] on the Facebook.
[03:53:12] Echo is at Echo Charles.
[03:53:14] I'm at Jaco Willink.
[03:53:16] Watch out for the algorithm because it'll kind of grab you.
[03:53:20] And thanks once again to Derek for joining us.
[03:53:24] Thanks for sharing some of those lessons learned.
[03:53:27] Thanks for everything you have done for America and what you are trying to do for America
[03:53:32] right now.
[03:53:33] We are here to support and thanks to all of our military personnel that have served and
[03:53:38] are serving.
[03:53:40] Nothing more important than what you do to keep us free.
[03:53:45] And we are grateful for your service.
[03:53:47] And thanks to our police and law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,
[03:53:53] correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all first responders.
[03:53:56] As Derek pointed out, you're the one that protects.
[03:54:00] You're the ones that protect our kids as they sleep at night and keep us safe.
[03:54:06] And we are grateful for your service as well.
[03:54:11] And everyone else out there.
[03:54:12] And we start off with some George Washington today.
[03:54:15] Close it out with little George Washington as well.
[03:54:17] He said to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.
[03:54:27] And that goes for life as well.
[03:54:29] And you take a guy like Derek up from nothing.
[03:54:33] And he's prepared for war his whole life.
[03:54:37] And I think he's going to be ready for whatever politics can throw at him.
[03:54:41] And for the rest of us, I think we also have to prepare for war because it's coming.
[03:54:47] And I'm not talking about outright literal war, but in some form, in some form, you will
[03:54:55] be at war for your health, for your business, for your family, for your community.
[03:55:01] War comes in many forms.
[03:55:04] So be prepared for it.
[03:55:06] And of course, the best way to do that is to go out there every day and get after it.
[03:55:14] Until next time, this is Echo and Jaco out.
