[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 347 with echo Charles and me,
[00:00:03] Jocko willing. Good evening echo. Good evening.
[00:00:07] Simply put,
[00:00:09] warn officer Nick Lavery is a warrior's warrior.
[00:00:14] Nick selflessly and repeatedly risked his life for his nation as comrades in arms and most
[00:00:19] importantly, he accomplished what our nation needed him to do every time he left our shores.
[00:00:25] Nick is a hero in the truest sense. Nick's chosen profession requires an immersion
[00:00:35] into some of the nation's most difficult challenges, often in demanding, complex,
[00:00:42] and especially uncertain environments. To answer the nation's call, we seek men and women who have
[00:00:49] the tenacity to achieve the impossible and the resiliency to do it again and again.
[00:00:58] Nick Lavery's story is truly an exemplar of that.
[00:01:06] And that right there is an excerpt from a book. The book is called objective secure and the book
[00:01:12] is actually written by Nick Lavery and the words in that excerpt were spoken by Lieutenant General
[00:01:20] Francis Baudette, who is the commander of US Army Special Operations.
[00:01:28] And the speech was given when Nick received an award for his service in Special Operations.
[00:01:32] And I think anyone that hears Nick's story will agree that Nick is exactly what the general said.
[00:01:42] He is a warrior who can absolutely accomplish the impossible. And it is an honor to have Nick
[00:01:50] with us here tonight to talk us through his experiences and share some of his lessons learned.
[00:01:57] Nick, thanks for coming down, man. Thanks for having me. I wanted to read a really quick intro
[00:02:02] so we could start talking, man. Yeah, man, let's do it. That's where I'm at.
[00:02:07] Yeah, freaking insane. Your life's been kind of crazy thus far. And we'll get into that. Let's
[00:02:16] start from the beginning. Normally, when you've spoken nine words, everyone knows where you're from.
[00:02:22] Pretty quick, yeah. Yeah. Boston Mass is where I claim home. I guess more accurately, though,
[00:02:31] is I'm a nomad of Massachusetts. I moved every 12 to 18 months as a kid all the way up until
[00:02:39] eventually I got to college. And that's because your parents were just moving around?
[00:02:45] Yeah, a lot of it was financially related. Both my parents, they had me and my youngest
[00:02:52] sister, real young, so struggling as young parents and trying to just grind it out with also my father
[00:02:58] trying to pursue his passion in life, trying to figure out what that is and go after it while
[00:03:04] he's got two young kids he needs to feed. How old was even your handiw? And how old was your mom?
[00:03:08] 20. And my mother was 22. That's like old school. Yeah. My sister's two years younger than me.
[00:03:15] So, you know, they do what they had to do. And, you know, I love them and respect them for it.
[00:03:21] But that part of the story, that movement is deeply rooted in a lot of what we're going to get into
[00:03:28] here today. Like those experiences, particularly me struggling socially, struggling to make friends
[00:03:35] and keep friends and being the new kid in school every year. In today's world, what's known as
[00:03:40] bullying, you know, back then wasn't as looked at as it is today. So, my resiliency started from
[00:03:48] the time that I, you know, was five years old and went to kindergarten. That thing, we were just
[00:03:54] talking about bullying yesterday as a matter of fact, because it is, we were talking about like
[00:03:59] everyone gets bullied, right? Well, at least back in the day when I grew up and you grew up, when
[00:04:02] Echogrup, we all got bullied. That wasn't going to happen because no matter what, when you're 10,
[00:04:08] there's going to be a 12 year old that's bigger than you. And when you're 12, there's going to be a
[00:04:11] 14 year old that's bigger than you. And when I got bullied and pushed around and shoved in the
[00:04:16] lockers and all those things, I kind of was just like, that's it. To me, it was just sort of the
[00:04:21] way things went. Like, oh yeah, well, I'm smaller right now. And I'm going to get knocked around a
[00:04:26] bit because I'm smaller. I didn't think it was that big of a deal. I don't know. It didn't like
[00:04:32] hit me in some big emotional way. I don't know. Am I dumb? No, you're just you, bro. You're just you.
[00:04:40] I definitely struggled with it more so than you did. Eventually, I became conditioned to it though,
[00:04:47] which, you know, took a few years. Then it became normal for me. I wasn't as understanding of it
[00:04:57] as the way you just put it. But I just, my mind was conditioned to deal with the pain and discomfort
[00:05:05] and embarrassment. So the effect was less and less and less over time. Early on, coming home with
[00:05:12] tears in my eyes just about every day of school. And my parents are doing their best to kind of mentor
[00:05:17] me and be like, you're going to be good. You're giving me some guidance. But then eight months
[00:05:22] but then, you know, eight months later, I'm in a new location and it's that's all over again. But the,
[00:05:28] I guess I never had that too because I like basically grew up in the same town with the same people
[00:05:31] all the time. Everybody knew who I was and knew who my sisters were, you know, whatever. So I didn't
[00:05:37] have to go into some new environment. So I never really experienced that. Yeah, it was tough. But I
[00:05:42] look back now, of course, extremely grateful for that. Because a lot of people, you know, they
[00:05:48] asked a lot of the questions, how'd you do this? How'd you do that? I don't typically just dive
[00:05:51] straight into that portion of the story. But if I extract this thing all the way down,
[00:05:57] that's deeply seated in that. Is there anything that you remember? Do you remember like one kid?
[00:06:02] Do you remember, you know, I wrote a book about bullying. There's a bully in their name, Kenny
[00:06:07] Williams, you know, who's just bullying. Do you remember any specific like things that happened
[00:06:15] where it really left a mark? I'd say the most clearest memory comes back was a kid who was
[00:06:23] maybe two years older than me. And he, you know, he would beat on me just about every day. And one
[00:06:29] day got dropped off the bus. He gave me an exceptionally good beating this particular day.
[00:06:36] So normally I come home, I wouldn't be like visibly beat up. And I would hide it from my parents. I
[00:06:42] wouldn't let them know how often I was getting like beat on. Because I even had this young person,
[00:06:47] I felt bad for them because they're struggling and they're grinding it out. I didn't want to add to
[00:06:51] their stress. Like we're getting kicked out of this house or moving to another house. Like they're
[00:06:55] working their balls off. I could see that as a young person. So I would hide it. One particular
[00:07:00] day there was no, there was no hiding it. Right. So I was like busted up pretty good, walked in,
[00:07:06] and, you know, my father got home from work a little later and the kid lived just down the
[00:07:10] street from us. So he grabbed me and like drugged me down the street and I'm begging him, like,
[00:07:14] no, no, no, let's not do this. You're going to make it worse. Let's not do this. That was in,
[00:07:19] I don't know, third grade. So it was probably, I don't know, seven or eight ish. I'm like, dad,
[00:07:23] no, he's like, no, no, no, we're doing this. No, you know, knocks on the door. And this kid,
[00:07:28] you know, his parents weren't all that put together, you know, father answers the door,
[00:07:33] hippy looking dude, but like big, hairy, hairy, big mustache, you know, shirtless answers the door.
[00:07:41] And here my father had some words where it almost went physical between the two of them,
[00:07:47] right on this dude's doorstep, you know, and the kid I was dealing with is behind his father.
[00:07:51] And he's now he's yelling at me about how I'm going to get it worse. And I'm like, this is not
[00:07:56] working out for anybody. Ironically, though, however, it did, I do remember that it did tone
[00:08:02] down after that. So it reached the precipice of confrontation, but it did kind of level things
[00:08:06] off a little bit. Yeah, that's, that's, that's a little bit crazy. You know, that's that's what
[00:08:12] the dad wants to do, right? Echo Charles, what that was, that was a real strong affirmative over
[00:08:18] there. Did your dad get into it? Back you up? No, no, but I don't know. I'm thinking like,
[00:08:23] every time like I hear a bully story, yeah, you know, I have kids and now they're small.
[00:08:27] But if I, you know, you imagine them coming home with visible damage, bro, oh yeah, you want to go
[00:08:35] over there and kill everybody. Like whoever was even a part of it. We had a kid, we had a guy at
[00:08:40] this gym. And he worked here. And he did sales. And but you know, he was he's kind of, you know,
[00:08:48] like a, like a loudmouth, you know, always poking fun, always, you know, that kind of guy. And he
[00:08:54] did jujitsu, the brown belt, you know, and he used to roll with my son and he would kind of like
[00:09:01] bully my son, you know, when my son was a little kid, he'd like, you know, maybe slap him around
[00:09:06] a little bit on the mats, you know, maybe give the noogies, right? And I remember one day when
[00:09:13] my kid was maybe like 10 or 11 years old, we're leaving the gym and I didn't like painty mind to
[00:09:20] it. You know, he would just get abused or whatever bullied whatever while I was training or something
[00:09:26] by, you know, he's trying to train and this guy would grab and rough him up. And one day we're
[00:09:30] walking out and and my son goes, Hey, dad, I go, Hey, what's up? And he goes, Do you think that guy,
[00:09:37] he's like, Do you think he'll be here when I'm like 20? And I was like, I don't know, but I could
[00:09:46] see he's plotting. Wow. I mean, he's plotting on this dude. So that guy doesn't work here anymore.
[00:09:52] So he's probably going to get away with it. But that's the kind of thing where you think like
[00:09:55] that left a mark on my kid, like, Oh, when the time comes, I'm going to train and I'm going to work
[00:10:02] and I'm going to be bigger and stronger. That guy will come back when I'm 20.
[00:10:07] How old was he when it happened? It was probably like, I mean, this happened for years. I mean,
[00:10:10] we've had this gym since he was since my son was like five. So this could have happened anywhere
[00:10:16] between the ages of five and 15, you know, like he was forecasting. Yeah, that gate down the road.
[00:10:21] But this was when my son was like 10, he was thinking, Hey, he was, yes, he was forecasting
[00:10:26] by the time I'm 20, that guy is going to be old and I'm going to be ready. My prime. I think
[00:10:34] he is about 20. He's coming. Yeah. That clock is ticking. I'm going to go to the book here,
[00:10:42] give you a little childhood background here. When I was around nine years old, my parents
[00:10:46] bought me a dumbbell set. It had pairs of three, five and eight pounders. I began constantly working
[00:10:53] out my bedroom. Eventually I got to an age when I could join a gym. No matter where I was living
[00:10:58] at the time, I would scout out a nearby place to train often, my oftentimes miles away. I would
[00:11:04] ride my bike there and back. The progress wasn't what I had hoped for. Neither did it have much
[00:11:08] of an effect on my social life. But the desire to be big and strong remained. I caught the bug.
[00:11:15] Mother nature eventually blessed me with a growth spurt, shooting me up over six feet five,
[00:11:20] and my consistent work in the weight room paid off. I introduced different combat sports and
[00:11:25] martial arts into my life. I was no longer picked on. And as my social skills also developed,
[00:11:32] I was no longer without friends. So you started getting after it.
[00:11:38] Yeah, I don't know if that connection, I don't know if that was a pre-planned segue
[00:11:43] with your song, but that's, I mean, that's perfect. Because I didn't have a specific
[00:11:47] dude in mind that I was targeting a decade down the road. It was really everybody I was targeting.
[00:11:52] But the grind began then in order to build up the confidence that I wanted and needed.
[00:12:02] And so when did you start wrestling?
[00:12:05] High school. Yeah, I wrestled high school for my first three years up until my senior year,
[00:12:11] which is when football became the only sport that I would play. Our head coach,
[00:12:16] head football coach was also the athletic director of the program. So I started getting
[00:12:22] looked at to play football my junior year by college scouts. So come senior year, he's like,
[00:12:28] not all you're doing in the weight room, it's football. You can run with the track team to
[00:12:33] help you with your speed and conditioning, but you are football 24 seven. And you were down
[00:12:37] for the cause on that, right? Absolutely. Yeah, that became my primary sport earlier than high school.
[00:12:44] And then I saw it as as a way to go to college because I was not an academic by any stretch.
[00:12:50] You weren't talking about doing the bare minimum just to be able to stay eligible to play sports.
[00:12:55] That was me, man. So that was my only route to college. So I was cool with that adjustment.
[00:13:01] When did you grow?
[00:13:03] I was a peanut. Most of my life growing up. I was a massive baby. I was born I was 12 pounds,
[00:13:09] nine ounces as a baby. And my mother, that's not a baby, bro. That's like a small child.
[00:13:17] Yeah, I said, I set the record at the hospital, which has since closed. So I own that forever.
[00:13:22] And my mother's, you know, she's a hippie and she wanted to have this natural birth process.
[00:13:27] And the doctor's like, no, no, no, no, you don't understand. We have to go in and remove this
[00:13:32] human from you because he will split you in half. So that's the route I took. And I was massive as
[00:13:38] a baby. And then I became really, really small. Like I wrestled at 123, you know, my freshman year.
[00:13:43] So little, I was maybe 5556 little guy. Damn. It wasn't till I think it was between my sophomore
[00:13:49] and junior year of high school that I hit this massive growth spurt. And I shot up like six inches
[00:13:55] over a summer. And my, my joints were all achy. And I had Oz Goods, what it was called my shirt.
[00:14:02] I had that going and I was dangly and awkward because I had gotten so tall, came back my junior.
[00:14:10] Yeah. And my football coach, all my coaches were like, what do we even do with you now?
[00:14:14] You know, because you're, you're growing so tall. But between that time and then the time
[00:14:18] I graduated those two years was when I shot up, you know, like over a foot over the course of two
[00:14:24] years. That's insane. It was wild, man. And it was even, it was stranger because in my birthday,
[00:14:30] September 1st, which is coming up here pretty soon, I went to school early. So everyone in my
[00:14:36] class was a year ahead of me. So I started college, for example, at 17 years old, was my
[00:14:41] freshman year college. So I was already like a year behind everybody in terms of my maturity
[00:14:47] and my puberty development. So even my buddies, once I had them, their voices are dropping,
[00:14:52] they're getting hair in new places. And I'm still this little squeaky mouse, right? You know,
[00:14:57] trying to lift my eight pound dumbbell set so I could stay, you know, one of the, one of the cool
[00:15:01] kids. So I was real late to the game with all that stuff. Yeah. That's why parents hold their
[00:15:07] kids back. That's a big deal, man. Holding the kids back so they're little dominators in wrestling.
[00:15:13] That's like the way, that's the way, you know, at least in California, kids are getting, kids are
[00:15:18] like 23. They're seeing, they're seeing your year, you know, you're like football in Texas.
[00:15:24] Oh yeah. It's the same thing. Freaking crazy. You see these seniors in high school with full-blown
[00:15:27] bids, like men, right? These aren't kids, man. These are men. Yeah. So you, so you must have
[00:15:34] started to like just completely shine in football because you get huge. I didn't get huge, like
[00:15:42] body mass wise until I was in college. So by the time I graduated my senior year, you know,
[00:15:47] I was a strong safety, but I got so tall that the scouts started looking at me for linebacker
[00:15:53] in college. They're like, you're eventually going to fill out that frame. We just need to maintain
[00:15:57] your speed and stack on some muscle mass to go along with your now new height that you have.
[00:16:02] So I was recruited to play linebacker and then the muscle mass really came around, you know,
[00:16:10] sophomore year college. I spent my first year in that summer just with the strength coaches
[00:16:15] and the nutritionists all within the program that we had at the school, learning how to eat,
[00:16:20] learning how to train. And that's when I really filled out my frame. So my sophomore year of
[00:16:24] college, you know, I was eventually around like 225, 230. Whereas if I was born in Texas, or if my
[00:16:32] father had half a brain and he had done what he should have done, right, I would have been more
[00:16:37] than likely D1 full ride playing on Sundays today. I blame him for my current lifestyle.
[00:16:43] Did they put you on like a straight up just dirty bulk? Is that the proper term?
[00:16:51] Wonderful.
[00:16:52] Dirty. I mean, I imagine if you showed up to me and you're a freshman in college and you weigh
[00:16:57] whatever 185 pounds, I'm like, cool, deadlift, squat and just eat. Did they put you on that?
[00:17:05] Like you said nutritionist, I thought the nutritionist at that point would be dominoes.
[00:17:08] Just eat everything.
[00:17:09] Just eat everything.
[00:17:10] No, it wasn't. It was more dialed in. I had a regimented meal plan that I would just show up
[00:17:15] to the cafeteria and just give them my name and then they would give me the food. But it wasn't
[00:17:22] just like pizza and like hot pockets and shit. It was like real food. It was just a lot of it.
[00:17:28] There was a basketball player named Manu Boal who played for the University of Bridgeport. He
[00:17:32] came from Africa and he was seven, 10 or something crazy. And when he got here, he weighed, you know,
[00:17:38] like some tiny amount. And I read some article that they were like, hey, they were just pizza and
[00:17:44] beer. Like we just need this guy to eat everything he can to just get a little bit bigger because
[00:17:50] he was too skinny.
[00:17:52] Yeah. That it's weird. I mean, we're in the generation where they know a lot about nutrition
[00:17:58] nowadays where even in our college where if they would have guys gain weight, it would be good.
[00:18:03] Good.
[00:18:03] Oh, no kidding.
[00:18:03] In fact, yeah, we had a program called Training Table where all the football players would go
[00:18:07] and they'd eat separate and it'd be different food. And it's all like good food. There's no pizza.
[00:18:13] There's no that kind of like chicken, veg, potatoes. Yeah.
[00:18:17] Yeah. A lot of potatoes. But that was really where I began learning about nutrition.
[00:18:22] And then I was seeing the effects as it pertained to me on the field. And that was where I really
[00:18:27] fell in love with training and fitness and, you know, continuing that through today. That was
[00:18:32] the foundation of that knowledge was at that point.
[00:18:35] And then so how did it go? How did it go in the football college career?
[00:18:40] It was good. You know, I played, I played D2 at UMass and UMass Lowell. And, you know, my first
[00:18:47] freshman year, you know, it didn't didn't get really any playing time. But I was still kind of
[00:18:51] growing and developing. SoftMoy, I started to play a little bit. And then junior year, I was starting.
[00:18:56] I say junior year because that's the way we normally break it down. But for me, it was like
[00:19:01] more like my sophomore year, 2.0, you know, because I wasn't in line with the credits I needed to
[00:19:08] stay on track to graduate in four years. Right. So, but my second or third year of playing ball,
[00:19:15] my third year in college was when I was on the field. And then my fourth year, I took a, I took
[00:19:22] a pretty nasty injury to my back and that ended my season a little early. That was your senior year?
[00:19:28] Yeah. So what year was that? That had been 2004, 2005.
[00:19:34] Okay. So where were you and what were you doing when September 11th happened?
[00:19:40] That was my sophomore year. Yeah. SoftMoy or my second year of school was not 11.
[00:19:47] Were you, is that what focused you maybe thinking about being in the military?
[00:19:52] Yeah. I mean, that was certainly the tipping point for me was that I started looking at it in high
[00:19:59] school around my freshman sophomore year and no direction. I skipped school one day. I went
[00:20:04] downtown Boston and I went with a Marine Corps recruiter. And I said, I think I want to be a
[00:20:07] Marine and he's like, perfect. Finish high school and come back and we got you. We got you, bro.
[00:20:12] I'm like, great. So I had like kind of an idea because I hated school. I liked athletics, but I
[00:20:17] was tiny. There was no future in that for me. I wanted to, again, I wanted to be respected. I
[00:20:22] wanted to be feared in a lot of way because I lived my life in fear most of the time. And the Marine
[00:20:27] Corps was the route to give me what I needed. He's like, cool, graduate high school, come back.
[00:20:33] Did he take your number or anything? I don't think so.
[00:20:36] It might be too far outside their window because they got to get their quotas and all that.
[00:20:41] At the same time, like when they, when you walk in there, it's like a going on to a car
[00:20:45] dealership. Like they're ready to take you. But I guess if you were like 13, he's like,
[00:20:50] come back when you graduate. Yeah. I don't remember any, any exchange of information.
[00:20:55] The only thing that detracted me from going that route was, was football, was athletics. So
[00:20:59] went to college, you know, kind of plan B. And then sophomore year was, yeah, that was 9-11.
[00:21:05] And then at that point, I struggled to stay in school because I was really angry and I wanted
[00:21:11] to be part of the response to that. I struggled to stay in school, listen to some, you know,
[00:21:15] family and friends and mentors and decided to stay in and grind out the rest of my degree.
[00:21:20] And then look at options to come in. Would you, would you get your degree in?
[00:21:24] Criminology. And then you, so you know you're graduating. What did you, what did you say,
[00:21:29] graduated? 2005? I graduated in 2007. Oh, no kidding. So yeah. You know, normally if you go to
[00:21:37] college for seven years, they call you doctor. Maybe they, it's just Nick still. So, you know,
[00:21:43] a lot of different academic probations and having to redo semesters, you know,
[00:21:50] it made it easy for me to be eligible for football because it's played in the fall.
[00:21:54] So all I needed to do was maintain, I think it was nine credits, like three classes,
[00:22:00] and just not fail any of them. If I could, I could fail all the rest of my classes after the
[00:22:06] season was over and I didn't care. And that was the route I took. I immature. I didn't, I didn't
[00:22:12] care. You know, I look back now and I'm like, man, you know, what if I just applied myself and now
[00:22:17] I enjoy reading and learning and studying, but back then I didn't, I didn't care. So yeah, 2007
[00:22:22] was when I finally received my degree. And then when did you talk to recruiter? So now did you
[00:22:28] still look at the Marine Corps or how'd that go? I looked at the Navy. Oh, okay. Graduated college,
[00:22:34] the war was still going on. Now Iraq is kicked off as well. So Afghanistan, Iraq are both surgeon
[00:22:40] as prime for someone to go in and get some. And I'm like, yep, here we go. So I maybe it was a
[00:22:45] week after I graduated college, I went downtown Boston. And in the same building, they had three
[00:22:51] branches. They had the Navy, the Marines and the Army and three separate offices. And I went into
[00:22:56] the Navy office first and I said, I want to be a seal. And I knew I wanted to be in special
[00:23:00] operations. I want to be right at the front of the fight. And the seals came, comes to mind
[00:23:03] really fast today as then of being the ultimate badass warrior. So I walked in and said, I want
[00:23:10] to be a seal. And he said, perfect. Let's get you enlisted in the Navy. And then you can request
[00:23:16] to go to Bud's and go that route. And I said, okay, thank you. And I left. And I went and talked to
[00:23:22] the Marine Corps recruiter and I got the same answer. When I went and talked to the Army, I got
[00:23:26] a different answer. They said, we have this program called the Special Forces Recruit Contract Option,
[00:23:32] known as the 18X-ray, which I'm sure you're familiar with, gets you straight into the
[00:23:39] Army Special Forces. You bypass the conventional Army, assuming you make it all the way through.
[00:23:44] The Navy recruits, the Navy brings in a lot of people that want to be seals that aren't going
[00:23:53] to be seals. I mean, a lot of people. And it's interesting that you were able to identify that
[00:24:00] that what they were offering you wasn't what you actually wanted. And there are programs. I'm
[00:24:06] surprised that there are programs that you get like a contract to go at least get a shot at Bud's.
[00:24:12] Those things do exist. When I came in, that's what I did. It was at the time, it was called the
[00:24:16] Dive Farrer Program. I have no idea what that means, but it was like, you are guaranteed
[00:24:21] an opportunity to take to test to go to Bud's. And I was like, yeah, cool, sign me up. But it
[00:24:26] sounds like that guy didn't even have that much to offer you. No, no. And I mean, if he had chances
[00:24:33] out, things would look a little different right now because I would have taken it. Because that
[00:24:36] was my goal. I was like, I want to be a seal. Boom. If he had said, hey, man, we got this option right
[00:24:40] here, we'll get you into Bud's within the first six months or whatever. Some kind of guarantee.
[00:24:45] I probably would have signed it right there. And then, yeah, he, man, that's weird. I wonder
[00:24:49] what was up with that. And then the Marine Corps, same thing. The Marine Corps used to be like,
[00:24:52] hey, you joined the Marines and you don't even get any kind of select. You're going to join the
[00:24:57] Marines. We'll give you a job. That's the way the Marine Corps, it's better now. But the Army has
[00:25:02] had that 18X Ray program has been freaking goldmine for them. Yeah. It kicked off, you know,
[00:25:08] originally back in the day. And then, and then it went away for a while and they turned it back
[00:25:13] on in 2002, you know, post 9-11, when the ODA was getting requested to do a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:25:18] So like, we need to, we need to get more quality candidates. Let's start this program back up again.
[00:25:23] Yeah. I don't know if you've heard some of the SOG guys, a lot of those SOG guys were
[00:25:27] off the street and straight into SF and they'll defend the 18X Ray. They'll, we're all eight.
[00:25:33] We're basically 18X Ray because they just came right in and went in and went to NAMM and got
[00:25:38] after it. So that's what happened. So you end up, did you even think about an officer program or
[00:25:46] was that just not happening? I mean, it sounds like your grades stellar. Grades were not stellar.
[00:25:52] It was offered to me. It was brought up to me by my recruiter, but the X-Ray,
[00:25:56] 18X Ray contracts, not an option for offices. So it immediately wiped that off the table for me.
[00:26:03] Also, my interpretation of what offices do back then was a little off. There's some truth to it,
[00:26:11] but in my mind then, officers strictly sat behind a desk and enlisted guys were the actual guys
[00:26:16] that worked. And I wanted to be a worker. I wanted to get my hands dirty and everything else dirty.
[00:26:20] I wanted to get into it. I don't want to be the guy telling the guy to do the thing. I want to be
[00:26:24] the guy doing the thing. And in soft, that's obviously not the case. But because the X-Ray
[00:26:32] option didn't exist for O's, that automatically made it a non-option for me.
[00:26:36] What did your parents think of this? My father essentially tried to ground me when I brought
[00:26:43] this to his attention. I was 24. 24, a lot of life experience. I graduated college and I called
[00:26:51] him up because I had done my homework. I didn't sign the X-Ray contract right there in 1998.
[00:26:55] I went home. I said, thank you. I didn't know what Green Berets did. I'd seen Rambo and John Wayne,
[00:27:01] but I didn't know what an SF-ODA does, what a Green Beret really does. So I did some homework.
[00:27:05] I was drawn to the mission. I was really attracted by the timeline. That's what ultimately made me
[00:27:10] pull the trigger. But once I did my homework, made my decision, I don't think I'd sign the contract
[00:27:15] yet, but I called my father and I said, hey, dad, there's what I'm going to do. And he's like, no,
[00:27:20] you're not. And I'm like, listen, dude, I love you. You're my best friend in the world. I'm not
[00:27:27] asking you permission. I'm 24. But as a new father now, my kids are also young. I can put
[00:27:35] myself in his shoes. He sees the news. He sees what's going on. He knows where I'm trying to go,
[00:27:38] and he's just scared for me, which is fine. But they were both totally against it to begin with.
[00:27:44] Now, you described your mom as a hippie. Is that like classic definition of a hippie?
[00:27:50] She's a free spirit. Yeah, she's a free spirit. She's got her stones and she's got her crystals
[00:27:55] in the bedroom. She's got some crystals. She's got a dream catcher over the bed. Got some incense,
[00:28:00] burning. Okay. She's in there. Yeah, man. She must have been really freaking out.
[00:28:05] Yeah. She's less than my father. My father's much more like rigid and objective and scientific.
[00:28:11] My mother was still kind of like, well, you need to, you know, you need to choose your
[00:28:15] own journey kind of thing. Oh, right. But I'd rather you not do that, but like, you need to be
[00:28:21] who you need to be kind of thing. Okay, we'll take it. I remember I just came home and told my
[00:28:27] parents, yeah, I just enlisted the Navy, you know, and my dad just looks at me, he goes,
[00:28:32] you're going to hate it. He said, you don't hate you hate authority and you don't listen to anybody.
[00:28:38] And I said, I'm going to be in the SEAL teams. It's a team. You don't know nothing, old man.
[00:28:44] Do you come from a military family background? My grandfather was in the army. My dad's dad
[00:28:49] was in the army for 20 years. My dad got kicked out of ROTC. And he says that the military gene
[00:28:56] skips a generation because my dad's not a very militaristic dude, but I was a real, I was a
[00:29:01] rebellious kid. So my dad was looking at my, but they were both like, cool, you know, get out of
[00:29:05] here. That's probably the best thing that could happen as you go in the military instead of
[00:29:09] staying around here causing trouble being an idiot, which I was doing a good job of. So
[00:29:15] rolled out and that was that. But I, yeah, I didn't, I just came home and told them I did it. So
[00:29:20] they were, I think they overall, they were like, this is probably a really good thing that this
[00:29:24] idiot's getting out, getting off the payroll. That's right. Let's jump back to the book here
[00:29:31] real quick. August 13th, 2007 was my first day in the United States Army. It began at the 30th
[00:29:38] Adjutant General Reception Battalion located in Fort Benning, Georgia. This is the first location.
[00:29:44] US Army basic training recruits arrived prior to the actual start of basic training. Its purposes
[00:29:49] to receive, prepare and train personnel for what lies ahead. While I am sure we were given some
[00:29:53] classes, the only things that I recall during my time at the 30th AG were doing paperwork,
[00:29:58] eating our three meals a day and waiting, a lot of waiting, most of which was spent
[00:30:02] standing in formation. We stood in formation for hours each day. While in formation waiting,
[00:30:07] for what seemed like an eternity, we would sound off with several mantras. The soldiers
[00:30:11] creed the Army song and the warrior ethos are a few that come to mind. At any point, a drill
[00:30:16] sergeant, a member of the command or any soldier in the formation would simply yell, the warrior ethos.
[00:30:21] Then the entire formation of soldiers would sound off with that mantra. This served two
[00:30:27] purposes. One, it killed time, even if it was only 30 seconds of time, it gave us something to do.
[00:30:32] Two, it ingrained these mantras into our heads. Basic training is the Army's method to break down
[00:30:39] an individual into human clay in order to then be remolded into a soldier. The same goes for
[00:30:46] other branches of the military. The verbalization of mantras is part of that process. The warrior
[00:30:51] ethos was one of them. The warrior ethos has four tenets. One, I will always place the mission
[00:30:57] first. Two, I will never accept defeat. Three, I will never quit. Four, I will never leave a fallen
[00:31:06] comrade. So it's welcome to boot camp. How'd you feel about boot camp when you got there?
[00:31:13] It was annoying more than anything else. I mean, I was physically in a phenomenal shape.
[00:31:22] So physically, it was relatively easy. How long was it between when you enlisted and when you left?
[00:31:30] Maybe three, four months. Did you shift your training to be ready for
[00:31:36] drastically? Oh yeah, drastically. Pumping rocks and yeah. So because I finished playing football
[00:31:40] around 2004, 2005. What did you weigh when you got done? What was your max weight?
[00:31:46] Playing ball, I would usually start the season around 250 and I'd end up usually around like 240
[00:31:51] by the end of the season. So I was done playing ball, still had more college left and I just
[00:31:57] wanted to see how big and strong I could get. I didn't need to be quite as athletic as I needed
[00:32:02] to be as a football player. So I got more into strongman and powerlifting type stuff. I was doing
[00:32:07] a little bit of boxing, a little bit of light wrestling, but it was mostly just like, let's get
[00:32:10] big and strong, which worked for me because what I was doing professionally was VIP security and
[00:32:16] nightclub security. So all my bosses liked a big yoked up dude and a suit at the front door.
[00:32:22] So it helped me with what I was doing for work and I enjoyed the training. So by the time I
[00:32:28] decided to, by the time I graduated college, decided I was going to enlist, I was close to 300
[00:32:34] pounds. Damn. Yeah. I mean, I was doing like 12,000 calories a day. I mean, it was just crazy.
[00:32:40] So there's no way I was in a condition to go to basic training. Does it take effort for you to
[00:32:45] eat 12,000 calories in a day? Yeah. It was hard. It's work. Yeah. I really disliked it.
[00:32:52] I'm like choking down chicken breasts and dry potatoes with a gallon of water. My strength
[00:32:57] coach is like, hey, this is what it's going to take. If you want an 800 pound deadlift,
[00:33:01] this is what you got to do. So I decided to enlist and, you know, I'm huge. So you're 300
[00:33:08] pound bouncer. Yeah. Did you ever get a test as a bouncer that you had any trouble with?
[00:33:16] No, not really. Not at that point, man. I mean, I can just imagine you're six foot five, 300 pounds.
[00:33:22] You wrestled like you must have been a real quick peacemaker in these scenarios. Yeah. At that point,
[00:33:29] man, you know, I was so comfortable with losing fights, although it'd been a couple of years
[00:33:33] since that had happened at that point. I'm the biggest guy in the room. I've been boxing since
[00:33:38] I was a kid wrestling, you know, some different martial arts. Like I was well equipped. Did you
[00:33:45] train Jiu Jitsu yet? No, Jiu Jitsu didn't come on until, until I got into SF actually. Did you
[00:33:52] know how to choke people? Did you know like a, did you know like the sleeper hold? Yeah, I knew
[00:33:56] about the rear naked choke. Yeah. I knew basic, I knew basic stuff. Like as a bouncer, you occasionally
[00:34:02] had to put somebody to sleep. Yeah. Oh yeah. And I, you know, I wasn't the most mature bouncer
[00:34:09] until I got a little older. You know, some of the places I worked, some of the people I worked for,
[00:34:13] their methodology was let's make, let's punish this person so that they don't think,
[00:34:18] oh, no one else thinks to act a fool in my place again, which I enjoyed. I look back with, you
[00:34:26] know, some regret hurt and some people that probably didn't need to be hurt that way. But I
[00:34:29] mean, that's just the nature of the business. I was in the way. I went about doing it.
[00:34:34] So big boy. Yeah. So your 300 pounds are almost 300 pounds. Yeah. When you enlist.
[00:34:40] When I decide that the military is definitely going to happen. Okay. And by the time that I signed
[00:34:44] the contract and then my report date was like four months or so after that point was when I
[00:34:50] started my training program. It was about a 16 week program I did. Where'd you get that program?
[00:34:55] Did you create it? I was working with a strength coach, same coach I work with today,
[00:34:59] actually one of them that I've been working with them now, you know, close to 15 years.
[00:35:03] He's so he put it together for me. And obviously it was a wild shift from flipping tires and moving
[00:35:08] Atlas stones to, you know, running, rocking dynamic CrossFit style circuit training. So I
[00:35:15] sliced myself down over about 16 weeks from, you know, 295 to about 245, about 50 pounds or so came
[00:35:23] off. 245, 65 is a big person, right? But I was just diced because I had so much mass on that I just
[00:35:31] sliced everything off. So by the time I showed up day one, I don't think this is in the book, this
[00:35:37] is no shit. Day one of bootcamp or basic training. Yeah, you're just a savage. I'm a 24 year old,
[00:35:44] six for five, 24 pound diced dude. And I'm surrounded by a lot of, you know, 17, 18 year old
[00:35:52] children who have never left their house before. And you know, you get your ass smoked right,
[00:35:56] of course, for the first several hours when you get there. After me four or five hours,
[00:36:01] they're just doing pushups and flutter kicks and setups, I'm like pumped up my muscles are like full.
[00:36:07] And then they do their tattoo inspection. So they strip you down into your underwear,
[00:36:13] and they just go person to person to person. And I don't think they're really searching for tattoos,
[00:36:17] I think they just want to see like your physique and like expose you and just make you feel uncomfortable.
[00:36:22] So all three drill sergeants are like surrounding you when you stand in there and you're
[00:36:26] underwear. And they're just like looking you up and down and just like getting into your head.
[00:36:31] Well, the tattoos I have on me, this is Latin for strength and honor. I didn't have a lot of
[00:36:36] these other tats on me at the time. So these, these stuck out. And they look at me and they're like,
[00:36:42] what's your deal? And I'm like, I don't know how to answer this question, you know,
[00:36:46] like, why are you here? And I thought they were messing with me. In retrospect, I talked to these
[00:36:51] guys late like years later, they're like, we thought you were like an actual like government project
[00:36:57] that was going on. Like you were creating a lab or something. Like they didn't know what my deal was.
[00:37:04] Because then they asked me about the tattoos. And I say it says strength and honor. And then they
[00:37:09] look up at the wall and it's engraved in the wall above the whiteboard. It says strength and honor.
[00:37:14] So now their wheels are really spinning. Like I'm some kind of an implant.
[00:37:18] You're from the movie soldier, bro.
[00:37:21] And I didn't pick up on all this at the time. Eventually I head drill instructor
[00:37:26] later on that evening came over to me and he's like, no, really, man, like, did someone send you here?
[00:37:32] I'm like, I can't, I don't know what's happening right now, dude. I'm trying to play the game,
[00:37:36] but I don't know what game we're playing right now. So it was more, it was more, I say it was more
[00:37:42] annoying and frustrating because I was babysitting kids and I was putting shod in my of my platoon on
[00:37:47] day one. Like, you're the guy, we're all going to leave for the night. You're going to make sure
[00:37:50] that everyone that's in their beds right now are going to stay in their beds. So I'm, I was literally
[00:37:54] chasing kids like down, down the stairwell that were trying to just leave for bedding. I don't
[00:37:59] know where they thought they were going to go. But I'm like dragging kids back to their beds, you know.
[00:38:05] It wasn't very like tactful with my approach. It was very blunt. Like get your ass back in your
[00:38:09] bed and stay down or else, you know. So that was like 16 or 17 weeks and pretty much that.
[00:38:15] Yeah, that's classic, dude. You're not a normal dude.
[00:38:20] That's friggin awesome. So you do, you go to basic and then you go to, you go straight to AIT after
[00:38:26] that? Well, for us as an 18X rate, you do the infantry program, which is called one station
[00:38:32] unit training. So they go basic and AIT back to back without any break. So it's boom, boom,
[00:38:37] right? Straight through. Are you just having fun this entire time?
[00:38:42] No, no, I wasn't fun at all. I was just like staring at the clock, like get me out of here.
[00:38:46] You know, like the runs, like the workouts, they weren't all that like stimulating or difficult.
[00:38:50] I was trying to play the game. I did play the game. You know, I wasn't like a rebel. I was like,
[00:38:54] Roger that I was a good soldier. I was just like, I want to get to the real work,
[00:38:58] which I know is at Fort Bragg. So like get me out of here.
[00:39:02] And then so you make it through all this stuff that you had a airborne school too?
[00:39:06] Yeah, go when you finish basic or AIT and then you go straight down the street to airborne school.
[00:39:11] Get your airborne shuffle on for three weeks. Oh yeah. Do some PLS in the sawdust.
[00:39:18] And then it's then it's to where'd you go? Sopsie. Did they have Sopsie up at this point?
[00:39:22] Yeah, then it was to Sopsie. And that's to get you ready for that's to get you ready for selection,
[00:39:29] right? Correct. You were kind of ready for selection. Oh yeah. Yeah. Were you in worse
[00:39:33] shape now than you were when you entered just from being in bootcamp and stuff? Or were you
[00:39:37] made able to maintain? No, I was I lost, you know, 20, 25 pounds in basic training, just because I
[00:39:43] didn't get I wasn't getting the calories I needed. You're they were starving you. Yeah, the freaking
[00:39:48] government project. Yeah, they were trying to cut off you. They wanted to tear me back down and
[00:39:55] have me sent back to the lab for for a refit. So I was in I would say I was in worse shape for
[00:40:03] selection specifically than I would have been if I had just gone straight to that without going to
[00:40:08] basic training. But it was okay because by the time I got to Sopsie and I got to break the stat
[00:40:14] Sopsie, then I could eat like normal again and I put some mass back on. So get back into more
[00:40:19] anaerobic stuff with some resistance to be ready for Sopsie. So I was I was good to go.
[00:40:24] And now Sopsie when you get there, is it starting to start to approach what you have in mind?
[00:40:30] Yeah, it definitely was. I mean, the way Sopsie was back then, I think it was five or six weeks,
[00:40:35] and you would stay at Fort Bragg, and then you'd go down to Fort Campbell on Monday,
[00:40:40] and you would train and be in Sopsie Monday through Friday, and then you would come back to
[00:40:44] Bragg for the weekend, and you would just do that for six weeks. And it was just a lot of PT,
[00:40:48] land nav, like not tying some SF history stuff, but it was mostly physical to get you ready for
[00:40:53] selection. Well, at the end of the first week, so it's Friday, one week, week one is done. And now
[00:41:00] I'm feeling like I'm playing the game with like, with like the big boys, I got SF guys that are
[00:41:04] now my cadrates and my first time being introduced to them. I'm surrounded by a bunch of x-rays.
[00:41:10] I'm like, okay, now I feel like I'm in the game. That first week ends, and our lead instructor
[00:41:15] comes down, he says, all right, check it out. The upcoming selection class has some open slots.
[00:41:20] So we're going to send volunteers, or we're going to just force those that are in the top 10%
[00:41:28] performance wise to go and it starts on Monday. I raise my hand immediately. I'm like, yep,
[00:41:33] I'm good. I'm ready to go. Like, let's go. My confidence was really high. So it gave me a
[00:41:38] weekend to just get my stuff ready, my equipment, make sure I had everything I needed, which I did
[00:41:43] because I was proud of Sopsie. So my Sopsie experience was five days. And then I was in
[00:41:48] an SFAS to follow in Monday. And how was how was that selection?
[00:41:54] Selection when I went through was was 14 days long. Now it's back to 20 or so. It was 2021 for a
[00:42:02] long time. And then mine was the second class after they condensed it down into 14. I can't tell you
[00:42:09] why they did that. But you would think that that meant they removed like five or six days worth of
[00:42:13] stuff, but they didn't. They just rammed it into a shorter window. So there was no like white space
[00:42:20] in between stuff. Everything was just it was much more intense, because you still had to check all
[00:42:24] these blocks, but just in a week, less of time. What percentage of attrition comes from that
[00:42:32] selection? Yeah, so the time I went, we started with around 300 or so candidates. And around 100
[00:42:42] made it to the end. And then they selected around 40 or so. God, see, that seems like a freaking
[00:42:52] crazy roll of the dice. If you're joining the army to be a SF guy, that you can go through the
[00:42:58] training and they can just be like, yeah, you're not what we're looking for. Is that what it is?
[00:43:03] Yeah, I mean, they, you know, I have some buddies that are selection cadre now and some that have
[00:43:08] been and now are back to the unit. You know, they make it as objective as I think they can, but
[00:43:13] it's open to subjectivity because there are human beings that are evaluating you. And when,
[00:43:17] if you're looking at purely physical capability, like how fast did you run two miles? That's
[00:43:23] subjective. How many pushups can you do pull ups, whatever. But when you're evaluating people for
[00:43:28] leadership and their ability to work in a team dynamic, that gets subjective pretty quick. So
[00:43:33] it is a roll of the dice to a degree because you may just have a bad, may have a bad day or bad week.
[00:43:39] You're a solid leader, you're a solid performer, you just didn't perform when you needed to. And
[00:43:43] that's what the cadre had to go off of. So yeah, you didn't make this round, but come back and try
[00:43:49] again. How long do you have to wait before you can come back and try it in? I think it's, I want to
[00:43:55] say it's like six months. No, it's not too bad. I think it's like six months. Were there guys that
[00:44:00] you thought were like, oh, that guy seems like good to go and he didn't make it, didn't get selected.
[00:44:04] Yeah. Yeah, a few, a few of my buddies that were actually in basic with me that made it all the
[00:44:10] way to Sobsi that came with me with that first chunk because there were like 10 of us that left
[00:44:15] Sobsi early. They maybe five of us got selected that first class. And the other five I would have
[00:44:20] said, no, no, these guys are, these guys are going to be good to go. I was mostly looking at their
[00:44:24] physical performance, like their rock times and their pull ups and they're like, these were physical
[00:44:28] studs. But for whatever reason, they just didn't, they display what they needed to do.
[00:44:34] Do the cadre debrief a guy and be like, Hey, man, you were definitely not in the
[00:44:37] game over here. You felt short. Look like you had a big ego. Do they debrief guys?
[00:44:42] No, damn. No, it's the cadre during selection are like robots. They're not, they're not in your
[00:44:50] face. They're not screaming and yelling. There's a couple of times that they're screaming and yelling.
[00:44:53] Log and rifle PT are two iterations where they are in your face and screaming and trying to crack you
[00:45:00] physically and emotionally, mentally. But the rest, they're like cyborgs. It's very just,
[00:45:06] here's where you this is your task. This is your condition. This is your standard. Do you have
[00:45:10] any questions? Execute. That's it. And if you, if you don't make it, they're like, okay, go over there.
[00:45:14] There's nothing. They're not trying to, they're not trying to get you to quit. And they're also not
[00:45:20] that a tell you why you don't get picked up or why you failed an event. They're like cyborgs.
[00:45:29] That's wild. Cause it seems like in buds, really the whole first phase is to weed people out,
[00:45:36] but most of it happens the first, second, third, fourth week, the fourth week is the fourth or
[00:45:40] fifth week, depending is, is hell week, you know, and they'll get rid of so many people. But, uh,
[00:45:46] uh, yeah, that objectivity, I guess it happens a little bit different in buds, you know, like the
[00:45:52] instructors will see someone that's weak and they'll kind of like, they'll start working on them and
[00:45:58] they'll just break him. And that'll be that. Um, was there anything that was a challenge for you
[00:46:06] in this stuff? Cause you're like a freaking government experiment. Was there anything that
[00:46:11] was hard for you in selection? Yeah. Selection was certainly challenging. Um, I think what I
[00:46:16] struggled most with was the team dynamic aspect. Although I grew up playing team sports, you
[00:46:23] know, you, you get put in these, in these scenarios where you have a mission to execute as a small
[00:46:28] group and they'll rotate who's in charge, you're in charge of this, you're in charge of that.
[00:46:33] And that's where they're assessing you as leaders, but they're also assessing
[00:46:36] everyone else as a team player and their ability to support a leader, right?
[00:46:42] To kind of lead up the chain of command kind of philosophy. Well, as an aggressive,
[00:46:49] younger person, as if a leader made a decision on how we're going to execute something and I
[00:46:54] didn't agree with it. I made that note. I'm like, no, that's, that's not going to work. Like I wanted
[00:46:59] to win. And these tasks that they're given to us, they're essentially impossible. Like within the
[00:47:05] standards that are given to you, there's no way it's happening. They know that it's not about,
[00:47:09] can you get from A to B in the lot of time? It's about how do you work together as a unit?
[00:47:13] How do you lead? How do you communicate? How do you problem solve? How do you deal with stress?
[00:47:17] That's what they're looking at. I wanted to win. And if homeboy came back with some like crazy,
[00:47:22] ridiculous strategy that I knew wouldn't work, I let him know that I'm like, no, no, no, that's not
[00:47:26] going to work. And now this dude's in like a tough spot. He's like dealing with someone who's like
[00:47:30] bigger than him and angrier than him. And he's trying to do his job as a leader. And of course,
[00:47:36] he's being evaluated, the cashier standing right there. So I could have done a better job
[00:47:41] of being a supportive member of the team. I didn't have the same leadership philosophy and
[00:47:48] methodology and tools that I have now. So I struggled with that because even in the moments,
[00:47:53] I could tell like, I'm not handling this very well, but I want to win. And it's just, it's
[00:47:59] superseded my ability to stay calm and tactful. Did they debrief you on that or you just figured
[00:48:04] this out later? No, they did. So if you get selected, you sit down with a cadre after and
[00:48:09] they go through your entire, your entire packet with all your scores and all their inputs. So that
[00:48:15] was the number one thing that that was told to me was you need to learn how to be more supportive
[00:48:21] of a leader. That's legit. Yeah. Give you some legit feedback. And you, were you humble enough to
[00:48:29] understand that at the time? I was humble enough to accept it. I didn't have the same mentality
[00:48:36] towards leadership then as I do now, where now I look as leadership as very much a skill. Like,
[00:48:42] it's something that you can learn, but you have to deliberately train on it. Back then, even, even
[00:48:47] at that point, so I'm now 25, I just got selected, whatever. I still looked at leadership as, as a
[00:48:53] talent as something that you either had or didn't have. And that was it. So I just took it like,
[00:48:59] Roger that, Sergeant, I appreciate it. But like, this is who I am. And I don't have the leadership
[00:49:05] like skill ingrained in me genetically, I just don't have it. So I'm gonna have to get better
[00:49:10] other ways to kind of make up the difference. Now I look, you know, my mentality towards it is wildly
[00:49:15] different. Yeah. No, that's a, that's a, a lot of people make that, or a lot of people have that
[00:49:20] attitude. And, you know, at, we have a leadership consulting company and explaining to people that
[00:49:24] they can actually learn skills, just like, I guess, at the example I was used as playing guitar or
[00:49:30] shooting baskets and basketball, like you can't just pick up a basketball and be think you can make
[00:49:34] free throws. It's like not happening. You can't pick up a guitar and just think you're going to be
[00:49:37] able to play. You get skill and leadership is the same way. And are there some people that have a
[00:49:42] little bit of a tendency that have better hand-eye coordination that they're going to be able to pick
[00:49:46] up basketball a little bit quicker? Yeah. Are there people that have a certain ability to recognize
[00:49:51] different notes when they hear them? Yeah. That's an actual thing you can be born with. But regardless,
[00:49:57] you still need to learn the skills in order to get good at it. Leadership's the same way. You're
[00:50:01] going to have some natural propensity for it. There's going to be some parts of it you'll be
[00:50:04] good at. There's going to be some parts you'll suck at. You take advantage of the ones you're good
[00:50:08] at. You work on the ones you're not. But it's definitely everyone can get better unless they're
[00:50:13] a person that says, I already know everything. Right. And then they're going to be a problem.
[00:50:18] So then it's off to Q-course after that? Yep. Get selected, go into Q-course. And back then,
[00:50:24] it's different today. But back then, you go through these different phases, phase one,
[00:50:28] two, three, four. And in between those, you would just be waiting at Fort Bragg for there to be
[00:50:34] enough students that they could lump together to start the next phase. So a lot of white space in
[00:50:39] between. You know, phase one, you go to Down to Camp McCall, you're there for three weeks, seven
[00:50:44] weeks, whatever. Come back to Bragg and reset. Well, sometimes those breaks could be a month or
[00:50:50] three months. Right. What do you do during those breaks? Just working out? PT formations. They do
[00:50:56] like some LPD stuff with some of the tax that were back there at Bragg, the guys that were like in
[00:51:01] charge of us keeping accountability. So we do some like leadership type classes. But you were
[00:51:06] mostly just hanging out waiting, trying to stay out of trouble. And that's where actually a lot
[00:51:10] of guys, that's the reason why they're not green berets today is because of that downtime.
[00:51:15] You know, there's plenty of distractions in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
[00:51:17] God. Plenty. There's plenty. They're all actually, they're all there. All the vices and distractions
[00:51:22] that you could want or hope didn't exist. They're all there. Girls, drugs, booze, nightlife, fights.
[00:51:29] That is what got a lot of guys removed from the program because they just couldn't stay focused
[00:51:35] for that amount of time because it took me just the Q course alone about 18 months.
[00:51:42] Oh, no kidding. To get through it. Yeah. And how much of that time was it?
[00:51:46] Maybe just just, yeah. How much was actually training? Maybe 12. Wow. Yeah. Well, when you were
[00:51:52] going through that, was there anything that was trouble for you in there? Language school. Real
[00:51:57] hot. Yeah. Yeah. Language school is hot. What language did you learn? I learned Russian in the
[00:52:03] Q course, which was six months long. Do they have Rs in Russian? They have the Rs sound in Russian?
[00:52:08] They do, but I don't pass a shit. You talk about a confusing accent. You mix Russian and Boston
[00:52:14] together. Literally no one knows what I'm saying, including me. So everyone's left lost. What did
[00:52:20] you just say? I don't think I even know. That was tough. How long was the Russian course? Six months.
[00:52:28] And that's all you do. Eight hours a day. Headset on. Freakin. They don't speak English to you.
[00:52:33] We got instructors. So you're in a classroom with like six, seven other guys. Eight hours a day,
[00:52:39] just learning Russian. And it was even worse because we still to maintain our jump status
[00:52:44] during the Q course. So we did a jump like the week before I started language school.
[00:52:49] And I broke my tailbone. I broke my coxsus. I came down, I landed on the runway.
[00:52:56] Bro, those shoots are not made for big dudes. No, man. I come down like an asteroid.
[00:53:01] I always did too. Especially with equipment. I mean, I forgot about it. It's just a freaking
[00:53:05] disaster. Even at 1,300 feet. It's like by the time I shoot opens, I check my stuff. I drop my
[00:53:11] equipment pretty much immediately and I'm smashing into the earth with a vapor trail behind me.
[00:53:16] You know, so I came down. I had some wind. I couldn't steer. Couldn't avoid it runway.
[00:53:22] This is happening. Boom. Broke my tailbone. I thought I paralyzed. I thought it was
[00:53:26] freaking horrible. It was scary. Guys have been paralyzed from that type of accident.
[00:53:30] Yeah. I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe. I'm like, okay, this is the rest of my life.
[00:53:35] Fortunately, it was just a broken tailbone, which is not a convenient injury.
[00:53:40] You know, never had it, but it doesn't sound like there's no great. You can't cast it,
[00:53:45] you know, so you just have to stay off of it and let it kind of heal the best they can.
[00:53:49] But I'm immediately going into language school where I'm going to be spending
[00:53:52] eight hours a day in a classroom. So my first, I don't know, three, four months of language school,
[00:53:58] I was either on a knee or standing because I couldn't sit. You know, eventually I was coming
[00:54:04] to class one of those donuts, you know, those inflatable things. So I was doing so. I mean,
[00:54:08] I also, not an academic, trying to learn a new language, which I'm convinced is in the same area
[00:54:16] of the artistic side of people's brains. Like if you can play music or if you can paint,
[00:54:22] that's the art form of learning a language. My wife's a great example. She's both like,
[00:54:26] she's a musician. She's a phenomenal artist. She can pick up foreign languages like that. For me,
[00:54:31] nah, dude, it was brutal. It was just forced reps. Like that's how you do it. So I mean,
[00:54:39] and you have to test out, you have to test out like a certain level. Yeah,
[00:54:42] you're gonna test out what you're gonna test out at. What I would say would be like a,
[00:54:47] like a between a beginner and a novice level to have a working knowledge, I think is the
[00:54:53] way they kind of describe it. Where is that language school for practice?
[00:54:58] Jack, what, what, what were you, you were a 18 Bravo? Were you a Bravo?
[00:55:03] I was a Bravo. And how was that part of the schooling?
[00:55:06] That was great. Now the Bravo course was awesome. You know, just learning weapons and
[00:55:11] a little bit into tactics, but you're just playing with guns all day.
[00:55:15] Did you pick that? Is that what you wanted?
[00:55:16] Yeah. So I picked my, I picked my MOS and my language, which determines your group.
[00:55:22] Everyone that gets selected, or at least back then, picked those two things,
[00:55:26] requested MOS and requested language. And they would give, I think it was the top,
[00:55:31] like 15% or 20% of the performers would get what they, what they asked for. And then the
[00:55:36] rest would get whatever they, you know, they needed to get. So I requested Bravo and I wanted
[00:55:41] Russian cause I wanted to stay at that third group.
[00:55:44] What made you want to be Bravo?
[00:55:47] They're the ass kickers on the team, you know, stereotypically, but also in reality,
[00:55:53] because you kind of, you kind of have to be, man. And here's why you're, yes, you train
[00:55:59] on weapons and maintenance and troubleshooting, but you're also the primary tactician on the
[00:56:04] team or the primary tech tactical advisor to the team sergeant is that, you know, that's your
[00:56:09] support function on a team. So you're putting together ranges, you're executing training.
[00:56:14] Well, every SF guy, every soft guy thinks that he is a perfect tactician and a perfect
[00:56:22] marksman. The other skill sets, medics, commo demo, those are much easier for those guys to
[00:56:31] teach their teammates because they don't have the pride associated with not knowing medicine.
[00:56:36] I don't have the pride associated with not knowing how to use this, this radio.
[00:56:41] You walk up to a guy and say, you don't know how to use your rifle.
[00:56:44] That they don't take that very well. So you have to have an aggressive, dominant
[00:56:48] personality to be able to break through that barrier that your teammates have to be able to
[00:56:55] do your job. Yeah, they're going to take that very personally. They don't like that. You know,
[00:57:01] I don't like that. Like you're, you can't shoot and you don't understand tactics. You tell that to
[00:57:07] a green beret or seal or a ranger that it's not going to go well. Yeah, they're going to have
[00:57:11] that stuff. They're going to have a little bit of an eco flare in those scenarios. And how was,
[00:57:16] how was Robin Sage? Robin Sage was good. I mean, aside from the infill, which is,
[00:57:21] it's just, I mean, horrible. We didn't jump. Thank God. My buddies, who's a good buddy of mine
[00:57:27] today, he was on one of the teams that had to jump in because you're, everyone on that, on that team
[00:57:32] is carrying about 120 pounds in their rock to, you know, sustain off of, to conduct
[00:57:38] unconventional warfare in a denied area. That's what Robin Sage is. The teams that have to jump in,
[00:57:43] man, not, not, not dude. If I jump in without equipment, I'm coming in hot. Yeah. You throw
[00:57:50] 120 pounds on me. So I'm going to put a mark in the earth, putting dent in the earth. Yeah.
[00:57:57] So fortunately, I didn't have to jump, but you know, the infill, the infill is tough,
[00:58:02] no matter whether you jump in or not, you're humping miles through North Carolina.
[00:58:06] But once you get past that, then you're actually operating with other MOS's,
[00:58:13] which is the first time that you get to see that because it's the last thing you do and they bring,
[00:58:19] so now you can see what medics do. You can see what the 18 childlies do. You can see what the
[00:58:24] commo guys can do. You see the, the alphas, you see the team leaders up until you go to MOS,
[00:58:30] everyone's just a candidate. Then you learn your job and then you come together to execute your job
[00:58:35] with the other team, with the other MOS's. So I remember just when we were on infill, I started
[00:58:40] cramping up and I needed to take a short halt because I needed to stretch because otherwise
[00:58:45] I was going to go down and one of my teammates yelled the word medic, which is the first time I
[00:58:51] had heard that, like in real life, you're going to hear the movies, but someone actually yelled
[00:58:55] medic and then a medic showed up and I was like, Oh, this is like a real thing. We actually have
[00:59:00] you guys. I hadn't seen it before. So it was cool to see those different jobs and how they
[00:59:05] employed themselves within a team dynamic. So it was actually a lot of fun once you got past,
[00:59:09] you know, getting to your, your site. How long is the freaking infill?
[00:59:14] It usually takes, you know, like two to three days to get in. Yeah. I mean, every, every route's
[00:59:20] different. It's usually, it's trains, planes, and automobiles and a lot of walking. So, you know,
[00:59:25] horse trailer from here to here, you get there, you walk, you know, 12 miles through the wood line,
[00:59:30] link up over here, jump on a boat, move down this river, you know, it's like a full on
[00:59:36] infill as if you're going into actual denied area. That's what they try to replicate.
[00:59:41] You get done with that. That's it, right? That's when you get your, your designation,
[00:59:45] your green beret. That's it. Yeah. Did your parents come down for that? Oh, yeah. Did your mom put
[00:59:50] any crystals in your green beret? She probably did. She blew some incense on me. Do you have like
[00:59:57] one green beret that you got that one time? Like, and that's the one that you get and the one that
[01:00:04] you keep? The actual headgear? Yeah. So I still have the same one is the one I graduated with.
[01:00:09] Right. So that's, is that pretty common? I think that that's most common unless a guy like loses
[01:00:15] it. We don't really wear it that often though. So there's, there's no real need to upgrade because
[01:00:20] you like destroyed it. It's, it's kind of funny, man. You spend all this time thinking about becoming
[01:00:26] one and you want to earn this little green hat more than anything. So the top of this mountain,
[01:00:30] it means everything to you. You want to put it all on the line and then you get it and then you
[01:00:35] never want to wear it because it's just a pain in the ass to put on your head. So we don't usually
[01:00:40] wear a uniform all that often anyway, but when we do, obviously it goes on. So I think that's
[01:00:46] part of the reason why most guys, the one that they had originally is the one that they keep
[01:00:49] throughout their career. Yeah. No uniform is always not fun. I remember I always thought to myself,
[01:00:56] man, I'm like a, I'm like a 30, 35, 38 year old dude. I go to work all day. I don't have to wear a
[01:01:02] shirt man. This is the, this is the life. Freaking good to go. Yeah. But your parents came down to
[01:01:08] graduation and all that. Absolutely. How they feel about that. Cause now what year is it? 2010.
[01:01:16] Okay. So Iraq is kind of chilled out by now. So you must just be eyeing Afghanistan at this point.
[01:01:24] Yeah. So at this point, I know I'm going to third group, which is at Bragg, which is the one I wanted
[01:01:28] to go to because third group owned Afghanistan for that, for the groups, for the SF groups. That's
[01:01:34] all third group did. The other groups would filter in and support, but third group owned Afghanistan.
[01:01:40] That's where I wanted to go. That's why I chose that language. That's where I ended up going. So
[01:01:45] from my parents perspective, of course, they were proud of the work and happy for me for being
[01:01:51] successful, but also petrified because they knew what was coming. And this was 2010. You joined
[01:01:57] in 2007. Damn. That's a long freaking pipeline. Yeah. Yeah. That's a long pipeline. Now it's much
[01:02:03] more streamlined. So the current Q course, they've cut that white space in between. So they give
[01:02:09] guides, maybe it's a week or two or so off and it's, it's a much faster turnover rate. Got it.
[01:02:15] Yeah. So you get, how was it checking into, to the battalion? It was, I mean, I showed up,
[01:02:22] never having been in like a real unit before, other than as a student. And you don't get a whole lot
[01:02:28] of guidance. It's like report the third group on this day. It's like over there somewhere. I'm like,
[01:02:33] okay. So you find it, right? And then I walk into like group headquarters building and there's like
[01:02:38] some E five work in the CQ desk. And I'm like, hi, I'm here to report to first battalion. He's like,
[01:02:44] okay, it's over there. I'm like, all right, Roger that. So like I meander over there. And the funny
[01:02:51] the funny story is I'm walking around the battalion, trying to get all these little boxes checked off,
[01:02:57] right? Check in with S one, which is your admin section, check in with S two, your intel section,
[01:03:01] like get yourself administratively within the unit. I've never heard of S four. I don't know where it
[01:03:08] is. Like what's okay, it's over here. I find it. What do I need from you guys? So I'm meandering
[01:03:14] around pretty lost. Clearly I was lost because a dude comes up to me and P T's and he's like,
[01:03:19] can you help find something? And I'm like, yeah, man, I'm looking for this like S six thing. He's
[01:03:23] like, yeah, it's over there. And as soon as I start talking, he's like, you from Boston? I'm like,
[01:03:27] yeah, he's like, I'm from Boston. I'm like, Oh, no kidding. So we start talking about the socks and
[01:03:32] the paths and where you're from, which neighborhood, whatever, we're just like, bullshit. And then
[01:03:35] he's like, come on, let me show you something. Following this guy. No idea who it is. He brings
[01:03:40] me into an office. He's got red socks, pictures on the walls, all this memorabilia. We're just,
[01:03:48] we're chopping it up. And I realize I'm in the battalion commander's office. I haven't dropped a
[01:03:54] single sir. Yeah, I have no idea I'm talking to him. And it's like dawning on me. And I'm like,
[01:04:01] all right, but I'm just going to keep going with this because like, he seems cool with it. Maybe
[01:04:04] this is just the way it is. I don't know. It's my first day in the unit. And then I just hear this
[01:04:10] bellowing voice from the office next to it. And this was Sajam Major Spratt command, Sajam
[01:04:18] Major Spratt, who had just left SWIC, which is where the Q course and selection is, and came back
[01:04:25] to third group. And he had some specific language about, you know, asking very politely who was
[01:04:32] talking to the battalion commander that way. And he walked in the office and he's an old school SF
[01:04:38] guy, man, old school, like big mustache, big chest, right? Walks in, yelling at me. I look
[01:04:48] over the battalion commander like, are you going to, are you going to step in here? And he's just
[01:04:51] laughing. I thought we were boys. I thought we were buddies, you know? He hangs me out to dry
[01:04:56] completely. So Spratt's like, you know, looking at my name, he's like, I heard of you. He's like,
[01:05:01] you know, he's like, you're one of those combatives guys, right? You're one of those like MMA fighter
[01:05:05] type dudes. And I was like, I don't know if I should say yes to this. I feel like you may want to
[01:05:10] challenge me out back. And I don't know how that will go. I'm like, yes. Yeah, that is me. And he's
[01:05:16] like, okay, well, basically, don't ever talk to the boss like that again, and like, get out of here
[01:05:21] and like, go find your company. What gave you that reputation as being an MMA guy? Because,
[01:05:25] what, just because you wrestled or were you, did you pick up Jiu-Jitsu and stuff along the way?
[01:05:29] So I ended up getting a MacP, which is the Army Combatives Program, cert one and two during basic
[01:05:36] training that they offered to just like guys that were proficient with combat sports. So I showed up
[01:05:42] to the unit that with that. And then, or during the Q-Course. And then actually, when I was in Robin
[01:05:51] Sage, Alan Shabaro, who's a Jiu-Jitsu Black Belt former third group SF guy, he was a cadre for a
[01:06:00] different field team out at Robin Sage. And he came over one night randomly and was like, hey,
[01:06:07] you know, I heard you're into like combatives and stuff like that, you know, come check out my gym
[01:06:11] once you get out of here and you graduate and whatnot. That was my intro into into Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:06:15] So I've been training with him a little bit before I actually showed up on day one. I just think
[01:06:21] maybe word kind of just travel kind of quick, you know, whatever. But so that's your welcome aboard.
[01:06:27] You freaking bro out with the battalion commander and then get your ass chewed.
[01:06:32] And how long does it take for you before you get into like an ODA?
[01:06:37] I was on my first team probably probably a week or two after that. Because the timing was interesting.
[01:06:43] My entire company was forward in Afghanistan, but they only had about a month left before they were
[01:06:48] coming back. Every team except for one of them was forward. And there was a team that was a
[01:06:55] that deployed offset from the rest of the company and the battalion because it was a specialized
[01:07:00] team. So it took my company, Saja Major, a little bit of time, a couple days to think about
[01:07:06] where to put me. Because I met him that day, my very first day I made my way over the company,
[01:07:11] met the Saja Major, introduced himself. He said, cool, man, like, what are your goals? I said,
[01:07:15] I want to get in Afghanistan like now. He's like, of course you do. But like the entire company's
[01:07:19] coming back. It doesn't make any sense. By the time you get there and get situated,
[01:07:22] you're going to just be packing things up and come home. So the timing's not there. But I do
[01:07:27] have this team that's set to go forward in a few months. I'm like, cool, can I go to that one?
[01:07:32] He's like, well, it's a different type of team. So like, let me think about it. He did. Eventually,
[01:07:38] I sat down with the team, Saja, into that team. And this team focused on preparation of the
[01:07:44] environment is the task that we were assigned. So kind of like left-to-bang type stuff, which
[01:07:50] isn't exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted to go kick down doors and shoot bad guys in the face.
[01:07:55] This team was not designed to do that. But it was more designed to find the bad guy so that
[01:08:01] someone can go kick him in the face. It's designed to facilitate the door kickers to get to the guy
[01:08:06] or get to the area. So I mean, it was that type of work. And it was a very senior team because
[01:08:12] most guys would go spend a few years on a standard ODA and then they would migrate over into this
[01:08:17] type of stuff. So senior dudes. But eventually, that's the route that I went when I was on that
[01:08:23] team within a couple weeks of getting a group. I mean, I'm just going to say, you're a new
[01:08:27] guy. You're checking in. You get a chance to go to Afghanistan in a more rapid manner. They could
[01:08:32] probably told you like, hey, we need to cook to go to Afghanistan. A month you'd have been like,
[01:08:36] I'm in. At least I know I would have been. I'm like, cool. Where's the freaking spatula?
[01:08:41] Where's the ladle? Yeah. Let's do this. Did you have any time to like prep? Was there any
[01:08:49] type of workup or are they already done with all that? No, there was a workup. I think maybe,
[01:08:53] yeah, like I said, I think I was on the team about four months before we infilled. So I went
[01:08:57] and I learned Dari, which is a prominent language of Afghanistan. So I spent six months in the Q
[01:09:03] course, getting my ass kicked, learning Russian, show it to my group. And they're like, welcome,
[01:09:08] go learn Dari. My God, kidding me. I can't get away from this language thing, man, which
[01:09:13] I understand the value of it now. Actually, even once I was able to employ it. So it was three months
[01:09:18] of that. And then some like preparatory collective training that we did. But it was pretty fast and
[01:09:25] furious before I was out the door. And then you, how was that deployment? What was it like when
[01:09:31] you got there? It was amazing. You know, initially, I wanted to come in, do my five year contract,
[01:09:40] get some payback for 9 11, learn some skills and then get out. This was not going to be
[01:09:45] like my profession or my career. And then I got to the ground, I got on the ground in Afghanistan.
[01:09:50] It was a nine month rotation, mostly down in Kandahar. We were mostly doing split team
[01:09:55] stuff. So one team was on the packy border and the other team was in like downtown Kandahar. So
[01:10:00] I was getting a chance to see more rural and urban environment. And because of the team I was on, I
[01:10:06] was seeing the more overt stuff where we get in like mounted gun trucks to go support a particular
[01:10:12] op to being in a soft skin Corolla driving through downtown Kandahar and just very close. So I was
[01:10:18] exposed to a lot of what ODAs can do, what SF guys can do aside from the thing I really wanted to do.
[01:10:26] You know, so we didn't get into a couple little things somewhat by accident, but
[01:10:32] it was in that deployment that I couldn't imagine doing anything else. I decided like this is what
[01:10:38] I'm going to do for my career. And I reenlisted actually in Afghanistan for like another six,
[01:10:43] I think it was beyond my current contract I was on. So it was great. So was the op tempo good
[01:10:50] where you were working all the time? Busy. Busy. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, like sitting around for
[01:10:56] a long period of time. You were getting after it all the time. No, no, it was it was super busy.
[01:11:00] And that's cool. You get out get exposed to a wide spectrum of different things that are happening.
[01:11:06] You get to see a lot. Yeah. That's a freaking great first deployment for you. Yeah. And I was
[01:11:10] again, I was with all these senior guys. So I was an E five and everyone else was E seven or eight
[01:11:16] or an officer. So I'm just learning from these dudes that have been around for a really long time.
[01:11:22] And you know, some of them were on their fifth, sixth Afghanistan pump. So I'm just I'm drinking
[01:11:27] from a fire hose, but just the knowledge that was coming in from these dudes, it just
[01:11:33] got caught the bug. And I was like, yeah, this is it. This is this is for me.
[01:11:36] You get done with that deployment. You said you've gotten us some things. I mean,
[01:11:43] you get you get in some gunfights. You guys got a few gunfights over there on that one.
[01:11:47] Yeah. Yeah. But not nothing that like was too major. No, no, it was nothing anything all that
[01:11:53] serious. But what's what's funny about it is because the mission that we were on is not designed
[01:11:59] for us to be in those environments. But you know, there would be like a Lurse unit or like
[01:12:04] a another unit over here that was going out to this area for whatever mission they had. And we're
[01:12:09] like, well, maybe there's something out there we can check out that isn't lying with that mission.
[01:12:13] I don't know. Maybe I can talk to someone over there. Maybe there's something.
[01:12:18] So we would just get added on to their car and then some things would happen. But because of
[01:12:24] our team and our reporting channels, it was different than the other units in the AO.
[01:12:29] So even though we had been in these engagements, there was no like reporting of it happening.
[01:12:35] At one point, the commander that we actually worked for heard about some stuff and he showed
[01:12:41] up to our site. We were working under NSW. So like, it was a CO05 that showed up. And he's like,
[01:12:49] has everything going about first time I met him? He's like, okay, so just so you know,
[01:12:53] I know what you guys are doing. And you need to stop. Trying to keep the boys trying to keep
[01:13:02] the boys down. Come on. So you come home from that deployment. What's next? A ton of schools and
[01:13:10] training individual schools. At that time, we were doing usually was six months on nine months off
[01:13:17] before we would re rotate. For me, I think it was ended up being around nine or 10. I was back in
[01:13:21] the States, but it was just individual school one after another. And then I went back over
[01:13:28] in Afghanistan for a short period of time with on a tasking from another unit that needed some
[01:13:35] support. And so I went over there for a quick little thing and came back and then
[01:13:41] like how long was that when you say a quick little thing? Was it like months or was it like
[01:13:44] four months? 90 days. 90 maybe 120 days somewhere between three and four months.
[01:13:49] All right. Now, are you still with the same ODA this whole time? Yeah. So you still are kind
[01:13:56] of focused on the same type of mission? Yes. Until I get back from Afghanistan. And then my company,
[01:14:03] Sajamajia, decides he wants to put me on a standard ODA or a direct action focused ODA. So this is
[01:14:09] after your second after that 90 day stint. Yeah. So on the 90 day stint, you're over there. Did you
[01:14:14] get some good lessons learned from that deployment? Oh yeah. What did you take back from that one?
[01:14:20] That there are other units within the SOCOM enterprise that operate at an entire different
[01:14:28] stratosphere, which I could tell even as a junior Green Beret working on, you know, around ODA,
[01:14:33] guys, there are other people out there that are really good at what they do and they know how to
[01:14:39] do it. So I was a, I was a riding on the side of this thing. They just needed some support. It was
[01:14:46] first PSD stuff. Okay. It came over to third group because we're on for brag and they needed like
[01:14:52] a bigger combatives, PSD type dude just to like take orders and not talk or ask questions. And I
[01:14:59] was the guy, I mean, I got this all day. I didn't know really like what I was doing. I understood
[01:15:06] like PSD work, but who I was with and what we were doing. It took me like a while to like figure
[01:15:13] that out. But I learned a ton and that was really what sunk my teeth into what my next thing would
[01:15:20] be post ODA time. Did you, are you still, are you training Jiu-Jitsu all the time now? Yeah.
[01:15:27] So when you got back and what about when you're on deployment, are you training at all? Do you
[01:15:30] have time? Oh yeah. Make time. Every trip I've been on, I've built a little fight house. Even
[01:15:37] into like austere stuff, we'll get into the next actual rotation. We're in the mountains
[01:15:41] doing VSL when I built us a fight house up there. So that's, so you come back from the 90 day
[01:15:47] stent where you're doing PSD type work and then you get put in, now this one you get and put it
[01:15:52] to like a DA type ODA. Yeah. Yeah. I get back and my, my, my deal was I would do two rotations on
[01:15:58] the first team I was on and I committed to that because there's a lot of time they spend in training
[01:16:04] you know how to do certain stuff. So it was like, yeah, there's no problem. Sajima Jiu came in
[01:16:09] right after I got back and he's like, Hey man, I'm going to talk to your team, Sajima, but I think
[01:16:13] you need to be on like a, like a DA team, you know, you're like, you don't fit in and this team
[01:16:18] you're on now, you don't blend. You're like, you're like, you're the worst low visibility guy in the
[01:16:24] history of freaking special forces. Yeah man. So it didn't make sense from that lens. And I was young
[01:16:30] and hungry and he wanted to like, you know, maximize on that, leverage that, get me into the fight
[01:16:35] for more traditional sense. So he made with my team side and seems like, cool man, this is what he
[01:16:39] wants. This is what's best for him. Roger that. So he let me go and then I went to a DA team.
[01:16:44] This is now in like early 2012 and I was with them just in time to go through a full train up
[01:16:53] nice of that type of work before we went in. What was my second actual combat rotation in the fall
[01:17:00] of 2012. And so how's that? How's that working out? It was, it was night and day man. My first pump
[01:17:09] doing what we were doing. We were living kush. We were living kush. Everyone had their own shoe.
[01:17:16] I had air conditioning and I had a full size bed. I had a plasma TV. Two different child halls,
[01:17:22] two different gyms, full blown fight house. Cause one of our camps was in the, was like on the
[01:17:28] back end of a mass of a bigger fob. So we had all the fob stuff, but then we had our own, our own
[01:17:34] stuff, you know, OGA camp was right next to us. They had a whole bunch of cool stuff. So I was,
[01:17:39] but that was not, that was just the way it was for me. It was my first trip. Like this is the way,
[01:17:43] this isn't living off the land. You kidding me? I haven't had to kill a single snake yet.
[01:17:47] You snake eaters. I got two child halls to choose from. When I switched teams and went to the DA team,
[01:17:55] we went in to do VSO, village stability operations. And that by design is very austere. You actually
[01:18:02] have limitations on what you can do to build up your physical infrastructure to keep it within
[01:18:07] line with what your partner force or those within that area with how they live. We assimilate to them,
[01:18:13] which is exactly the mission we wanted. But when you get dropped off on, you know,
[01:18:18] mountaintop helicopter to zero three, and you're the first team that's occupied this site,
[01:18:24] there's nothing. And it was like, Oh, this is what ODAs do. This is okay. This is what this,
[01:18:32] so it was a night and day shift from my first trip to my second. So now you're out in the middle of
[01:18:38] where are you Wardak? You're so you're in Wardak, just your ODA team in the middle of nowhere.
[01:18:44] So there were three teams that they inserted into Wardak along the Chalk Valley,
[01:18:48] two on one side, one on the other, but it was really just us to mutually support each other.
[01:18:55] And you are starting from scratch, building out what you're going to build out,
[01:19:00] because there's no preexisting team there at all. There's no turnover or nothing. There was a turnover
[01:19:04] only because the team that was on the ground when we got there, they had closed down their site,
[01:19:11] which is where we were originally planning on going. But as things changed operationally,
[01:19:15] they shut that site down. They packed up all their stuff. They moved to this secondary location.
[01:19:23] They were on the ground for 24 hours before we landed. So, so there's nothing. There's nothing.
[01:19:29] There was a team there, but they hadn't been working out of that site. Right. So then you
[01:19:33] guys start building out, do you have a partner force that's there? Yeah. So they handed over
[01:19:38] their partner force to us, which was an A&AsF team. So the regiment, the Army Special Forces had
[01:19:44] created an Afghan National Army Special Forces unit. They looked structurally the same way as us,
[01:19:51] same MOS, the same breakdown. And they had 12 guys or whatever. 12 guys, just like ours. Yep.
[01:19:56] So you show up there, you get settled in and is the AO, how hot is the AO? It was, it was, it was
[01:20:05] busy. It was hot. We got our footprint, you know, we're like patrol based activities for the first,
[01:20:12] it's like 48 until we got some semblance of some force pro going. And then on maybe day three or
[01:20:18] four, we, we went to drive down the street to Afghan local police checkpoint, which you could see
[01:20:24] from our camp. There's maybe 400 meters down the road. I think we had a four vehicle convoy.
[01:20:30] I was in the little trail vehicle working out of a hatch. And by the time a second vehicle
[01:20:35] got on the road, we were ambushed. So at this point, we've got like some ratty chain link fence
[01:20:41] and some half filled Hasco as like force pro, there's nothing, you know, other than guys that are
[01:20:47] up there with 240s. So ting, ting, ting, ting, and I'm like, what, I don't know what's happened.
[01:20:53] What kind of vehicles? We were in Matt V's man that IG 33, 31. So I'm a bomber, you know, they're
[01:20:59] legit. But even though I had been around a couple, you know, engagements prior, it was nothing like
[01:21:07] this. Like we were like ambushed. This wasn't some, you know, moron who got creative with an AK47 to
[01:21:13] wanted to get his G hot on for a second and then drop his gun and run away. This was like a no
[01:21:18] shit. We're going to fight right now. So we were not even all the way out of the gate. No,
[01:21:25] it's all right there. So we dropped us off into a hornets nest, you know, which we kind of knew,
[01:21:30] although we were prepping for location a, we ended up at location B, but they were relatively close
[01:21:35] where a lot of our intel and prep in terms of personalities and leadership and cells and
[01:21:40] who we would be targeting was still considered the same. I didn't realize it was going to be
[01:21:45] quite that level of, of be high. So zero white space, which became our primary mission was just
[01:21:54] to open that up. So every day or every other day, whenever we rolled, it was just like move to contact.
[01:21:59] Like that's the, that's the mission for today. That's what we're doing. Let's go find the ambush
[01:22:04] and like set it off. And you're going out with your team plus the Afghan SF team. So you got like
[01:22:10] 20, 25 guys. So we also had an infantry squad that was there as an uplift. It's about 2022.
[01:22:19] So I made about 15 dudes, all super young minus that the squad leader, most of them were just
[01:22:25] fresh out of basic young and hungry though. Hell yeah. I can work with that all day. You
[01:22:29] give me a blank canvas. I love me some blank canvas. So it was, it was, there were stuts
[01:22:34] like savages. Eventually we created some savages. Afghan national army SF team was,
[01:22:41] was I dedicated pattern of force. Eventually within, I say the first month or so, we started doing
[01:22:46] bigger ops and we bring in Afghan national army guys or another commando elements or
[01:22:53] Afghan national police guys. And this leads to, you know, me, me eventually getting shot up
[01:22:59] with an insider attack is because when you start getting all these different dudes from different
[01:23:04] units, there's no practical way to establish a baseline with these, with these guys. You know,
[01:23:11] if you're living with somebody, you get to know that way you can tell if something's off, like
[01:23:15] the Spidey sense can start to go off because it's different. When you're getting new bodies as
[01:23:21] frequent as eventually we were, it drastically opens up the risk for an insider threat. Yeah.
[01:23:30] You end up, you get wounded early, huh? In this deployment? Is this deployment you get wounded
[01:23:35] for the first time? Yeah. What happened there? Yeah. I mentioned, I ended up taking some shrapnel
[01:23:40] to the back of my shoulder. We were on the ground for just a few weeks. We, you know, we drove the
[01:23:46] contact. We actually had an actual mission other than like, let's go find a fight to get into.
[01:23:50] We did get ambushed on the way from what ended up being what we considered to be the Taliban
[01:23:57] strong point village within our immediate AO. It was the first time that we actually maneuvered
[01:24:02] into it. And my team sergeant would tell you himself, like he made a, he made an aggressive
[01:24:09] decision. That's going to piss some people off to go in there. Yeah. And we were way over our
[01:24:15] heads and we were outgunned and outmanned, you know, because he just took myself, one of my
[01:24:19] teammates and then a handful of our partner force guys and we maneuver dismounted into the,
[01:24:24] into the village, just like the six of us. We had to swap our fire machine gun coming from the
[01:24:29] trucks and some mortars, but like we were in a village. Now you're in like a more urban environment
[01:24:34] with three US, three partner force. We've been on the ground just a few weeks,
[01:24:39] you know, on error. And he would tell you the same thing. Like it was a mistake.
[01:24:42] Like me actually getting hurt may have, may have saved that because we fought our way to
[01:24:49] a two story structure where we were taking Tishka fire from up to the road. So the guys are
[01:24:54] engaged in that way. There's some other dudes on some rooftops and there's six of us maneuvering
[01:24:59] through an urban environment, an Afghanistan urban environment, different than like Iraq,
[01:25:04] but you're still dealing with buildings and multiple level structures and windows and doors and all
[01:25:09] the hallways and alleyways, all the things. Right. So I even noticed that one point. I'm like,
[01:25:16] we shouldn't be here right now. You know, we shouldn't be here right now. This is a mistake.
[01:25:20] I didn't voice that. I was like, Roger that, like, let's, let's keep going. And we made it to
[01:25:26] the structure that we were trying to breach to deal with the, with the dish. Cause I was coming
[01:25:30] out of the second story. And we had been receiving some, some indirect that were coming in and
[01:25:37] dudes were dropping grenades out of structures as well. So we're at the breach point to enter
[01:25:44] the courtyard into this structure that is still actively engaging and something just blows up
[01:25:50] behind me. And there's a grenade and it just ripped into the back of my shoulder and it was like
[01:25:55] getting hit with a sledgehammer. And you think about shrapnel penetrating your body. You may
[01:26:01] think it's like this like piercing stabbing sensation, like a piece of metal going into you,
[01:26:06] but it's more just impact. Someone just hit you with a bat and then I look back and there's just
[01:26:12] like a lemon size hole in the back of my shoulder. I'm like, Oh, okay. This just happened. So I
[01:26:21] immediately just like, no, I'm fine. Now adrenaline's pumping. It's a shock, but there's no real pain
[01:26:28] that sets in. I'm like, we're good. My team sergeant comes over and he's like, no, no, no. So he
[01:26:34] grabs my other teammate. He starts putting some, we get into like a little strong point. He gauzes
[01:26:40] it up. Is the dish still firing? Yes. That's good times. Yep. So that's still going off.
[01:26:46] The boys in the trucks are really the ones that are getting it. And our partner force had
[01:26:51] been sending a separate dismount just themselves to stop moving in towards the building as well.
[01:26:57] So they're treating me some gauze, calm, you know, a pressure dress and wrap it up. And my team
[01:27:05] sergeants like, we're, we're aborting this mission right now. We're getting back to the trucks. And
[01:27:11] I'm like, no, no, I'm fine. Like, let's go. We just fought our way all the way to this door that
[01:27:14] we're in front of now. Like, let's, let's get in there. He's like, no, no, no. This is, we're in
[01:27:20] overrides. So that was the, that was the trigger for him to be like, yep, let's detach and take a
[01:27:26] look at what I'm doing. So a lot of ways I think I'm grateful because I don't know what was on
[01:27:31] the other side of that door, but those guys were still getting it. And it could have been,
[01:27:35] it could have been a lot of different things. Yeah. You know, yeah. Sometimes the things just pile up
[01:27:42] where, you know, I used to joke, you know, you have the no go criteria, like, hey, this is no
[01:27:47] go criteria. We don't have aircraft or we don't have this, we don't have that. And I used to joke
[01:27:51] and say, Hey, we just have go go criteria because we're fucking going. Like that was like, you know,
[01:27:55] my attitude, but then this thing would happen. Something else would happen. Something else
[01:28:00] would happen. And it would be like, this is a sign. Like these one sign I can overlook two
[01:28:06] signs. Maybe I'll ignore, but now we got three, four things that are going on that don't seem right.
[01:28:10] It's like, Hey, we're getting out of here. This is a bad call. And it sounds like he came to that
[01:28:14] conclusion, which, you know, you got one wounded guy, you got it a bunkered freaking dishka
[01:28:20] elements maneuvering through the city. Yeah. Could go sideways real quick. I mean,
[01:28:28] how much different does that impact? Does that shrapnel have to hit you where all of a sudden
[01:28:32] you're not just a wounded guy, you're a dead guy, or you're a severely wounded guy. I mean,
[01:28:36] two inches freaking, it's ridiculous how those little things can change the whole, the whole
[01:28:42] scenario. How bad were you actually hurt once you guys pulled out? It wasn't, it wasn't bad.
[01:28:49] You know, I get back to the trucks and we, we ITB and my medic takes a look at it and
[01:28:55] he's like, do your good, but it's like a pretty good hole here, man. So this was the first time
[01:29:00] anyone had been wounded. We'd been in the ground maybe just like a few weeks, like I said. And so
[01:29:03] he gets me medivac'd out and I throw a temper tantrum at the camp. I'm like, I'm not going anywhere.
[01:29:11] And my team side is like, yes, you are. I'm like, so I think I'm going to Germany. I think I'm
[01:29:16] going home like we just got here. This is where I need to be. You know, I'm really childish
[01:29:23] in my response to that. But I do and I get back to, they sent me to one of the, one of the
[01:29:29] outstations where there actually was a, was a forward surgical team and they treated it.
[01:29:35] And the way they treat that is they pack it with this antiseptic gauze because they can't just
[01:29:40] sew it shut because it'll leave this open cavity. Now to get infected for infection. So they pack it
[01:29:45] and then you just change that dressing out, you know, three, four times a day. So it closes from
[01:29:50] the inside out. It was it. It really wasn't a big deal. I was supposed to stay at that location
[01:29:57] until it was completely healed. The head doc who was at Bagram was made aware of my wound.
[01:30:05] And he said, Nick will stay where you are until it's closed to make sure that there's no infection.
[01:30:10] How'd that work out? Yeah. After about three, four days, I started getting anxious.
[01:30:20] And the only rotary wing flights that were going into my site where my team was was coming out of
[01:30:26] Bagram. So either way, I had to get to Bagram before I could initiate movement back to
[01:30:30] jaw res, which is where we were. Well, I grabbed one of my buddies who's on that support team that
[01:30:35] was there. And I said, bring me down to the time back, which he does. And I go from one C 130 to
[01:30:41] another one until I find one that's going to Bagram. And I go up to the time, like, Hey,
[01:30:46] you guys go to Bagram. It was like the third plane I walked on. And they'll like, Yeah, we're taking
[01:30:50] off in like 10 minutes. And I can wait through. They're like, Sure. So I just jump in the plane.
[01:30:53] I don't tell anybody where I'm going, land at Bagram. I had been to Bagram before. That's where
[01:30:59] we originally landed when we got there. But I was only on Bagram for like a day until we just got
[01:31:04] all about stuff together. And then we flew out to our site. So I wasn't familiar with Bagram at all,
[01:31:09] which back then it was like a city. I mean, Bagram is huge. So I land, I have no idea really where
[01:31:14] I am. I know that the special ops camp is in the vicinity of this. So I find my way over there.
[01:31:21] And I walk into the jock. And it was my first time actually being in like a real jock. I hadn't
[01:31:27] seen one before with all the TVs and all the different staff sections. And they're all wired
[01:31:31] in. It was like, This is kind of cool. I haven't seen it before. And I walk in and the sodif commander,
[01:31:39] who's my battalion level command team, they're the ones that are running the sodif,
[01:31:43] special operations task force. He's like, Hey, what are you, what are you doing here? And I'm
[01:31:50] like, Hey, sir, hey, doing, you know, I need to ride back to, to JARES. This dude's from Boston.
[01:31:56] So he starts going off. He had actually brought in a bleach a seat chair that he bought that used
[01:32:04] to be in Fenway Park as his like battle chair. Hell yeah. So they refurbished Fenway Park and
[01:32:11] they sold a bunch of stuff. So he brings this over with him to Afghanistan. So rather than focus on
[01:32:15] why I am there, he just wants to show me his chair. He's like, Dude, look at the chair I brought
[01:32:19] it has this great. This was used to be out in Fenway Park, whatever. And I'm kind of like, Yeah,
[01:32:24] that's it. That's awesome. That's an awesome ship. Well, then the, then the sodif commander,
[01:32:28] Sergeant Major walks over and he's like, No, really, what are you doing here?
[01:32:33] I like how you can always know the officers, but the freaking E dogs, man, they're on to your
[01:32:38] bullshit. There was no any Jedi thing happening with him. He's like, Why are you here? And I'm,
[01:32:45] I'm like, coming up with some bullshit that doesn't float. And then the phone rings. And
[01:32:50] he picks it up and I hear the yelling on the other end of the phone. And it's my company,
[01:32:56] Sergeant Major, who is at the location that I had just left from. I've been gone maybe three hours
[01:33:01] or something for hours. And I hear him screaming and CSM is like, Oh no, he's right here in front of
[01:33:07] me. And I'm like, Okay, now I know this is about me. I don't am I going to get court-martialed?
[01:33:13] Like what happens? I don't know. I know I'm in trouble. So he hands me the phone and my company,
[01:33:19] Sergeant Major, just loses his mind on me, you know, for like 10 minutes. And I'm just like,
[01:33:24] Roger that, Roger that, a lot of that going on. And at the end, he's like, Okay, dude, listen,
[01:33:29] like, I get it. I get it. I've been there before I get it. But like, don't ever do that again.
[01:33:34] I said, Roger that hang up. Well, now everyone's kind of joking about it a little bit. CSM thinks
[01:33:41] it's kind of cool, but he's also trying to be professional. There's a lot of people around.
[01:33:44] I've clearly just done something and subordinate. It was it was a the commander eventually gets
[01:33:50] switched on. He's like, Oh, wait, what? Did you really just do that? Well, my team's on a mission,
[01:33:57] right at that point. My first time in a jock, I just got yelled at, which is fine. We're kind of
[01:34:02] joking. And I look up red lights that's going off, you know, essential personnel only inside the
[01:34:09] jock, people are leaving, people are coming in, people are getting spun up, I can tell something's
[01:34:12] going on. And it's my team on and off and my team sergeant takes around to the abdomen. And I'm
[01:34:18] watching this for the first time through the lens of an ISR feed, I've never seen it before.
[01:34:24] And it takes a minute to realize what's happening. And I put two and two together, and I have, you
[01:34:28] know, an emotional breakdown of rage. And I'm like throwing chairs, immature, completely emotionally
[01:34:36] charged response or reaction. And I'm like, you guys need to get me a ride now. I'm going back.
[01:34:45] And I get pulled out of the jock, and the dock shows up. And I'm with the group or the SOTIF
[01:34:54] commander, and the SOTIF CSM and the doc comes over. And he's like, Why are you here? You need to
[01:35:02] wait till you're healed. You're not going back. And I started yelling at him. And then the command is
[01:35:08] like, Listen, doc, I don't think you want to tell this dude, like, no, like he's, he just like,
[01:35:15] jumped on a plane and flew here. Like he's like, he's gonna he's going back. So they
[01:35:19] overrode that decision. And I was back on a bird the next day or the day after that, back out with
[01:35:25] the team. And what happened to your wound, the guy that got wounded? Would you say that was your
[01:35:29] team surgeon? Yep. So he came in, I was there to meet him at the hospital when he showed up to
[01:35:33] Bagram, which was good. He went into surgery. He was medivac out of country. He was over in Germany.
[01:35:39] I don't think he ended up going back to the States, because he returned back in to the team. He was
[01:35:46] out of the game for maybe a month or two. And then he came back over. Do you guys have any kind of
[01:35:53] backfill plan? I mean, you only got 12 dudes. When someone gets hit, that's like a freaking significant
[01:35:59] amount of the force. Yeah, every dude does play a big role. We didn't get outfitted with the with
[01:36:08] the new team sergeant, just the next senior guy on the team picked it up. Yep. Oftentimes, we will
[01:36:16] get augmented by by one of the support teams that's in the area. Yeah, because I mean, you got 12
[01:36:21] guys, like that's that's a freaking important gun, just like legit, like just a gunner. Even vehicles,
[01:36:29] like whatever you're doing, that's freaking crazy to think about that. You lose two or three guys,
[01:36:34] like you're almost you need replacements sometimes. Oh, yeah. So you get back up there now. How often
[01:36:41] do you what's your op tempo like? Like how often are you guys going out? Yeah, we're going out
[01:36:45] probably three, four times a week. And and most of the time, do you have things that you're doing
[01:36:52] trying to do civil affairs out there? Or are you going out patrol to contact? Like what are you
[01:36:55] guys actually trying to do? Yeah, so our mission was to open up white space, open up freedom of
[01:37:03] maneuver so that some of the other units in the entire AO had the ability to begin their X fill
[01:37:11] process. So this is 2012 going into 2013. The writings on the wall that we're about to close
[01:37:18] down Afghanistan. So the units on the ground are making those preparations to be able to get men
[01:37:24] with weapons and equipment to Bagram and to Canada. So we needed to open up some lanes. So does
[01:37:30] that mean you're are you setting up combat outposts out there? Or are you just going out clearing and
[01:37:35] then leaving? What are you doing? No, so the Afghan local police concept was built specifically for
[01:37:41] this where we would build and or reinforce checkpoints along the major avenues throughout the AO.
[01:37:51] So there were these Afghan local police checkpoints that were all down the major roads. So we were
[01:37:57] rather building those out, validating the ones that were already there, training the guys that were
[01:38:02] there or bringing in like resources and stuff to make them more effective. So let's say you might,
[01:38:08] oh, we got this checkpoint down there, checkpoint four, we're going to go out there today, we're
[01:38:12] going to check their force structure, we're going to meet with their people, we're going to give
[01:38:15] us some pistol training, and then we're going to come back. That's kind of like the type of stuff
[01:38:19] that you were doing. Yeah, that and then we were tied also into the local and regional government
[01:38:25] officials to help them with their structure and they're building out and just gaining more control
[01:38:31] of the area from like a civil and diplomatic perspective, which it's a tough task to do that
[01:38:37] in Afghanistan. So we mostly focused on Afghan local police enhancement via checkpoints along
[01:38:45] the major routes. What's the local populace populace think of you?
[01:38:51] Hit or miss. In an area like that, you're really putting the local populace in a lose lose scenario.
[01:38:57] We come in big, big white guys, big American guys,
[01:39:02] tatted up with all the guns and this stuff. And we come in and be like, you're going to help us.
[01:39:07] And what are they going to say? No. The problem is when they say yes, the actual dudes that run
[01:39:12] the show in that whole area, they're going to come back. So, you know, it's tough. And they know
[01:39:18] those Americans, they know that they're going to leave someday. The local populace like, oh,
[01:39:22] you're here now, but the Taliban is going to be here forever. Yeah. So it's an impossible.
[01:39:29] Is the biggest threat on the ground IEDs at this point?
[01:39:34] At this point, the biggest threat on the ground was IEDs and then a close second would be the
[01:39:40] insider attack, which once that happened to us in what it would have been early 2013 on the same
[01:39:48] deployment. That was kind of the catalyst that drove that threat up to supersede IEDs within
[01:39:54] that immediate area because it was just so effective. You ended up getting shot again, right?
[01:40:00] Or you get shot? Yeah. In the what? In the face? In the face. Yep. I took an AK round,
[01:40:06] which sounds worse than it was. It really just grazed my cheek and, you know,
[01:40:10] ripped a chunk open. It did clip an ottery, so it bled a bit, but I didn't know that I had been
[01:40:17] shot for like an hour or two after the fact because it was the result of a massive IED that
[01:40:25] hit ILEAD vehicle, decimated the truck. And when I showed up to that vehicle, there were some
[01:40:32] dismounts that had showed up as well. This was a full on ambush. So we'll talk us through it. So
[01:40:37] you're out on patrol. How many vehicles got with you? So we had, I think it was four trucks and
[01:40:42] a couple side by side raises on that. We were returning to base from the thing. We just did
[01:40:48] like a KLE, a key leader engagement. How far away are you from like, what are these? Are these like
[01:40:53] four mile, five mile transits? Are they shorter than that? This one was a little longer. This one
[01:40:57] we drove out along the main road, maybe nine miles, 10 miles. And we were on the way back
[01:41:04] when we hit this. And we had driven down this road multiple times before. And this thing had been
[01:41:13] in place before all that. They just, they never set it off. LEAD vehicle, which has my team leader
[01:41:20] in it, he, that vehicle gets just decimated. What vehicle are you in? I'm in vehicle four,
[01:41:25] working out of a hatch. And I see it go off in front of me. And we had hit a bunch of smaller
[01:41:31] IEDs before. So I was familiar with it. But this thing was the biggest and the most accurately
[01:41:38] timed. It just, it was perfect. Picks up the truck and just launches it off the side of the road
[01:41:44] down into this apple apple orchard off to the side. And it was down this little ravine
[01:41:50] off the side of the road. And that was the initiation of a complex ambush. So PKM,
[01:41:54] IPG, some indirect are all coming in. And, you know, I know what react to ideas. We have that
[01:42:04] SOP established. And I don't do my job. This is important note. Instead, I jump out of this hatch,
[01:42:12] the vehicle's still moving. And I take off on foot towards the truck, which was, you know,
[01:42:18] a couple hundred meters away from me, not a tactical movement by me, like rifle in hand.
[01:42:25] And I'm just at a dead sprint to the vehicle. And I slide down off the side of the road into
[01:42:30] this, into this orchard. And I know, solo, this is a solo. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just going by myself.
[01:42:38] I know everyone's dead. There's no way anyone survived that level of destruction. The truck is
[01:42:43] on its side. So drive the side door is pinned against the ground. Passengers side door would be
[01:42:49] facing the sky. And I, I slid off the road and I tripped and fall. And what I had tripped over
[01:42:55] was my teammate who was in the turret of that truck, who was ejected and landed about 30 meters
[01:43:03] from the vehicle. I didn't see him. I tripped over him, looked back and it's him. And he's alive.
[01:43:08] And I can't believe it. His leg snapped in half just below his knee. He's got a whole bunch of other
[01:43:14] like lacerations on his face, but he's alive. He's suffering from immediate blast injury for
[01:43:21] sure. He's incoherent, but he's alive. He's breathing. He's not bleeding from anywhere profusely. So
[01:43:26] I do like a quick assessment of him. And then I start hearing different rounds impacting the
[01:43:32] truck, which is behind me about 30 meters and some dismounts that showed up. And they were just kind
[01:43:38] of randomly shooting at the vehicle. They're shooting at the blown up vehicle? Yeah. So just
[01:43:43] ting, ting, ting. I turn around. There's three of them. So I smoked two. The third one takes off,
[01:43:51] run it. And this isn't again an apple orchard, but it's in October or it's November. So there's not
[01:43:56] a lot of vegetation. There's just mostly trees and branches. So you can, I can see kind of, but
[01:44:00] there's just a lot of, so I'm maneuvering through this. He's running away from me on an angle with
[01:44:07] his AK over his shoulder firing been my general direction while running away. And next thing you
[01:44:15] know, I'm looking up at the sky. Boom. I felt an impact. I'm looking up at the sky. And I thought that
[01:44:20] I had run into a branch from a tree and it just knocked me over. So I pop up and I like kind of
[01:44:29] look around and I'm fine. And I go to reengage on this dude and I noticed the vehicle is on fire.
[01:44:37] And I hadn't checked the vehicle. I had the only, I've only seen one of my buddies.
[01:44:41] So as bad as I really want to go kill this dude, I was like, I'm going to go check the vehicle
[01:44:45] instead. So fortunately, the passenger door, which against facing the sky had been blown off the
[01:44:51] hinges because the truck had basically collapsed on itself. So the turret was, you couldn't,
[01:44:56] there was no access point inside the cab other than that door. Climb up the vehicle,
[01:45:05] look in and my team leader is buried kind of where the driver seat would be. And he's trying to
[01:45:12] establish comms, which just says a lot about like training and like just doing what you'd need to do
[01:45:20] regardless of how bad it gets. I mean, he's in a exploded vehicle and he's a mess. Both his legs
[01:45:27] are are nasty. He's a below the knee amputee. Now both his legs are completely mangled.
[01:45:31] He's got an arterial bleed through his arm. His face is completely riddled with spall.
[01:45:37] And he's on the radio in a destroy decimated truck trying to establish comms, communicate to
[01:45:42] high Elb, what's going on? Says a lot about that dude. I'm looking inside this vehicle,
[01:45:47] you know, we're still taking PKM and RPG. Now our trucks are set up, they're returning fire.
[01:45:53] We got a couple of us 60 millimeter mortars out, they're returning fire.
[01:45:56] Team Sergeant, who are acting team Sergeant at the time, he's got a maneuver element that's
[01:46:02] maneuvering on the ambush line. I don't think anyone really knew what where I even was.
[01:46:07] Because I'm in the middle of all this that's happening. I look inside the truck, I see him.
[01:46:13] Okay, trucks on fire, it's burning from the back towards the cab. I look inside the rounds from
[01:46:20] inside the vehicle are starting to pop off from the heat. So it's like looking into a
[01:46:25] like a popcorn bag, pop pop pop pop pop pop. Rounds are still taking off the front of the truck
[01:46:30] from the enemy machine gun fire. I'm like, this is a really bad day here. And that this is where it
[01:46:36] ends. There's no way either one of us are making out of this. My team leader played offensive
[01:46:43] line at West Point. Big Cat. This is the dude that's legs are mangled, trying to make comms on
[01:46:50] the radio. Yeah, our captain. So he's a big Jack dude. Big boy. I wouldn't say jacked, but just a
[01:46:57] horse, six, seven, about, about two 90 to 25 without without kit. Big boy with kit, he's well over
[01:47:05] 300 pounds. And we used to joke about this, you know, which is kind of ironic that he and I can
[01:47:11] never be in the same vehicle because we were the only ones big enough to move the other guy
[01:47:18] if we needed to, which is what played out. So I see him in there, big dude wedged in a pile of
[01:47:25] metal that's on fire rounds outside the vehicle rounds inside the vehicle. Anyone else inside
[01:47:29] the vehicle? No. How is that? So it seemed like two got ejected or three got ejected. There were
[01:47:40] two in the back, the guy in the turret, and then the driver managed to scathing scamper out of that
[01:47:48] of that doorway before I got there. Were they Afghans or Americans? Was it all Americans?
[01:47:55] All Americans except for one of my turps, one of my interpreters was in that truck.
[01:48:00] God, I can't believe these guys made it out of there. Yeah, it's freaking crazy. It is. It is crazy.
[01:48:05] Because they all lived, but I assumed that everyone would be dead based on the level of damage.
[01:48:12] So I jump in the truck and I kind of just wedge him up a little bit out of the area where he was,
[01:48:20] kind of pressed him into the dash. And then I climbed myself back out and then just grabbed his
[01:48:26] kit and just like dead lifted him out of this thing and just chucked him over the side of the
[01:48:31] truck. And at this point, some of our partner force guys had showed up, a couple of my teammates
[01:48:35] had showed up. So they took him, busted out of Lita, began moving him. The truck pretty much burnt
[01:48:42] up completely within a minute or so after we were both out. And then we just circled around to find,
[01:48:50] scoop up all the rest of the guys that were just in random areas around, set up a CCP and then
[01:48:56] finished the fight and then went to our med course action.
[01:49:00] How far back was it to get back to base? We were maybe three, four miles out.
[01:49:07] So did you go back before you cast the guys? No, we set up an HLZ right there. Bird came in,
[01:49:14] we pushed out the dudes, they did launch a ground QRF element from one of the sister teams that was
[01:49:19] in the valley with us. They showed up on the ground. We met a back to five or six guys that were in
[01:49:24] that truck right from there. And then eventually I got medivac'd out after.
[01:49:33] Did you guys blow that freaking truck in place or did it burn so much that you didn't even have to do anything?
[01:49:38] I tried, they strapped a couple charges to it. But it was pretty much destroyed. Anyway,
[01:49:44] they recovered some of the combo stuff and then bit like the rest. But I was treating one of the
[01:49:51] guys in the vehicle once we established the CCP, his one of our attachments, one of our
[01:49:56] nerdy attachments, although important, his eye had come out of his head. So his eye was like
[01:50:02] dangling down where his cheek is. So I was treating him, put the eye back in the socket and I'm wrapping
[01:50:07] it up with gauze. And one of my teammates comes over and just slaps some gauze against the side
[01:50:13] of my face. And this is like 90 minutes after initial contact. And I'm looking up at him like,
[01:50:18] and I'm looking up at him like, what are you doing? And he's like, bro, you're like gushing blood.
[01:50:23] I'm like, really? I'm like, all right, so he's holding the thing against my face. I'm putting
[01:50:28] this guy's eye back in his head. And then I, you know, stand up, I take a look at it. I didn't take
[01:50:34] a look at it. I'm like talking to him. I'm talking to him. And my medic was like, yeah, I think we're
[01:50:40] going to need to get you out of here to get that looked at. And, you know, I throw another childish
[01:50:46] type of tantrum right there. I refused to leave until the other guys were out and then the QRF
[01:50:52] showed up. So they showed up situation under control. They were going to escort them back to base.
[01:50:58] There was one bird that had come back in. So I jumped on that. And then I was made it back to out.
[01:51:05] And then how was it? Was the result of that? I mean, would they do stitch it up?
[01:51:09] No, they had to cauterize it. I guess because it clipped an artery. So they sent me to Bagram,
[01:51:15] which is where the rest of the guys were at. And I wanted to just be with those dudes. I wasn't
[01:51:22] sure if some of them were going to live. I mean, some of them were like real banged up. So I wanted
[01:51:26] to get there and be with them. And I had a little bit of a situation with some of the army staff
[01:51:30] that were at the hospital. They have this protocol where they don't allow a kit, grenades, weapons,
[01:51:35] like they secure all that stuff into like a separate area. I had never been in a hospital
[01:51:39] like this before. And I just come blasting in the front door, angry, looking for my teammates. And,
[01:51:46] you know, two or three of these little like E3 med kids were like, stop physically like getting
[01:51:53] in my way to try to take my weapons and kit from me. And I did not appreciate that at all.
[01:52:00] Fortunately, one of them, another SF guy that was there came over and grabbed me and pulled me
[01:52:06] in real tight and was like, you need to calm down, man. So I gave him my stuff. And there happened
[01:52:14] to be a army reservist doctor was in Bagram, who in his day to day job owns a plastic surgery clinic.
[01:52:24] So he's an army doctor. And then he's a plastic surgeon civilian life. He was the guy that treated
[01:52:29] me. So he pulls me over and he's like, Hey, man, I gotta, I'm going to cauterize your wound. And
[01:52:34] then I'm going to, I'm going to sew it back up. I'm going to get you on some pain management stuff
[01:52:40] like now, like, interveneously. And I'm like, no, you're not doing that. And he's like, no,
[01:52:47] it's like gonna, it's gonna be unpleasant. I'm like, do listen doc, like hit me with some
[01:52:52] lidocaine if you want, that's fine. Some like numb it up. But you're not going to put me out of my
[01:52:57] mind. I'm not going to be stoned and drifting around this place in pixie land. Two of my teammates
[01:53:04] are in surgery. Three other ones are bedside right there. You need to hurry up and do whatever this
[01:53:09] is so I can go do my job, which is to be next to those guys right now. So the sort of commander
[01:53:16] had showed up because there's six or now I think seven of us wounded, he shows up and
[01:53:20] the doctor looks over at him and sort of commanders like just, just go ahead and do it. So I'm laying
[01:53:28] down on my side and he, this little medical welder that goes in and, you know, like burns it back
[01:53:33] together and then so is it shut and, you know, it's stuck. But I was so angry and filled with
[01:53:39] just rage and concern that it really wasn't that big of a deal. And then you said all the guys that
[01:53:45] got wounded, they lived. Yeah. Yeah. And yet how many of them got Kazovac out of country?
[01:53:53] All of them. So now how many guys you got left on your freaking team?
[01:53:57] So out of the out of the six, only two were SF guys. Okay. Our captain and our,
[01:54:05] another one of our weapons guys, another one of another Bravo, the guy was an a turret.
[01:54:09] So they replaced my captain. They gave us a new captain who was already in country. He was working
[01:54:18] out as like a staff support officer in one of the other locations. They pushed him to us.
[01:54:24] And then it's back to business. Yeah. You get back up and it's like,
[01:54:31] uh, you got to adjust to this new captain. You got to work through the guys that you did lose,
[01:54:39] the other guys that that left, even though they weren't, they weren't attached to your ODA, but
[01:54:44] you got to replace them somehow. So you can start figuring the stuff out how, how long it
[01:54:47] would take for you guys were going back out on ops. Yeah, there was definitely a lag.
[01:54:52] That was the end of November. So right around early December was when the snow came in anyway.
[01:54:59] And when you're at 75, 7,800 feet in the mountains, I mean, that's like real snow,
[01:55:05] like feet of snow. So the timing was kind of good for us because no one can move when you've got
[01:55:13] nine feet of snow outside in the mountains. So everything just kind of goes on pause for a little
[01:55:17] bit from like December through like the end of January. That's where we got a new captain.
[01:55:22] We got plused up with a couple more attachments to backfill the dudes that we had lost.
[01:55:27] So we had, you know, eight, nine weeks together just to kind of get our stuff together, bring the
[01:55:32] new captain of the speed. So by the time we were ready to kind of get back into it, come early
[01:55:37] February timeframe, he was, he was good to go. And then you start doing ops again. Yeah.
[01:55:45] And now you're working like you were talking about earlier, you're starting to do some bigger ops,
[01:55:50] and you've got a bunch of other Afghans coming in from different areas, different units,
[01:55:56] and that could be sketchy. And you guys know it's sketchy.
[01:56:01] Yeah. We, we prefer to keep our, our, our task org with our internal unit, because we lived with
[01:56:12] this A&AsF team. And we're talking about like a broken down clay, you know, structures. Like
[01:56:19] when I say we were living together, I mean, we were living together. Right. So you, you, you gain
[01:56:24] that bond with those, with those guys, and you learn them, you learn their personalities, their
[01:56:28] character, their, their quirks. When you start throwing, you know, hundred random dudes at us,
[01:56:34] because we're going to go do some massive village clients. You don't know any of these guys. We
[01:56:39] have been training them like randomly within our training cycle, where we would run through,
[01:56:45] you know, a couple of days with the Afghan national army, a couple of days with the Afghan
[01:56:49] national police, couple of days with the ALP, the local police guys, our own guys. So there was a
[01:56:54] there was a system in place, but they're still just sending us whoever they wanted to go to train
[01:56:59] in that day. And you know, you said, you mentioned earlier that the threat, IED threat started to
[01:57:05] be surpassed by the threat of an insider attack. So was there insider attacks before you guys had
[01:57:14] yours? Yeah. And so you guys are full, full aware like this shit can happen. Yeah, we were,
[01:57:19] we didn't take it as seriously as we should have. We didn't prioritize it enough to instill greater
[01:57:31] mitigation criteria. We had some stuff in place, but we got, we were sloppy, I think as a detachment.
[01:57:38] It's not anything you can prevent by any means, but we could have done a better job to mitigate it,
[01:57:45] you know, and a lot of the lessons that have gone out from the event with us,
[01:57:48] which is still considered the most catastrophic insider attack since 9 11 is the lessons learned
[01:57:55] from that are being employed now really much as like, as like pretty much a baseline for all the
[01:58:00] guys that work with with indige. All right. So, so let's get there. It's March 11th, 2013. And you
[01:58:08] guys are getting ready for some kind of a big operation. What are you doing to clearance? We,
[01:58:13] what were you planning to do? Yeah, we were doing a larger village clearance. I believe
[01:58:23] my memory is terrible during this whole timeframe because of me getting banged up that day. But I
[01:58:29] believe we were going to do like a 48 hour clearance with Iran and we were sit tight. I think it was
[01:58:39] more of an ALP checkpoint establishment mission to begin building something from nothing.
[01:58:46] And so this is one of those ops where you have a bunch of other Afghans that you don't know. Maybe
[01:58:51] you've seen them sporadically, but I mean, look, you get freaking a group of a hundred Afghans
[01:58:57] that you saw three months ago, you know, like who knows who these guys are. They might as well
[01:59:03] just been right. Random. So you guys had some, some standard operating procedures as far as
[01:59:12] what you would, how you conduct these operations because you knew it, you know, it is a threat.
[01:59:15] You know that an insider attack is there's some level of threat to it. So you have some standard
[01:59:21] operating procedures about how you're treating the Afghans. Correct. And keeping them some keeping
[01:59:28] some kind of distance. And so what is basically like you would only allow the leadership into the
[01:59:33] compound. That was kind of the standard operating procedure. Yeah. So our compound had two layers
[01:59:37] to it internal, which is where we lived and where our ops center was. And then we had outside that
[01:59:43] perimeter was where our motor pool was. So we kept our vehicles, fuel weapons, or not weapons, but
[01:59:48] other storage. So our SOP was for an op, the units would show up, they would stay outside of our
[01:59:59] entire perimeter. The leadership would come into our motor pool area. So we could brief them on
[02:00:06] what we were doing. Standard practice is you want to keep that window where you notify your
[02:00:12] partner force where you're going as narrow as you can, because they talk. So in an attempt to reduce
[02:00:18] that word getting out, we would just tell them right there and then and then we would roll.
[02:00:25] And that worked for us, you know, and the Bravo section 18 Bravo section is responsible for base
[02:00:32] defense. Right. So meet my team and I or my my section and I we the ones that put this together
[02:00:38] team size and obviously is the one that says yes, because we roll with and it worked that entire
[02:00:45] time. On this particular day, leadership comes in and a Ford range of pickup truck rolls in.
[02:00:56] And I immediately see it, obviously, it sticks out to me because it's a violation of the SOP
[02:01:00] that we developed and we've been executing two, three times a week for five and a half months.
[02:01:05] Is it like a technical does it have a mounted machine gun in it? I wouldn't call it a technical,
[02:01:10] but there was a mounted PKM in the back. I think a technical, I mean, I was in Eastern Africa,
[02:01:15] there's like different kinds of like Mad Max technicals. Yeah. So it's not an upgraded technical,
[02:01:20] it's like the lowest form of a technical possible. Yeah. You know, but a but a mounted PKM in the
[02:01:26] back, 100% mounted PKM in the back that a machine gun to operate from a standing position.
[02:01:32] That rolls in with two dudes and I see it and my first response wasn't oh,
[02:01:38] shit, this is a threat. It was, you know, these idiots just can't follow instruction,
[02:01:44] which is pretty common in Afghanistan. So my first response was just, I'm annoyed
[02:01:50] that you're doing this. And now I'm at a crossroads, man. And it's either,
[02:01:56] do I address this problem right now, an error on the side of security? Or do I let it ride?
[02:02:02] I go the more diplomatic route where my team sergeant talks to his leadership or my commander
[02:02:09] talks to his leadership and we handle it after the fact. I went with the more diplomatic option.
[02:02:16] This is it. And you've been working, I mean, you've had this SOP, it's worked,
[02:02:21] you've been working with a bunch of Afghans like, oh, these idiots,
[02:02:24] it's all just kind of leaning you in that direction of like, these people are stupid.
[02:02:29] And, you know, I'll square this away when we're done with the brief. Yeah, you know,
[02:02:33] and it's easy to look back and judge, which I do to myself about how easy you can get complacent,
[02:02:40] which is true. But when you've seen so many things that could have gone wrong, that didn't,
[02:02:47] you become conditioned to these types of mistakes or these types of acts by your
[02:02:52] partner force. It's not, they don't jump out as these glaring red flashing holy shit lights.
[02:03:00] But I noticed it and I'm like, you know what, I'll deal with this later. Let's just get through
[02:03:03] this mission and we'll address it after the fact. And this is the perfect storm because
[02:03:11] we do the mission brief, get our partner force leadership up to speed on what we're doing.
[02:03:16] And then we're doing our own team internal comms checks. So we're in a circle.
[02:03:19] And, you know, you go around, you go around the circle, right? Like Alpha up Bravo one up Bravo
[02:03:26] two up everyone's just checking comms. The trucks are all pretty much right behind me.
[02:03:32] They're all up and running. Coms are good in the truck. Weapons are good in the truck. First
[02:03:35] thing we do. Well, when I got our vehicle set up, I had left my go bag, my rifle, and then my
[02:03:45] crew surf all inside the vehicle. Important lesson to note. I have my Glock on me and I'm overdoing
[02:03:57] mission brief and final comps checks. Okay. My radio is good to go. And I immediately
[02:04:03] turned stop walking towards my truck, right? Kind of insubordinate because you're really
[02:04:07] supposed to stay there until everyone's good to go. Well, I'm like, I'm good. I can hear you.
[02:04:10] You can hear me. I'm going to go get my vehicle. And I'm walking away from the group. And that's
[02:04:16] when I hear the rounds crack off from behind me. And my first thought again was one of our Afghan
[02:04:23] partners had just indeed their weapon, just negligently discharged their weapon, which also
[02:04:27] wouldn't be unheard of. But after the second round, third round, fourth round, you know,
[02:04:32] I can tell it's coming from a belt fed machine gun, like no, no, someone's deliberately shooting
[02:04:36] at something. And I snap my head around. And one of those guys sure enough, I jumped up on the back
[02:04:42] of that four range and was just opening up into the crowd. Perfect setup for that. We're all lumped
[02:04:49] together. And he's, you know, 20 feet away with a PKM ripping into the crew. So I see that. And
[02:05:00] my first thought is move to cover, eliminate the threat, like just react to near ambush. And
[02:05:06] although I've played this game now, I don't know, infinite amount of times in my mind, I wonder if
[02:05:12] I had had my primary weapon system on me, would I have done what I am supposed to do? Because I had
[02:05:17] cover right there. There were four or five armored trucks right next to me. Take a couple steps
[02:05:23] over, weapon system comes up, problem goes away. And we move on with life. What I see,
[02:05:32] after I see the shooter is one of our infantry uplift. Soldiers who was scheduled to be a driver
[02:05:39] for us that day, frozen. And he's maybe eight feet in front of me. And he's like a deer in
[02:05:45] headlights. And he's staring at a guy with a machine gun shooting in his direction, 15,
[02:05:51] 20 feet in front of him. I see that. And although I know what I'm supposed to do,
[02:06:02] my love of a teammate superseded me doing my actual job. So instead of moving to some cover
[02:06:10] and eliminating the threat, I move towards this kid. And I take maybe just like three, four aggressive
[02:06:17] steps. I'm coming in pretty hot. And I get my back to the gunner and I get in front of this kid.
[02:06:25] And that's when I'm hit for the first time, just below my right ass cheek, upper thigh, boom,
[02:06:32] knocks me down on top of the soldier. And then I feel another two, three impacts to my legs.
[02:06:40] So I know I'm hit. I don't know the, I don't know the severity of it, but I've been hit before.
[02:06:47] I'm hit again. Okay, we'll deal with this here in a second. And I drag myself and this kid,
[02:06:54] you know, maybe four or five feet behind the front corner of another truck to get us a little bit
[02:07:00] of cover. People are dropping all around us. People are scrambling. I get to this, this next location.
[02:07:08] I don't have my rifle on me. There was a rifle laying on the ground next to me that I've seen
[02:07:14] your medic. It was his weapon. He had been hit. I roll over, I grab that, I throw that into action.
[02:07:20] I'm laying on my back. I put a couple horribly placed rounds towards this threat who's still
[02:07:27] engaging. And then one of my teammates comes in and smokes this dude. This was the initiation of a
[02:07:34] complex ambush. So we start taking machine gun fire and rockets from outside of the outside of the camp.
[02:07:39] So immediate threats been removed. I can tell that we're in a firefight, but I'm in no position to
[02:07:47] address any of those problems. So I go to my next course action and I check this soldier who I'm
[02:07:51] still kind of laying on top of who's just in shock, but there's no holes in them and he can breathe.
[02:07:59] So no massive, no massive hemorrhaging. He got an airway. Okay, we're good.
[02:08:03] I now look to see how bad my damage is. So I ripped my pant leg open and my right leg is just mangled.
[02:08:15] Doc's estimated it was probably four or five rounds I took to that leg. I took one to my
[02:08:20] lower left leg, which I didn't even know about for like weeks, weeks later. The right leg was
[02:08:26] definitely the problem. And the river of blood that was flowing from me to where I had initially
[02:08:32] been hit was substantial. So I know my femoral artery has been clipped. So time is, is of the
[02:08:44] essence, right? I know due to training, I have probably maybe eight to 12 minutes before I'm
[02:08:50] completely blood out. So I grab a kid, grab a tourniquet off my kid, I slap that on,
[02:08:55] wrench it down, lock in the windlass. Bleeding doesn't stop. Second one goes on. I put a second
[02:09:01] one on myself, put that down. Looks like the bleeding may have slowed down a little bit.
[02:09:08] But I can tell I'm still bleeding. A teammate gets to me and he's like, you're in bad shit.
[02:09:15] Like I had the look on his face, said everything I needed to know. He puts on a third tourniquet
[02:09:22] and then he gets IV access for blood or from meds or whatever. And I was trying to like get him
[02:09:28] away from me originally. Like I know I'm dead. Like I'm in the expecting category. Like I don't
[02:09:32] know who's doing triage right now, but I need to be with the group that isn't going to make it.
[02:09:37] I'm with the group that you don't waste your time on because I know there's a lot of people
[02:09:41] that are down right now and I know that I'm not one that can be saved. So get like get away from me.
[02:09:46] He ignores me and does what he needs to do. Third tourniquet IV access and then his work was pretty
[02:09:52] much done. So he moves on. Well, I'm still confident that I'm still bleeding out. So I'm
[02:10:02] thinking, man, have I done everything I can do? So I decided to grab some gauze out of my kit
[02:10:08] and ball it up into a little power ball, just taking gauze and creating this little ball out of it.
[02:10:15] I loosen up one of the tourniquets and I just wedge this gauze up into my thigh and I'm kind
[02:10:21] of reaching up towards my hip looking for the to feel the pulse of the ottery. And we do training
[02:10:29] to be able to do this, but it's on something else other than, you know, you. And when you're
[02:10:35] bleeding at that volume, all the blood starts to shunt inwards to your organs to protect your body
[02:10:43] to survive as long as you can. So my hands are real numb. I can't really feel anything.
[02:10:48] I think I feel something. I'm brushing past broken FEMA. My FEMA was shattered. So now the pain is
[02:10:55] really kicking in for the first time and I'm trying to stay conscious. I feel something. I think I
[02:11:01] just wedge down as hard as I can. Press that gauze in, feed the rest of the gauze in on top of it,
[02:11:07] re-secure the tourniquet on top, lock that in. And then my work there was pretty much done.
[02:11:20] You cover that in the book. You say, this is going to hurt. I rammed the power ball into my leg,
[02:11:27] reaching up toward my hip. It hurts. I'm feeling for the femoral artery. It needs direct pressure
[02:11:32] to pinch the bleeding off. The problem is the remaining blood in my system is shunting away
[02:11:37] from my extremities to protect my vital organs. My hands feel like meat mittens. Zero dexterity
[02:11:44] or fine motor skills in my fingers. The only way I can tell I'm brushing past my shattered FEMA
[02:11:50] is the shearing shockwave it sends through my body. Going unconscious seems inevitable.
[02:11:55] There it is. I think I feel a pulse inside my leg. No way to be sure, but the clock is ticking.
[02:12:03] Only a matter of minutes, if that until I am completely blood out. And only matter of seconds
[02:12:09] before I pass out. I ram the power ball down as hard as I can. The pain rips through my body,
[02:12:15] attempting to eject from my eyeballs. I feed more gauze on top of the power ball,
[02:12:20] just as our medics taught us. I re secure the tourniquet on top of it. Tighten the strap,
[02:12:25] twist the windlass, lock it in and pass out. I wake up what I think is just a few moments later.
[02:12:34] I wasn't out for long. I look at my leg and determine my work here is done.
[02:12:40] All right, that's enough sleeping on the job. Get back to work. Be there for your brothers.
[02:12:44] I drag myself maybe six feet to a teammate. He is taken around through the calf, nothing life
[02:12:51] threatening, although certainly painful. The guys have applied some interventions already,
[02:12:57] including a tourniquet, which seems to have stopped the bleeding, but he's in severe pain.
[02:13:02] Note, tourniquet save lives and essential tool, but that comes with some impressive pain for the
[02:13:07] patient. I do what I can to distract him, provide some verbal relief. My efforts create minimal
[02:13:14] effects, but it is what I feel to be the best use of whatever time I have left, which I am certain
[02:13:21] is not long. At some point, I go unconscious again. When I come to I'm being carried out on a stretcher.
[02:13:30] Seems like they are preparing me for Medevac. I am right. How long has it been? How long was I
[02:13:37] unconscious? It doesn't matter. I'm still alive. Still in the fight. The bird touches down. My
[02:13:46] teammates load me on. One of them grabs my face, looks me in the eyes and says, I love you, brother.
[02:13:56] My heart is full. What an honor to have served with such men. What an honor to die alongside such
[02:14:04] warriors.
[02:14:15] Our Medevacs and our docs and our medical military operations are so good that a lot of time,
[02:14:37] it's like, oh, if you get on the bird, if you're alive getting on the bird, there's a really good
[02:14:42] chance you're going to make it. It doesn't sound like you're thinking that way. No. I just hearing
[02:14:53] that you read that, like, puts me back in that place, man. I wasn't sure how long I had been
[02:15:04] still on the ground, but I knew it was it was quite a bit of time. So
[02:15:08] I was surprised that I was still even alive at that point.
[02:15:18] I was convinced that that was it, though. That was where it was ended.
[02:15:28] Your boys put cast all over that valley, by the way, drop all kinds of bombs. You're on the first
[02:15:34] Medevac bird out, obviously. You get to the AOB surgery clinic. And this is freaking nuts.
[02:15:48] You get you need a blood transfusion because you've lost a ton of blood. And somehow,
[02:15:55] you end up with the wrong type of blood. Wrong type of blood transfusion, which is
[02:16:01] horrible. Do you remember any of that? You're not you're not conscious at this point, are you?
[02:16:10] I remember being at that aid station. It's spotty. But I do remember getting pulled off the bird
[02:16:17] and getting thrown on the table. And then just, you know, the Med Staff scrambling to work on me.
[02:16:23] So the next they get you stable enough, or at least they think they get you stable enough
[02:16:31] to get you from the aid station to to Bagram.
[02:16:35] They don't know what the problem is with me other than I'm crashing hard. So they put me on a
[02:16:43] helicopter to send me to Bagram where there's a full scale hospital. At this location that I was at
[02:16:48] first was a full surgical team that certainly has medical capability. But once they put me on that
[02:16:54] transfusion, everything began shutting down. They didn't know why, but they knew I needed to get to
[02:16:59] Bagram immediately. It was while I was flying to Bagram, which was maybe a nine, 10 minute flight,
[02:17:06] that they realized what happened with the blood because they were given my teammate,
[02:17:10] my blood type, and they were giving me his. We have very similar last names. They both begin
[02:17:17] with LA. So they just switched up the names. Well, they're pumping him full of positive,
[02:17:22] which is my blood type, which is I'm a universal donor. I can give blood to anybody. So he's fine.
[02:17:27] But when they looked to see what they were giving him, they were like,
[02:17:31] wait a minute, and they looked to check to see what they just gave me. And it was like eight units.
[02:17:35] I mean, it was a ton. That's what they, that's when they realized what happened. So I'm airborne.
[02:17:41] And they call Bagram and they say, we just pumped Nick full of AB negative. There's no way he survives
[02:17:48] this flight. I was already in critical condition to begin with. There's no way he survives the flight,
[02:17:54] just be prepared to receive his body when he gets there. And in a lot of ways, they were right.
[02:17:58] I mean, I coded on that flight. And to your point, the flight medics were getting real creative
[02:18:05] with keeping me alive. So panels and the whole thing is out. I think they were hitting me with
[02:18:11] like shots of adrenaline and just like whatever tools they had to keep me clinging on. Pull me
[02:18:19] off the bird, get me into surgery. They take my foot off immediately. Really, I mean, it was,
[02:18:25] it was probably dead at that point, because now we're talking 90 minutes close to two hours since
[02:18:30] the point of injury. But really, it was just trying to minimize how much damage my body was
[02:18:35] trying to recover from. And then, uh, innovative dialysis, transfusion machines are just keeping
[02:18:43] me alive, you know, at this point. And that was the, that was the case for like three or four days
[02:18:50] at Bagram.
[02:18:54] What's the first thing that you remember when you come back? Where are you?
[02:18:59] I remember, um, coming to at Bagram a couple of times and I was restrained to the bed because I had
[02:19:07] been trying to rip the breathing tube out when I would wake up. When you're, when you're
[02:19:16] animated, you know, a machine is breathing for you. But when you try to breathe yourself against
[02:19:22] that, it can throw off the timing of the machine. So it feels like you're like suffocating.
[02:19:27] It's a horrible feeling. So I would, I was trying to get this tube out of my mouth when I would come to.
[02:19:33] I don't remember doing that, but I just remember coming to and being like restrained to a bed
[02:19:39] and wanting to, for someone to put me out of my misery.
[02:19:45] And then when, when do you come to again? Like, what's your next memory? When's your first full,
[02:19:50] when do they take you out of coma? When do they bring you back and let you start talking and thinking
[02:19:55] and what does that happen? I remember, um, my now wife who was deployed and working at a Bagram.
[02:20:04] I remember coming to a couple of times and seeing her bedside. I remember my sort of command, I'd be
[02:20:13] in bedside a lot talking to me. But my last real memory is when they were moving me from
[02:20:19] Bagram to load me on to a fixed wing bird to fly me to Germany, which took about five days for them
[02:20:25] to stabilize me enough to survive the flight to Germany. I remember getting loaded on that bird,
[02:20:32] which is wild. Those, those C-130s that are outfitted. It's like a hospital on, you know, with wings.
[02:20:38] I remember getting on that flight. Um, I don't remember much from Germany. I was only there a day.
[02:20:45] You know, you lost your leg at this point? No. Or your foot? No. No. Nope. Um, no recollection of
[02:20:52] that, no knowledge of that. They took my leg up to the knee at Germany and then they flew me from
[02:20:57] there to Walter Reed the next day. And I get to Walter Reed and my father was there. My mother
[02:21:05] was there. I went straight into the intensive care unit, which is where I spent the next like
[02:21:10] six weeks because it was still real touch and go. And it was around that. It was at that point that I
[02:21:15] realized my leg was, was gone or at least a part of it was gone.
[02:21:23] Did you think you were going to be, did they think was it when you realized you had lost your leg,
[02:21:29] was it above the knee or below the knee? By the time I realized it was already above the knee.
[02:21:35] Um, they had taken it above the knee at Walter Reed and the chief of ortho came in to the intensive
[02:21:44] care unit and he, he looks at me and I'm whacked out. I'm on ketamine and a lot of it, you know,
[02:21:49] I'm on a high cocktail of pain management meds. But he looks at me and he's like, Hey man, I'm
[02:21:54] Dr. So-and-so chief ortho. Here's the situation. You've been here about three or four days.
[02:22:01] Your leg, most of your leg is gone. What's left of it is riddled with bacteria and infection.
[02:22:09] Any one of these things could kill you. So my staff wants to take you into surgery right now
[02:22:16] and amputate your leg at the hip and just get rid of this problem that could kill you and just get
[02:22:22] you on with life. But I think I can save more of your leg. I think I can save more of your leg
[02:22:27] but I think I can save more of your leg. It's just going to be a street fight and I need you
[02:22:35] like in the fight with me. And I just met this guy, you know, he's telling me that
[02:22:41] this problem could kill me at any moment, but he wants to like slug it out with me. And I don't
[02:22:47] think I really processed medically what he was saying. I just heard like, let's get into a fight
[02:22:52] together. Do you want to do that? And I was like, yes. Who's got we taking? Yeah. Yeah, right.
[02:22:58] Who's got we taking? We're going to hurt some people and you can never ask me about it again.
[02:23:01] Who's got we taking? That was that was it. I think I just heard that and I said, let's do that.
[02:23:07] And he said, okay. So that began my regiment of surgeries three or four times a week. And they
[02:23:17] were just going in and amputating more and more and more cutting out dead tissue, cutting out more
[02:23:22] bone. Monday, Wednesday, Friday was kind of my typical routine. And then flushing me with antibiotics,
[02:23:29] hoping that the infection would get taken care of. And then it was just rinse and repeat like that
[02:23:33] for, you know, a month or so, five weeks, six weeks, something like that until the infection
[02:23:38] eventually stopped, which left me with pretty much what I have today.
[02:23:42] Oh, yeah, let's do it. You got a section in here where you're talking about as you begin
[02:23:53] as you begin rehab. So you get right into it says on one particular day, I was walking my
[02:24:01] laps around the track. So I'm fast forwarding a little bit, right? Obviously, there's and when
[02:24:06] you get the book, you can get some of these other details. I'm fast forward a little bit.
[02:24:10] One particular day I was walking my laps around the track one step at a time.
[02:24:14] It was packed. In fact, in fact, a bunch of New York Yankees were there visiting service members.
[02:24:19] I typically avoided these meet and greet moments like the plague when I was working. Kelly knew
[02:24:24] this and Kelly was your rehab physical therapist physical therapist. Kelly knew this and did an
[02:24:31] amazing job of shielding me from unnecessary distractions. I'm pretty sure she literally
[02:24:34] hissed at a dude one time like an angry cat. Given that on this day, it was the Yankees. I was
[02:24:39] even less interested. Go socks. I was in a good stride. My prosthetic had had a solid fit that
[02:24:47] day and I needed to push it. I decided to hold a 90 pound barbell straight overhead in order to
[02:24:52] increase the difficulty. Off I went shoulders burning core burning glutes burning perfect.
[02:24:58] We were working. I picked up speed. I didn't have a set number of laps in mind. I just planned
[02:25:02] on going until I couldn't go anymore. My body began to twitch uncontrollably. Fatigue set in.
[02:25:08] I was right at muscle failure. I got one more lap in me. Let's go. I rounded the corner of the track
[02:25:13] and lost my balance. I already knew how this was going to play out. My wipeout was of epic
[02:25:17] proportions. The barbell went one way, my body, the other and my prosthetic detached completely.
[02:25:23] It was a totally yard sale. The barbell slammed on the floor, clanging around, looking for a
[02:25:27] target. It found the legs of a physical therapist who was coaching a patient through a stationary
[02:25:31] bike workout. The therapist fell on her back with a thud knocking the wind out of her. My body went
[02:25:37] flailing into a rack of medicine balls neatly organized according to weight. The heavier ones
[02:25:41] at the bottom, the lighter ones at top, all of which were now bouncing or rolling in all directions
[02:25:46] through the facility. The photo op with the Yankees stopped. The stretches stopped. All
[02:25:51] conversations stopped. Everything stopped. As I lay on the ground, I conducted a quick damage
[02:25:55] assessment. Fingers, arms, leg, head, everything seemed to be functioning. The therapist I knocked
[02:26:00] over regained her breathing ability. I asked if she was all right. She was fine and asked the
[02:26:06] same of me. I looked around the gym to see that nobody had moved an inch. Nobody, including Kelly,
[02:26:11] had made the slightest attempt to either slow me down before I wrecked or come to my aid once I did.
[02:26:16] It was business as usual. I strapped my leg back on and staggered over to Kelly. The only damage
[02:26:22] was to my pride. You good? She asked. Yeah, I'm good. Think I didn't swing completely through
[02:26:30] and my foot hit the ground behind me. Yeah, that sounds right. Now go pick up those med balls and
[02:26:35] meet me over at the squat rack. So you're freaking good. How long was it? How long was it that you
[02:26:42] were like laid up? You're getting the surgeries before you got fitted for a prosthetic and all
[02:26:47] that? Yeah, I got fitted for my first prosthetic probably 10, 12 weeks after getting there.
[02:26:54] And which is, you know, a monumental step in the process. Unfortunately, this is quite common.
[02:27:00] I needed a couple surgical revisions after that had happened, which is really difficult to deal with
[02:27:06] because it pretty much puts you back at square one. You know, your leg changes shape. The swelling
[02:27:12] sets in. You have to wait until you can get recast it for another prosthetic. It kind of starts
[02:27:17] that clock over again. I had to go through that twice, you know, in those setbacks. And I talk
[02:27:22] about this often, you know, like that's what separates those that can continue to make the
[02:27:27] strides. And oftentimes is what just derails people. They just can't deal with that, with that
[02:27:33] setback. How long was this like a five week, eight week setback? Yeah, no, I'd say maybe around three
[02:27:38] or four. Okay. But they don't man, that's freaking, you know, yeah, it's tough because you're making
[02:27:43] that you can see the progress you're making and then boom, you're back to where you were. And this
[02:27:47] is like a revision. They do surgery. They fit you with a prosthetic. You start walking on all of
[02:27:52] a sudden like the way your bone is, is jacked up or it's sticking out or something. And they've
[02:27:57] got to go in there and shave that thing down. Yep. Exactly that. And then you got to get all
[02:28:02] healed up and start again. Yeah. So what you just read was probably around July timeframe,
[02:28:10] where I was done with surgeries. And I was really making substantial progress, working with my
[02:28:16] prosthetic. I got to the hospital and match. So, you know, a few months after that was when I was
[02:28:23] done with surgeries completely. And I was really getting after it. Freaking walking around with
[02:28:30] a prosthetic with 90 pound barbell over your head. Yeah. You were going freaking hard. I was,
[02:28:38] I was, I mean, my level of obsession, because I could already see where I was going. Like I knew
[02:28:45] what was in front of me was getting back to the team that happened in the hospital.
[02:28:49] Even before I was on a prosthetic, I was like, I'm going back to my lifestyle and my profession.
[02:28:55] So these training sessions, this was, this was my life. Yeah. You immediately knew you're going
[02:29:00] to go back to an ODA. 100%. Which by the way, in case this wasn't clear, you have no leg.
[02:29:07] Right. And you're saying I'm going back to an ODA. Right. People are actually trying to get you
[02:29:13] to freaking chill out and trying to, you know, that's kind of a funny way of saying it, but people
[02:29:19] are actually trying to get you to adjust your expectations for your life. And you have a section
[02:29:26] in here where it's one of those scenarios. April 2013, my father tells this story better than I do,
[02:29:35] as I heard it only second hand, but on one particular day, a psych came in to visit me
[02:29:40] and I had just been wheeled out for surgery. My father told the doc the deal and they began
[02:29:45] talking a bit. The psych explained to my father that I was continuously talking about returning to
[02:29:51] my job on an SF detachment, doing the same things I had done before, etc. He further explained to
[02:29:57] my father that he felt I was perhaps in a state of shock or denial, simply due to the drugs not
[02:30:03] yet aware of the severity of my situation. He essentially warned my father that at some point
[02:30:09] I would be made aware of how badly I was injured and that the likelihood of me doing what I intended
[02:30:14] to do was extraordinarily unlikely, perhaps impossible. He simply wanted my father to be
[02:30:19] prepared to deal with what could potentially be a dramatic severe fall into depression.
[02:30:26] In hindsight, I may have had the same thoughts and concerns as he did. After all, I was on an
[02:30:31] enormous amount of medication. I was in surgery three times a week and I had expressed my intentions
[02:30:36] were unpro— and my expressed intentions were unprecedented. Additionally, I am positive he
[02:30:42] had seen this cause and effect happen throughout his medical career. So I get it. No hard feelings,
[02:30:48] doc. My father expressed his appreciation for the information and analysis before telling the psych
[02:30:54] that he didn't like— that he didn't see that as likely to happen. My father explained that he
[02:30:59] felt I knew what was going on. I had amazingly accepted the reality of my situation and just as
[02:31:05] quickly had already focused on the next evolution. He told the doc this is just who Nick is.
[02:31:11] My father knows me as well as anybody. He's my best friend in this world. He knew that I knew
[02:31:17] my current situation and that even while doped up with enough painkillers and anesthesia to kill
[02:31:24] a horse, I was already formulating a plan. Freakin' ready to rock, man.
[02:31:38] You were there. Just mentally there. Yeah, man. I was at— how long are you in Waltz Reed for?
[02:31:46] About a year. Total. And that you just— you report in here that it was great for you. Like,
[02:32:00] the medical support that you got, the people there, the people that were training you were just
[02:32:05] freaking good to go. Amazing.
[02:32:07] How is it happening? How does it progress? Like, what happens when the chain of command
[02:32:16] here is that you want to come back? What are they saying?
[02:32:19] So, I mean, I was in communication with them while I was in the hospital and they come visit me
[02:32:24] every now and then and we just maintain comms. But it wasn't so much about tell me what your—
[02:32:30] what your goals are when you get back. It was just how you're doing. Do you need anything? Has
[02:32:33] your family, right? That was the focus. When I left Walter Reed and got back to Bragg,
[02:32:40] I reported back over to their group and I met with the group command team
[02:32:45] the first day in their office. And of course, they're like, welcome back. You look great.
[02:32:51] I'm still early on in the process. I've been in amputee for about a year. So,
[02:32:56] I'm no physical specimen. I'm still hobbling. I'm still limping. I'm still trying to figure
[02:33:01] out how to live life with one leg and I'm sitting in their office. And they eventually asked me,
[02:33:06] so, like, what are your goals? What are you looking to do? And I told them that. I was like,
[02:33:10] I'm going back to the team. And they just said, okay, is that something that you think you can
[02:33:20] do now? And I said, no, no, no, no. I have a lot of work I still need to do. But that's where things
[02:33:25] are going. In the interim, you know, I need a job. I need to provide value here. So, I requested to
[02:33:33] go to the combatives committee to work as an instructor. So, it's a great fit, you know,
[02:33:38] a long time, like combatives dude. And they granted that request. I haven't talked to these guys,
[02:33:46] you know, years later about this exact moment. They'll, they'll, they'll, they'll, I've all told
[02:33:52] me, like we had to do everything in our power to hold back, like the crazy one-eyed look, like,
[02:33:57] what did you just say? Or go down the expectation management kind of brief, that I was getting
[02:34:05] quite a bit at the hospital. They had to fight the urge to do both of those things. And just stay
[02:34:10] kind of cool and neutral. Because they wanted to be supportive of me, right? But as a leader,
[02:34:17] right? Like you also want to be practical to a degree. So, you know, I understand that. They
[02:34:24] didn't think that what I intended to do was, was possible. I didn't think that that was going to
[02:34:30] happen. But they did grant me the request to work as an instructor. And that's when the game really,
[02:34:37] like went up significantly. Because as amazing as the staff is at Walter Reed, their job is to
[02:34:42] keep you alive. And they get you as functional as you can be to live the rest of your life
[02:34:46] with whatever condition you're dealing with. They're not there to train someone to go back
[02:34:51] to an ODA. That's not their job. The guys in my unit, that is their job. So I knew I needed to get
[02:34:57] back to Bragg ASAP to begin training with those guys and gals. First, they needed a job, which my
[02:35:06] unit gave me. And then I knew I needed to fight this thing administratively, which I didn't know
[02:35:10] what that looked like. But I knew it was going to trigger a medical evaluation board, which I referred
[02:35:16] to as a military eviction board, because that's really what they're like, programmed to do. And
[02:35:23] in their defense, most of the guys or gals or service members that they see are looking to
[02:35:28] transition out. So they do place a lot of emphasis on, let's make sure we get your VA rating where it
[02:35:33] needs to be all the documentation, get you maybe an internship for what life looks like as a civilian.
[02:35:38] That's what they're there to do. And I walked in and I'm like, I'm going back to the team.
[02:35:44] And the first person I got linked up with that kind of quarterback you through that process,
[02:35:49] just didn't get it. He just didn't get it. And I fired that guy, which I didn't know I could do.
[02:35:58] But I threw enough of a tepidantrum and talked to his boss. And I was like, you either need to get
[02:36:04] me someone who's on the same page as me, or I'm just going to do this myself. So he was cool.
[02:36:08] He linked me up with this girl who was amazing. My name is Rachel. And she had worked with
[02:36:13] some SF guys that remained on active duty. So she became my girl and she was on the same page as me.
[02:36:22] The admin fight happened at that point, which took about eight months of time.
[02:36:27] So I'm working as an instructor day to day. And I've really just taken the same mentality I had
[02:36:35] at Walter Reed, which in a lot of ways is easier to maintain this because you're living in this
[02:36:40] bubble where your only job is to go to these appointments and you're like living at Walter
[02:36:44] Reed. Once you get home, you got your friends. In my instance, I had my girl who I moved in with.
[02:36:51] Like, does it do these other factors that a part of your life that can distract you or detract from
[02:36:59] the mission? So I had to take the same mentality I had in the hospital and apply that to a normal
[02:37:05] living environment. And with just within the first week of being home, I had to make some real hard
[02:37:12] choices and eliminate anything that didn't need to be there, complete and total reevaluation of how
[02:37:20] I spend every single minute of my day. And if you didn't need to be there, if it didn't need to be there,
[02:37:24] both tasks and people, it was removed. And with tasks, I think it's easier to say, I'm not going
[02:37:33] to watch Netflix anymore. But when you start talking about removing relationships from your life,
[02:37:37] that can be real difficult to do. And I sat down with my now wife. And this is like the courting
[02:37:45] phase of our relationship, right? Like she was in Afghanistan when I got banged up.
[02:37:50] And what was she doing in Afghanistan? What was her job?
[02:37:53] She's active duty. At the time, she was doing psychological operations.
[02:37:57] Got it. But we hadn't spent any real time together. And then I move in with her. And within the first
[02:38:05] week, I sit down with her. I said, Hey, babe, here's the deal. I'm going all in.
[02:38:11] Hey, just real quick. When you're communicating with your significant other, a good way to not
[02:38:18] start this conversation is, Hey, look, here's the deal. So we're getting off to a good start, bro.
[02:38:23] Yeah. All right. Here's the deal. It was the truth, though. Like there was no alternative.
[02:38:29] This is the deal. This isn't like a course of action. This is the way it's going to be.
[02:38:34] I just wanted to be transparent. I'm going all in on this, like complete and total, burn the boats.
[02:38:41] Like, I'm either going to be successful, or I'm going to die trying. That's it. Not negotiable.
[02:38:46] I have to do this. And what that means on the tactical level is that there are no dinners.
[02:38:53] There's no, we're going to go to this wedding. There's no like nothing, nothing, everything gone.
[02:38:59] It's each sleep train repeat until I get successful or they kick me out of the army. That's it.
[02:39:07] And I look back at that conversation now with the family we have, we're married now,
[02:39:15] six years, two young kids, the highlight of my life, most important thing in my life by a mile.
[02:39:22] And all that could have very easily just non-existed if she didn't have the strength to
[02:39:29] be okay with the somewhat craziness that I was communicating to her.
[02:39:36] So I'm incredibly grateful that that happened. It can be tough to talk about because
[02:39:44] it could have all just not been a thing. She was like, okay, Roger that.
[02:39:51] And I think what enabled that was she was also aggressively pursuing her next echelon,
[02:39:58] her next evolution in her career. So she was really dialed in professionally as well.
[02:40:02] So we were both going down in parallel these hyper-focused roads towards our professional
[02:40:08] ambitions at the same time, which helped because she had stuff that she needed to do,
[02:40:14] stuff I needed to do. We'd come together when we could, but it was an interesting
[02:40:17] introduction to our relationship with all this was going on.
[02:40:22] So eight month process of a med board, I'm working as an instructor and I'm just living
[02:40:28] just this completely and total dialed in, minute to minute, hour to hour lifestyle.
[02:40:35] Obviously a lot of physical training was involved. And after about eight months,
[02:40:42] med board complete, the army allowed me to stay in on active duty. Then that check,
[02:40:48] that box was checked and then it was, okay, now I need to get back to the team.
[02:40:51] And now I need to figure out how to go about doing that.
[02:40:55] And it sounds like there's a really specific list of things that you needed to be able to do.
[02:41:02] Like, is it some kind of test, like a fit for duty test? Is that like there was certain tasks
[02:41:08] you had to be able to do? And where's that list come from?
[02:41:13] It was created in real time by my chain of command. There wasn't this laid out pipeline.
[02:41:22] It started off simple. It was go do an army physical fitness test.
[02:41:25] Okay, you did that. And then they threw every army physical fitness program of record at me.
[02:41:32] And once I checked all those blocks, then they started just throwing other stuff at me.
[02:41:39] So they had me, I was getting evaluated cognitively,
[02:41:45] proficiency, they ran me back over to the 18 Bravo committee, which is where I learned how to
[02:41:50] be an 18 Bravo, they threw me back over there for like a one week, two week, train up evaluation
[02:41:56] to see if I can still do my job as a Bravo. They put me in front of psych screening, which
[02:42:01] which no one's admitted this to me yet directly. But I'm confident when I say I was, I was operating
[02:42:08] at such an insane pace and intensity that people thought I was like legitimately crazy.
[02:42:15] You know, people thought I had like a diagnosable problem, whether that was delusional or like
[02:42:20] psychopathic. Like we need to get this guy's mental well being checked out. Cause I think
[02:42:24] he's insane and needs like treatment. The site came back and was like, yeah, he's no crazier
[02:42:29] than he was before. So he's, he's good at this time you're teaching combatives,
[02:42:34] which is who you're teaching combatives to, is it within your own battalion or is it like
[02:42:37] who you teach in combatives to the group? So third group, so third group, you're teaching combatives,
[02:42:43] you're, and then you're just PT and to try and get to be able to do this job. Yep. PT and doing
[02:42:49] a ton of Jiu-Jitsu, competing in Jiu-Jitsu as well, which is a huge part of this overall journey
[02:42:55] is what is that piece of it that not just from a training perspective, but just mentality and
[02:43:00] structure and like technical focus on what I'm doing, adaptation to how do I, how do I do this
[02:43:06] with just one limb now, one leg now. Were you like a purple belt when this thing kicked off?
[02:43:11] No, I was a white belt. I got my blue and my purple after I lost my leg.
[02:43:20] But you trained before you lost your leg. I did. Yeah. I trained. I got into Jiu-Jitsu right after
[02:43:25] I really, I graduated the Q course. So I did that on two legs for a while. And then my Jiu-Jitsu
[02:43:30] journey as an APT started at Walter Reed, they had a local black belt who owned a studio downtown
[02:43:35] Washington who would come to the hospital one day a week. Who's that? Jose. It's like Ortiz.
[02:43:43] His name. Good on him. Awesome dude. I met him at the hospital and then I began training. He
[02:43:48] invited me over into his, into his dojo. So I began training there like three, four nights a week.
[02:43:53] You know, one thing that you, and I forget if I'm going to cover this or not in the book,
[02:43:58] but I want to talk about it anyways. You got this thing that really like struck a chord with me.
[02:44:04] So you explain that when you got a prosthetic, when you put that thing on, there's a clock that
[02:44:11] starts because you can only wear it for so long. And there's a bunch of factors. If it's hot out,
[02:44:18] what activity you're doing. And it made you, that was one of the things that kind of drove this,
[02:44:24] this efficiency in you. Cause you go, okay, when I get this thing on, I have X amount of hours to
[02:44:30] operate walking around. And after that, I got to take it off. And that's, that was one of the
[02:44:36] things you said, okay, as soon as I get this thing on, here's what I got to get done. And that struck
[02:44:41] a chord with me. Cause like that's the attitude you should have regardless in life is like, oh,
[02:44:47] you're going to wake up today. You only have so many hours, but that put a, put an exclamation
[02:44:51] point on that for you. Yeah. I'd say that, you know, having been in the military and special ops
[02:44:57] for, for a bit before this, I was used to living, you know, structured discipline lifestyle, but
[02:45:03] the forcing function of knowing I needed to be able to execute at the highest possible level.
[02:45:09] In order to do that, I needed to be as efficient as possible. You said it, it was about efficiency.
[02:45:13] How do I maximize every moment I have upright on two legs? And I got, I developed a bit of OCD on
[02:45:21] that because if I would, if I would go to leave my house and I would leave something and I'd walk
[02:45:26] 12 steps before I realized I forgot it, that would, that would irritate me because now that's,
[02:45:32] that's 24 steps. I'm not getting back. So there's a, there's a glitch in my system. There's a glitch
[02:45:37] in my, in my protocol. Things aren't prepped where they need to be. This mistake can't happen.
[02:45:43] Again, cause I just lost 24 steps. So I mean, I was dissecting like where I put my phone,
[02:45:49] my keys, my walk, like to the, like to the inch within my life so that I didn't lose 24 steps
[02:45:56] ever again. You were freaking committed to this thing. How, what was the, what was the biggest
[02:46:04] challenge as you, as they threw all these different tests at you, right? They're throwing the army
[02:46:09] PT test at you. They throw this other test at you. What was something that really was a challenger?
[02:46:16] What was the hardest thing? Yeah, the final, the final physical evaluation,
[02:46:20] which was my final overall evaluation was the, was by five, the hottest one. This was at the end
[02:46:24] of about 12 weeks where I was doing one or two assessments a week. And third group, again,
[02:46:32] only operated in Afghanistan. They were dealing with a lot of injuries. So third group took it
[02:46:37] upon themselves to create what they called originally the return to duty physical fitness
[02:46:42] assessment. And that was specifically for guys that were wounded that wanted to go back to
[02:46:46] operational status. They spent months putting this thing together. This was while I was at the hospital.
[02:46:52] And they were telling me about it a little bit and they developed it out. They ran, you know, able
[02:46:58] body guys through it to develop the standards. And it was more of more tasks that were more in line
[02:47:04] with a combat scenario. So as opposed to just, you know, push up setups and running, it was
[02:47:10] tactical tasks like move to cover type drills. Everything's done with a 50 pound weighted vest
[02:47:16] to simulate kit. Most were done with a rubber duck rifle. So it was more tactical tasks,
[02:47:23] 12 events in total. Well, the day before I took mine, this was like my Super Bowl.
[02:47:28] And my training for about six weeks or so leading up to that point was mostly focused on those
[02:47:36] particular tasks. The day before I went in the gym just to loosen up, get some blood flow, get ready
[02:47:45] for my next for the test to happen the following morning. And the group command sergeant major and
[02:47:52] another dude who had been shot through the hand who was trying to go back to the team,
[02:47:56] to the team, they both took it that morning. So I walk in the gym to loosen up and they're both
[02:48:02] sprawled out on the turf, drenched and exhausted. Group command sergeant major is Mark Eckard.
[02:48:08] He just recently retired. He was the most recent use of socks CSM. He's a stud. He's a PT stud able
[02:48:15] body dude stud. He's out on the turf, both of them. I walk over and hey, Sergeant Major, how you doing?
[02:48:23] He's like, not great because that test just kicked my ass. He's like, you're taking this thing
[02:48:28] tomorrow morning. I said, yeah, he's like, this thing's no joke. And I knew it was brutal. I had
[02:48:35] never taken it entirely in its entirety to standard once because I knew it was going to break me off.
[02:48:42] So in my training, I was playing around with different resistances, but I would just lump
[02:48:47] together different groups of them and go back to back to back in repetition. I said, yeah,
[02:48:53] tomorrow morning, he's like, okay, well, I'll be here. You know, good luck. I said, thank you.
[02:48:56] So I show up the next morning. Group command team, battalion command team, company command team,
[02:49:02] and about 50 other dudes are all there. There's a massive entourage. They basically closed the gym.
[02:49:08] Or at least no one was training because everyone was just there to watch. There's my teammates are
[02:49:12] there. And I knocked that out. And the final event on this thing is it doesn't sound bad,
[02:49:22] but it's actually quite miserable. The 12th event and I think you had, I think it was two minutes
[02:49:26] in between each event. The final one, the 12th one is just as a walk on an incline of treadmill.
[02:49:35] And it starts off flat and then every two minutes it increases in elevation. So at the final point,
[02:49:42] you're walking at a 45 degree angle, which is steep. It's at a slow pace, you know, it's like a fast
[02:49:49] like a brisk walk. So you're doing this 50 pound weighted vest 12th event. Well, my issue, similar
[02:49:55] to the way I wiped out there, Walter Reed, was because of the lack of range of motion I have in
[02:49:59] my hip. When the angle is that steep, I can't get my foot out in front of me. So I had to develop
[02:50:07] a technique where once it hit a certain degree of elevation, I would rotate my body laterally.
[02:50:13] And I would laterally shuffle uphill. So my, my, my prosthetic is the trail leg,
[02:50:21] my sound leg is the uphill leg. And that's essentially just pulling me up. So I'm doing
[02:50:26] this little sidewards lateral gallop up this hill, which just looks crazy. So I finish
[02:50:37] event complete. I'm on the verge of passing out. I'm on the verge of going to see the wizard.
[02:50:42] I'm losing peripheral vision. It's getting real spockly around me. And I'm standing there trying
[02:50:48] to look tough. Like I could do it again if I needed to. And groups see us then comes over and he
[02:50:54] says, Amen, you know, I just took this test yesterday and it kicked my ass. He's like,
[02:50:59] if I wasn't here to witness you just do what you just did, I would never believe that that was
[02:51:05] possible. And this is at the end of 12 weeks. And I'm like, all right, dude, thank you. But like,
[02:51:11] what else do you need from me? You know, which my teammates were kind of laughing. I'm talking to
[02:51:16] the group command, Sajam measure. And I'm like, thanks for the thanks for that. But like, what,
[02:51:19] like, what's next? Come on, man, what else, what else is it going to take? He looks over the group
[02:51:25] commander. And he just goes, Hey, Mark, this is your decision. But I don't know how we're going
[02:51:30] to tell this dude no, after what we just put him through. So he mocked at good look to me. And he
[02:51:37] goes, All right, man, you'll have your orders come Monday, and you'll be back back on the team.
[02:51:46] You have a section here in the book, you got a few sections like this in the book where you
[02:51:50] where you have other people that knew you or that know you chime in. You got a section here about
[02:51:57] this. This is by a master Sergeant Jimmy Rooney. And he writes, the ORT is an extremely difficult
[02:52:04] assessment even for able bodied men. Some events are arguably, arguably impossible for an above the
[02:52:10] knee amputee such as the depth drop. In this event, an individual must climb up a four foot
[02:52:15] platform wearing 50 pound weighted vest, jump off, make an athletic landing without touching the
[02:52:20] ground with his hands. Nick's mechanical knee was incapable of articulating in a dynamic fashion,
[02:52:27] and prevented him from sticking the landing. For weeks, Nick drilled this event starting on one
[02:52:31] foot platform with no additional weight and gradually increasing height and weight over time.
[02:52:36] The method he developed to complete this event was to land in a pistol squat position,
[02:52:41] essentially a single leg squat landing. The guys and I watched him practices over and over again.
[02:52:47] The mere thought of doing this myself made my knees and hips hurt. But Nick insisted it was
[02:52:51] possible he meticulously measured out the distance from the platform to where his heel needed to
[02:52:55] land marking it with tape on the ground too far forward, you'd fall backward upon landing too
[02:53:00] close to the platform and his knee may explode. He approached this event like a science experiment,
[02:53:05] a problem that needed to be solved through trial, error, and work. On the day of Nick's
[02:53:09] final physical assessment, the ORT felt as if the entire unit was present. Nick was attempting to
[02:53:14] make history as the first above the knee amputee to return not just to an ODA, but to an ODA set
[02:53:21] once again to deploy to Afghanistan to conduct combat operations. Everybody was in all watching
[02:53:27] him perform. When he completed the last event with our entire command and attendance, he was
[02:53:32] given approval to return to the team. It was one of the most memorable moments we shared.
[02:53:37] So how did Nick put his mind and body in such a positive, motivated, and influential place to
[02:53:43] become so well known as not only one of the most aggressive warriors, but also a life coach, teacher,
[02:53:49] and mentor, I believe Nick's outlook on his environment is where it started. He had to determine
[02:53:55] what it was that he wanted in life and set a plan to achieve it. Nick could have easily become negative
[02:54:01] and bitter and could have medically retired out of the military. Nobody would have fought less
[02:54:05] of him for doing so. He had been through a lot. Instead, Nick chose to pursue what he identified
[02:54:13] as his purpose. I feel the key to Nick's success is that he clearly stated his intent and it gave
[02:54:19] him a reason to get out of bed every morning. This only grew as he continued achieving goals
[02:54:24] along the way. And Nick may not realize it, but he became a model for success in every aspect
[02:54:30] of being a phenomenal green beret and leader. His fear, his sphere of positive influence encapsulate
[02:54:36] encapsulates everybody he comes in contact with. Complaining around Nick is impossible.
[02:54:42] Giving anything less than 100% around Nick is not an option. His actions raise the bar for the rest
[02:54:49] of us to match. His presence makes us better. What did Nick do to get where he is today?
[02:54:55] Plain and simple. Nick embodies intestinal fortitude and cares about the men and the mission.
[02:55:07] Hell yeah. Freakin insane, right? Jumping off the four foot thing, landing on one leg. Come on,
[02:55:16] man. That's freaking savage. What was your mock max squat when you had two legs? Do you know?
[02:55:25] Back in my, when I was like big, big, before I came into the military, I was around, I was in the
[02:55:31] 600s. What do you think your one leg, like, is it stronger now than it was then? My one leg?
[02:55:40] Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. That thing is just like a freaking savage. Yeah. That's the most savage leg
[02:55:45] on the planet. It has to be. It has to be. So, you know, there's, there's, there's one more thing
[02:55:57] I want to read about this before we get into some of your other, you know, moving on from here.
[02:56:06] It just going back, it's a little reflection on the whole scenario, but I think it's an important
[02:56:10] thing to read. You say on March 11, 2013, we were set to conduct a routine operation. As always,
[02:56:17] our partner force gathered outside our camp, the leadership entered a wire to receive the mission
[02:56:22] brief. Only this time a truck also drove in. I noticed immediately that it wasn't right.
[02:56:27] I was pissed. Do I address this now? I thought to myself, it seems obvious that the answer
[02:56:32] was emphatically in the affirmative. Why wouldn't I? The answer to that question is rapport.
[02:56:38] This is a tough balance and arguably the most critical factor for an ODA's success.
[02:56:42] Fostering and maintaining relationships are the keys when conducting partnered operations.
[02:56:48] I decided to hold off. I would address this with my detachment commander after and he would address
[02:56:54] it with the partner force leadership. This was a decision I must live with for the rest of my life.
[02:57:01] This truck was a Ford Ranger with a mounted PKM in the bed. This is the weapon that would
[02:57:06] happen that would moments later rip my body to shreds drastically altering the rest of my life.
[02:57:11] But this result is not the reason for my regret. The loss of my leg is not why I spring up sweating
[02:57:20] in the middle of the night. Living the rest of my life as an amputee is not why I continue to
[02:57:25] reanalyze my decision making process on that day. Our detachment commander, Captain Andrew
[02:57:33] Peterson, Keele, our infantry uplift squad leader, Staff Sergeant Rex Shad, and our military working
[02:57:41] dog, Back, were all killed in action as a result of my decision.
[02:57:49] It took years to be able to look at this event and extract positive value. The pain was too great.
[02:57:56] I couldn't see past my anger and the disappointment with myself. I couldn't see past the faces of
[02:58:02] my brothers who paid the ultimate sacrifice. It took time. It took a lot of reflection.
[02:58:10] It was hard, but I owed them this effort so their deaths were not for nothing.
[02:58:17] Gradually, I was able to gather the lessons learned. Internal security, SOPs,
[02:58:24] partner force relationship dynamics, and John Boyd's Oodaloop cycle are just a few examples of
[02:58:31] what was extracted. We used our experience to better educate ourselves and those around us
[02:58:36] in order to minimize the likelihood of a future similar tragedy.
[02:58:42] The loss of these men brought value to those who remain in the fight.
[02:58:48] How many lives have been saved because of their sacrifice? There's no way to ever know,
[02:58:52] but I'm certain it is substantial. The insider attack on March 11th, 2013 is considered to this
[02:59:00] day the most catastrophic insider attack since the start of the global war on terrorism.
[02:59:06] It is referenced in schools and training events throughout the soft community.
[02:59:11] As painful as it remains, we have managed to pull the positive value from this tragedy.
[02:59:18] We must get better. We owe this to the fallen.
[02:59:22] Yeah, you and I were talking when we weren't recording.
[02:59:38] For me, I had a blue on blue incident in Ramadi that I was in charge of. A friendly Iraqi soldier
[02:59:44] was killed several more were wounded. One of my guys was wounded. What I did when I got home was
[02:59:55] debrief that event to every SEAL team on the West Coast that was going on deployment.
[03:00:02] I had many times guys come back and say, hey, I was in the situation. We had this element over
[03:00:10] here, that element over here. If I wouldn't have known and trained to avoid blue on blues,
[03:00:16] the 100% would have happened. I was just saying to you that you're telling this story.
[03:00:24] Look, man, there's special operations guys working around the world right now as we speak with
[03:00:30] countless partner forces all over the place. This is a lesson that everybody will not forget.
[03:00:42] I know that the blue on blue that we had early in deployment saved lives later in deployment
[03:00:47] because we would have had, there's other things. I talk about an extreme ownership.
[03:00:53] I had a freaking Bradley want to put 25 millimeter chain gun on what they thought was enemy
[03:01:02] element on a rooftop. That enemy element was actually my guys.
[03:01:08] Laef talks about in there, he had Chris Kyle identify, hey, there's, I see a person with a
[03:01:14] scope weapon in this building. Do you want me to shoot him? Laef's checking with the army.
[03:01:18] Do you guys have anyone in this building? And they're like, no, kill that sniper. And Chris didn't
[03:01:23] feel comfortable taking the shot and didn't take it. And luckily he didn't because we were so sensitive
[03:01:29] to blue on blue. And so the lessons coming away from this guaranteed. You say you don't know how
[03:01:37] many lives they've saved and we'll never be able to know how many lives they've saved, but no doubt
[03:01:42] the level of caution and making sure that assessment is happening all the time.
[03:01:46] That's what we got to take away from these things for sure. I have to.
[03:01:56] You know, another thing that I breezed over a little bit is the fact that as you
[03:02:04] are focused on you and you're focused on your goal of like, hey, I'm going to get back to an ODA
[03:02:10] team at some point along that journey before you took that final physical test, you looked in the
[03:02:19] mirror and thought to yourself, wait a second, this isn't about me. And you know, you're going over,
[03:02:27] if you can't do your job, it's not just about you. It's about the guys you might let down.
[03:02:34] It's about do they want me on the team? Do they want, do they feel like there's going to be slacked
[03:02:39] that they're going to have to pick up for me? Talk about that kind of, you had some legit
[03:02:45] heart to heart conversations with the guys that you would be working with about the situation
[03:02:51] that you were in and whether you should proceed down that path because it wasn't just about you.
[03:02:55] You got 11 other guys that are counting on you to be able to carry the weight.
[03:03:00] Yeah, and not just the 11, but the families as well. And you're right. I was in a tunnel,
[03:03:08] my tunnel vision during that first phase about it was about me being successful, doing what I
[03:03:16] knew I needed to do, proving that they say is wrong, proving myself right, all that kind of stuff.
[03:03:21] It was about me. And once I began going through this assessment, I'm knocking one out after
[03:03:28] another, boom, boom, boom. Right around that time, I woke up in the middle of the night in a panic
[03:03:35] because I realized in that moment that I was going back to a team and I hadn't thought about them
[03:03:40] once before. And these are guys that are around me. They're in the gym, we're training together.
[03:03:46] I'm seeing them all the time, but I was so target fixated on me doing what I needed to do that I
[03:03:50] didn't consider them. And it's just, it scared the hell out of me. So that very, that day at work,
[03:03:59] I tracked down a couple of the guys that were local, had some phone conversations with some guys that
[03:04:05] were off site doing some stuff. And I was like, guys, I apologize for having not even done this
[03:04:11] up until this point, but is this within the best interest of the team? You guys are supportive
[03:04:16] and you're in my corner, but are you doing that just because you care about me and you want me
[03:04:22] to be happy? Have you guys thought about this? Because I haven't. And I don't think I can do
[03:04:28] this. I don't think I can give this an objective look because I'm so obsessed with success. I need
[03:04:33] you guys there to do that. And this was maybe four or five different conversations. And I got pretty
[03:04:40] much the same answer from all of them. And they said, listen, dude, we've all talked about this
[03:04:45] already amongst ourselves. And the, the high truth is, is we don't know if this is going to work.
[03:04:52] But what I can promise you is we want you to keep working towards it. We will be the ones to tell you
[03:05:00] if this isn't going to work. If you're able to make it back, we'll assess the situation then.
[03:05:07] And we'll make that hard call for you so you don't have to. So I had to put my trust into them and
[03:05:12] my teammates to be able to look at it objectively that way. And Jimmy Rooney, who you just read about,
[03:05:19] he was set to take the team as the team sergeant. He may have already taken it at that point,
[03:05:25] but he and I were working together when I was working as an instructor. He was the head instructor
[03:05:30] of our safari committee, Special Forces Advanced Urban Combat Committee. And we work at our offices
[03:05:36] right down the hall. We worked together, that committee and the combatives committee. So we had
[03:05:40] a working relationship. And it wasn't till much farther down the road that he told me he was going
[03:05:46] to take 2-6, take my team. And he was the last one I talked to on that day at work. And we had a
[03:05:54] candid emotional conversation. And he said the same thing. And hearing it from him as the guy that I
[03:06:02] know is going to put the best interest of the team above all else, because that's his job,
[03:06:07] I can trust him and the guys to give me that no shit objective feedback. So once I made that switch
[03:06:17] about wanting to pursue my own goal versus, and the reason behind that,
[03:06:24] to it being about them. And when I'm walking into my fourth training session for the day and I'm
[03:06:31] exhausted and tired and beat up, rather than thinking about taking those first steps off the
[03:06:37] plane in Afghanistan with my arms raised in the year, I was thinking about my teammate's son,
[03:06:42] I was thinking about my teammate's wife. And I needed to annihilate this workout right now.
[03:06:47] There's no other option for them, for that kid or for that woman. And it took what was already
[03:06:54] an extraordinarily intense and rigid lifestyle to another level. And you could, I could even feel
[03:07:05] the additional energy surging through me. It was like electric. And now I'm walking into these
[03:07:09] training sessions, it was just that much easier to get up at zero three, it was just that much
[03:07:13] easier to do those extra two, three reps, when everything in my body and my mind is telling me
[03:07:18] to stop. The image of my teammates five year old is what fueled that.
[03:07:22] Five year old is what fueled that to happen. Freaking, I guess we get some of that beat into
[03:07:32] us, you know, like you do, you just never want to let down your friends. And then you throw the
[03:07:38] family on top of that. Yeah, that's heavy. And you make it back, you make it back to a team,
[03:07:49] you end up going back to Afghanistan. And it's August to fight and season taught.
[03:07:58] What do you think when you show up there, man? There was a, you know, there was a, there was a
[03:08:02] quick, you know, celebration that I had just with myself. The boy collectively, we were,
[03:08:08] it was all business, but I did have that, that glorifying moment that I dreamed of
[03:08:12] taking the steps off the plane. That was real short lived because I realized how fast
[03:08:17] we were in the game and how many gaps I had. So we landed, this is 2015, we landed C17 lands,
[03:08:30] it's taxing, it stops. The tailgate hasn't even dropped yet. And the SOTIF command team is running
[03:08:38] onto the plane, which is unusual. And they run over to our team leadership and they have a little
[03:08:44] huddle on the plane. So we're all looking around. We had a horrible infill. I mean, we went through
[03:08:49] like five different countries, delays and flights. It was a mess. It took us like a week to get in.
[03:08:54] So we're all operating on random time zone times coming off of ambient, you know, half a sleep,
[03:09:00] like, okay, we finally made it. And this, this meeting is happening on the plane.
[03:09:06] We get the equipment off and our team leadership is like, we need to go into the,
[03:09:10] into the meeting and briefing room like now, we go in there. And there was a 19th group team.
[03:09:16] So Army Special Forces National Guard team that was operating down in Helmand that had a real bad
[03:09:24] situation going on with their partner force, like we use the term catastrophic loss of rapport
[03:09:29] as being like mission abort, because we worked through partner force, they were right at that
[03:09:33] point where the machine gun barrels were essentially being pointed inwards with the
[03:09:38] commando elements they were working with. It was, it was, it was horrible. So we needed to get spun
[03:09:44] up. Even though on that trip, we weren't falling directly under the sodiff. We were falling under
[03:09:50] a separate task force for that deployment. Task force gave us over to the sodiff to be the answer
[03:09:57] to this problem as like a temporary solution. So we were getting spun up the second we literally
[03:10:03] the second we landed and it was, it was game time. So did you guys go take over for them?
[03:10:11] We didn't take over, but we went down there and assisted them to get the situation under control
[03:10:19] for a couple of weeks. When you look at that from a leadership perspective, what was wrong?
[03:10:26] I'm going to piss off a lot of national God guys on this, but this is my opinion is
[03:10:30] national God SF teams provide an enormous value across the operational continuum,
[03:10:37] where I've seen it work. The best is when they take national God SF guys and they attach them to
[03:10:43] active duty ODAs. In 2012-13, we had a national God medic that was attached to us for that duration
[03:10:50] of that deployment. That always works out great. When you have an, an organic national God ODA
[03:10:58] and you put them into a combat environment, this is, I'm generally speaking, they just don't
[03:11:04] have the time that they train together to the same level that we do as in the active side
[03:11:11] to bring that same level of tactical capability to a fight. And they're hamstrung oftentimes
[03:11:17] because they group these teams together kind of as of a hodgepodge of different dudes in the unit
[03:11:24] to send them over. So you don't have that organic chemistry that you have with an active duty side.
[03:11:32] So from just a management and operational perspective, they're fighting upstream because
[03:11:37] of that dynamic. And when you put them into a hostile environment, like in Helmand, and you're
[03:11:43] given that type of mission, it can be, it can be really tough. It can be hard for anybody. And if
[03:11:50] you haven't done a good work up together, it's going to be even harder. Yeah. You also, you know,
[03:11:58] you get over there and there's like new challenges for you. One of them you talk about is getting in
[03:12:03] and out of an MRAP. And you go through this whole thing, you're like, if you don't know what an MRAP
[03:12:08] is, it's a, it's a mind resistant vehicle, but they're freaking tall because they want them off
[03:12:12] the ground as high as they can be so that the, the explosion, if it's underneath it, dissipates.
[03:12:18] So they're, they're, you're climbing a ladder to get in there. You say, I can recall one of the
[03:12:22] most frustrating tax was getting into and out of a mind resistant ambush protected all terrain vehicle.
[03:12:28] To get in and out of these trucks, one must climb up four feet with the use of a couple
[03:12:32] metal steps. As with most military vehicles, the MATV is designed for function, not comfort or
[03:12:37] accessibility. Of course, getting into and out of one of these was simple as a two legged dude.
[03:12:42] But in 2015, it was anything but to say this was frustrating would have been an understatement.
[03:12:47] This was also something I did not even consider during my train up to get back onto a team,
[03:12:51] but it was a challenge nonetheless. I began drilling over and over again, in and out,
[03:12:56] trying different foot placements, trying different hand placements, how I shifted my weight.
[03:13:00] Then I did the same with kid on then with a rifle over and over and over again. I had a teammate
[03:13:06] videotape my reps so I could watch the tape and check for deficiencies or wasted movement.
[03:13:11] I had put the, I had them put me on a stopwatch over and over. I checked my time against one of
[03:13:15] my teammates to compare. I focused solely on the task at hand. I wasn't thinking about all the other
[03:13:20] tasks I needed to master and I certainly wasn't thinking about the bridge, just this one piece
[03:13:26] of the puzzle, focus rep after rep until I felt I was sufficient. I repeated this process throughout
[03:13:32] the entire deployment, even after I displayed enough capability to my leadership where they felt
[03:13:37] confident, confident putting me on more and more operations. That's like one little thing,
[03:13:42] which no one would think about and it's a freaking challenge for you and you had to figure how to
[03:13:48] do it. Yeah, because by the time I got to the team, man, they were already past their collective
[03:13:53] training phase. They'd already finished PMT. They were basically just getting gear prep,
[03:13:57] taking some leave and then heading into the box. So I had just like six weeks on the team before
[03:14:03] we were back in Afghanistan. So these tactical tasks, you know, they would have been fleshed
[03:14:07] out and trained in if I was with the guys leading up. I didn't have that time. So things
[03:14:12] became real on the ground the first time I tried to climb into a mad V or an MRAP and I'm like,
[03:14:17] how the hell do I even do this? So that's just an example and it's a list of tasks that I perform
[03:14:25] the same way and I, you know, downtime in between training and ops, I would just identify one of
[03:14:31] these things that I knew needed work and I would just like go crazy and just do it a thousand times.
[03:14:36] If I do this a thousand times, I'm going to figure out how to do it. If I do it a thousand times,
[03:14:41] I'm going to find a way to do it. I just need to do it a thousand times. So like, how do I do that?
[03:14:44] I'll do it a hundred times a day, you know, for a hundred days or whatever, 10 days. And what was
[03:14:49] your, what was your mission on this deployment? What were you guys doing? So we were running the
[03:14:53] Kotejas, which is an Afghan commando unit. That's their tier one unit that was established by CAG
[03:15:02] years prior that they handed off to us to run. So that's their premier direct action CT force.
[03:15:10] So we were running those guys based primarily up out of the Kabul area, not Kabul,
[03:15:17] Propa, but in that vicinity. So we had, we moved around the, basically the entire AO.
[03:15:23] And just running DA's mostly? Yeah. What was your op tempo like?
[03:15:28] It wasn't as busy as, as the deployment I had prior because they were just more specific point
[03:15:35] target rates based on higher levels of Intel and higher levels of effects. Whereas on the
[03:15:40] ground prior, we were just like going out and like paving the road a lot of the way. So this was
[03:15:44] more tied to like strategic initiatives and directions. So we'd maybe have a thing maybe once
[03:15:51] a week, once every couple of weeks. But in that time, there were a couple of massive ops that we
[03:15:56] were a part of that took up good chunks of time. One of that was, was when Kendoos, the Taliban
[03:16:04] took it over. We were a part of that as well. So we ended up shifting to that AO and we dedicated
[03:16:12] like two, three months to the response to that and then to the rebuild of that AO.
[03:16:18] How many guys were in that force you were working with?
[03:16:22] We had around a company size element, about a hundred, 110 dudes. And the craziest thing about
[03:16:28] working with these guys. So these guys were built, you know, by by Kegi as prior, they had all,
[03:16:33] like all the equipment, they had all the Gucci stuff, same uniforms. They're rocking PBS 31s.
[03:16:39] Like they got like high speed stuff and they're all juiced up. Like they're like,
[03:16:45] they're pumping like sustenance in there like daily, which you see that right when you meet these
[03:16:51] guys. That's like very strange. It is. Even like the standard Afghan commandos, they aren't that
[03:16:56] outfitted that way. They don't look that way. We meet up with these dudes for the first time and
[03:17:00] they're these just yoked up Afghans rocking cry precision. Like this is weird, but what made it,
[03:17:08] I never got to a point where I was comfortable, was under nods. Everyone looks the exact same.
[03:17:15] Whereas normally I can tell the difference between my teammate and our partner force
[03:17:19] instantaneously. When you got guys that size rocking the same gear we are, I couldn't tell who
[03:17:25] was who. Dang. So we, you know, we had different like mockings that we used as like IR mockings
[03:17:30] to try to help us figure out where we were. But I was constantly uncomfortable when we were doing
[03:17:36] night stuff, which was a good portion of it because I didn't know who was who. Yeah, that's
[03:17:41] not feeling good. No man. I didn't, I didn't like how were they? They were good in the field. They
[03:17:46] were good. Yeah, they were good. They were good. I mean, you know, it's an Afghan partner force,
[03:17:50] but they were, they were the most proficient that I'd ever seen. No, they were good. And so that,
[03:17:55] that deployment pretty straightforward doing a bunch of DA's. Any, any big lessons learned from
[03:18:02] that one? I mean, I was drinking through a fire hose because not only were my Afghanistan for
[03:18:08] the first time as an amputee, I'm dealing with all these tactical gaps. We were living out of
[03:18:13] rucksacks most of that trip. So I didn't get a chance to really establish like a rhythm in one
[03:18:19] location at one time because we were moving around so much. So I had to adapt my loadout package
[03:18:26] for vehicles for half infill ops for dismounted ops, like where do I keep my extra legs? Where do
[03:18:32] I keep all my equipment? How do I carry all this stuff that I'm going to need if and when something
[03:18:37] breaks down? It was a forcing function to think about how I would go about doing that. So for every
[03:18:46] deployment I've had since, it's pales in comparison because I jumped off like the massive cliff to
[03:18:54] begin with. So now if I go someplace and I'm working out of the same location, it's like
[03:18:59] quite simple comparably. Why do you gotta bring an extra leg? Like what scenario? Are you bringing
[03:19:04] an extra leg in the field? All the time. At least one. I mean, the technology in this thing is great,
[03:19:10] but it breaks. Like legs, legs break. You know, this thing's got a little microprocessor in it.
[03:19:16] You got batteries? It's got an internal battery. Yeah. There's a little computer inside this knee,
[03:19:21] so I have to charge it and then it runs like a computer. It doesn't power me. How long does
[03:19:26] the charge last for? It depends on the level of activity because it goes into like a hibernation
[03:19:30] mode, like a computer. Like right now it's like sleeping. So depending on how much I'm moving
[03:19:35] will determine how much battery life I have, but even on an active schedule, a fully charged knee
[03:19:41] will get me like three days. Okay. And so you're bringing a whole extra leg in the field? At least
[03:19:47] one. Yeah. Sometimes more than one? Yeah. So I'd usually carry one mechanical backup knee on my
[03:19:54] person in my rock and then I'd have a backup one of these. How much is that way? The mechanical ones
[03:19:59] are a lot lighter because there's no technology built into it. Mechanical knee maybe, you know,
[03:20:05] eight pounds, nine pounds. This one weighs closer than that. Freaking nine pounds is a lot when
[03:20:09] you're humping around, bro. That's not fun. No, I'd rather not have to carry it, but I've broken
[03:20:17] so many of these things that it's really, I consider a requirement. So my standard loadout
[03:20:22] for like a vehicle type movement, a gaff would be mechanical leg in my ruck, an extra one of these
[03:20:29] that I'm wearing now in my truck and an extra one of these in another truck. Okay. So my truck was
[03:20:34] disabled or blown up. I'd have another leg somewhere to go get and put on. You know, it kind of sounds
[03:20:41] like a pain in the ass, but it's also like, Hey, if you got shot and you're freaking prosthetic,
[03:20:47] you're like, cool, let me just put on the other one. Well, it's fun. You mentioned one of the
[03:20:51] conversations I had with my group command team. They were voicing their concerns. They're like,
[03:20:56] well, what happens if your prosthetic breaks in the field? And I said, well, I have, I can carry
[03:21:01] an extra one. If your leg breaks in the field, you're out. And they kind of got a chuckle out of
[03:21:06] that. But that's true. So you got good, you got proficient and have a good solid deployment.
[03:21:15] Yeah, successful. And we had a lot of visibility on us that whole trip. I mean, all the way up to
[03:21:20] like Washington, because I needed approval from the use of SOC commander to be able to go.
[03:21:26] So the SOCOM commander was aware of it. So no SF team, no soft team wants a lot of people
[03:21:33] checking it, checking in on them and paying attention to what they're doing and answering
[03:21:38] phone calls from, you know, three style generals, no ODA or team leadership wants that. My team
[03:21:45] leadership dealt with a bunch of that because it was almost like people were expecting and waiting
[03:21:50] for something to go wrong for them to pull me out and be like, Hey, we tried it. It didn't work.
[03:21:54] Let's like get back to reality here. And like, let's find a real solution for this dude.
[03:22:01] But that didn't happen. We had a successful trip. No, no issues. So it was just, it was just hectic
[03:22:08] because I was doing this vehicle type thing in all my free time. So after that six month pump,
[03:22:14] I was the most tired I've ever been in my life.
[03:22:18] What's the, I know you wrote about how there's like a limit to the amount of time you can spend
[03:22:23] on it. Well, how long can you patrol for? Like a foot patrol? So I've done, you know, multi-day
[03:22:29] missions. It just, you know, it does start to take its toll after a while because there'll
[03:22:35] be a point where I have to take it off at a minimum, you know, wipe down the sweat, maybe throw on
[03:22:40] some antiperspirant type stuff, get it back on and go. So it just depends on those different
[03:22:48] variables. But there were times when, you know, I'd be in the field out on something for four, five days.
[03:22:53] And as long as I had, you know, a couple, two, three hours during my rest cycle,
[03:22:57] to kind of let that fluid go back into the residual limb and kind of plump back up,
[03:23:02] strap it back on and, and then be good. Yeah. Well, being in the field for a few days, it's freaking
[03:23:07] legit. That's awesome. Did you come home from that deployment and what, but go again? That's the deal?
[03:23:15] Yeah, back from that trip. Standard training cycle for us, individual schools, collective training
[03:23:21] into PMT. And then the next year, the year after that trip, we were over in Somalia
[03:23:27] on our next thing, which was a CT mission as well, CTDA mission, just different continent,
[03:23:34] but very, very similar. Doing the same thing. Doing the same thing. Did you have a partner
[03:23:38] force over there? Yeah, we had five. Oh, damn. Yeah. We had a bunch of Somalis. We had some Kenyans.
[03:23:45] We had some Ethiopians. And you're training them and you're going out, did they're doing work?
[03:23:50] You're doing work with them? Yeah. We were, we were, we were targeting Al Shabaab. This is a,
[03:23:56] you know, Al Qaeda affiliate. We were targeting those guys. And it's good op tempo. It was busy.
[03:24:04] We were going out once two, three times a week. We were doing DAs. Yep. Doing DA.
[03:24:14] We were down south. The other unit we were working with was, was further up north. And we
[03:24:20] would just like flip flop to support each other. It was busy. And are you, do you get in a flow now?
[03:24:29] You said like, Hey, once you did that first deployment to Afghanistan, where you're living
[03:24:31] out of a rock, are you in a pretty good flow now where you're, you're starting to be able to deal
[03:24:36] with your leg? It's not that big of a factor. Yeah. So the two years I had, like since Walter Reed,
[03:24:42] you know, the first trip to Afghanistan or the train up Afghanistan, now I'm like two,
[03:24:46] two and a half years post injury. I learned a lot of lessons and ways to maintain my prosthetic and
[03:24:53] my body. So I'm learning how to do this. So by the time 2016 trip came around,
[03:24:58] I was, I was much more confident in my tactical prowess and insertion within operations. Hell yeah.
[03:25:06] And then what's after that Somalia deployment? Another deployment? That was 2016. So I came back
[03:25:14] from that. And that was when I transferred groups from third group to fifth group. The reason I
[03:25:21] transferred because my wife, she went down a different career path and got orders for, for
[03:25:28] Campbell. So I transferred groups at this point we were married. So to stay with her, obviously,
[03:25:34] I transferred from third to fifth, went over there and then got integrated with those guys.
[03:25:39] And then my next trip was into Lebanon. Check. And you're obviously still active duty right now.
[03:25:46] What kind of let that one, we use our imaginations for that deployment over there.
[03:25:53] At what point did you decide you were going to try and get a commission, become a warrant?
[03:25:58] Or what you guys call in the army a chief? Yeah. Yeah. In the Navy. I'm sure you know this. Yeah.
[03:26:02] A chief isn't a listed guy in the Navy. And we still have warrant officer. We have chief warrant
[03:26:07] officers. But what point did you want to become a warrant officer? Yeah, I started looking at it
[03:26:11] actually when I was in Somalia, because I warrant had to go home on emergency leave. And I kind of
[03:26:17] took up a lot of those tasks for the detachment. When I got back from, from Lebanon is when I dropped
[03:26:25] that, is when I dropped that packet and got picked up. Yep. So we, the SF warrant offices,
[03:26:33] we go to Fort Bragg to go to our school, whereas every other Army warrant officer goes down to
[03:26:38] Fort Rucka and goes through the warrant officer course. We have our own, our own program because
[03:26:43] it's the SF warrant officer is wildly different than all the other warrant officer branches.
[03:26:50] You know, there's only two combat warrant officers. And those are aviators and then SF guys,
[03:26:56] the rest, those are, those are managers. Like they, you run a desk, right? Because you're,
[03:27:01] you're an expert in that particular system and your job is to manage and task. On the outside
[03:27:05] of the house, it's, it's different because you're on the team. So we have our own school. So I went
[03:27:09] and did that. That was in 2019. Yeah, five months, my five month course, it's a lot of writing and
[03:27:16] briefing and officer and stuff. And you loved every second.
[03:27:20] Dude, salute to the Army and the special operations for this whole thing. Just for them,
[03:27:27] keeping you on that path, opening those things up, you become a warrant officer, like that's freaking
[03:27:32] just outstanding that they, that this happened. You know, I mean, look, this stuff could be easily
[03:27:37] be shut down. Like there could be some, some senior officer that's like, I don't think this is the
[03:27:41] right thing to do. And boom, you know, so that's outstanding that you actually, that the army
[03:27:47] allowed this to happen. Do I believe it should? Hell yeah, of course. But I'm saying, man, you know,
[03:27:53] some of these, some of these bureaucrats, like they don't think that way. They don't think like
[03:27:57] you think they don't think like I think so salute to the army and to SF for, for keeping that door
[03:28:04] open. Freakin that's just outstanding. I know I had one of my guys was Ryan Job was blind,
[03:28:10] he's blinded. And you know, I talked to the admiral and I was like, Hey, sir, he, he wants to stay in
[03:28:17] and the animals like whatever he wants, wants to stand. We got jobs for him. That's freaking
[03:28:22] outstanding. You get picked up from warrant and then what's the next step? Next step is going to
[03:28:30] my next attachment as the assistant attachment commander. And I was notified the team I was
[03:28:36] going to go to about two weeks left of the war officer course. And the second I was told the
[03:28:42] team number, I knew the type of team it was going to be, which was a maritime ops team, a dive team.
[03:28:47] Yeah. Right. And SF all the teams that ended the number five, their dive teams.
[03:28:53] All right, just completed the war officer course. First amputee to ever go is challenging as hell.
[03:29:00] Believe it or not, it's, you know, there's a lot of physical stuff. But to go back a bit,
[03:29:04] when I first got to group, the war officer on the teams, stereotypically, we're out of shape,
[03:29:10] old guys that were never around. Well, the regiment realized that and they completely
[03:29:15] re altered the actual course to include a lot of physical gates that you had to pass. Because
[03:29:21] they didn't want these old crusty guy out of shape guys on teams anymore. If you're going to be a
[03:29:24] war officer on a team, you need to be able to function as a team guy. And every ODA has the
[03:29:28] assistant commander is a warrant. Is that right? Every ODA doesn't have a warrant. But because
[03:29:35] it's a small community, most do and that guy is the assistant attachment commander. Because the
[03:29:40] SF ODA, the 12 man construct is designed to run split team ops. It's not just rug a random number.
[03:29:46] So the captain takes one section and the warrant takes the other. If there's no warrant, who takes
[03:29:51] the other one? The the sergeant? The would would be the team sergeant. The team sergeant. Yeah,
[03:29:56] the senior enlisted guy. Where does the captain get his experience before he's the captain of an ODA
[03:30:01] team? Is he coming from infantry? Is that where he gets his initial experience as a leader, like
[03:30:05] as a platoon commander or something? Yeah, most come from the infantry. They don't necessarily have
[03:30:10] to have an infantry background. But they're I mean, they're green, even like the most experienced
[03:30:15] new captain. In today's world, you're not seeing it that much because there's not a lot of combat,
[03:30:21] but they get maybe one trip as a platoon leader in their conventional unit, go to the captain's
[03:30:27] career course, go to the Q course and then show up. And that level of inexperience is why the SF
[03:30:34] warrant officer exists, because their trajectory, they get two years on a team and then they're gone. So
[03:30:40] the most senior captain on a team has been there for 24 months. Like that guy just barely figured
[03:30:46] out his job, what an ODA does, how we fit within the overall picture. And then he's on to the next
[03:30:52] thing. The warrant is there, you know, we're expected to do five, six years on the same
[03:30:56] detachment, where there to be that strategic advisor to that leader. That's freaking legit.
[03:31:01] So you get to dive team assignment or sorry, I cut you off. So you were saying that warrant
[03:31:08] officer school was actually there were some there were some challenges in warrant officer school,
[03:31:11] wasn't a walk in the park. No, no, it was it was legit. It was tough. So I mean, I got like two
[03:31:17] weeks left before I'm going to graduate. I'm just about the top of this ridgeline, like graduation
[03:31:21] is inevitable at this point. So I'm feeling pretty happy about my, you know, my performance and where
[03:31:25] I'm going, I'm excited. And then I get the phone call, like you're going to this team right here.
[03:31:29] Yeah. And I had the same response that everyone, every SF guy gets when he's totally going with
[03:31:35] dive team, which is shit. Okay. Because everyone knows CDQC, the combat dive of qualification
[03:31:44] course, everyone knows that that is the hottest school within the army by a mile, physically
[03:31:51] and mentally. And most fearful of it, most don't want to go down that road. You know,
[03:31:57] I had the same response. It was, okay, well, my celebration here was short lived because now
[03:32:03] I got to figure out how I'm going to do this. Yeah, that sounds like, like I was giving all
[03:32:10] these props to the army. I guess we got to give more prop. They're like, cool. Oh, you want to
[03:32:13] be warrant? Cool. Oh, you got one leg house dive school sound. Yeah. And it's, I mean, it's funny
[03:32:19] man because I got back to the group. I got to my new battalion and got assigned to my new team.
[03:32:23] And I met with the company command team the next day. And within the first couple minutes of that
[03:32:28] conversation, they told me that no one had any expectations of me going to dive school. Oh,
[03:32:35] I had the same conversation with the battalion command team a couple days later and was told the
[03:32:39] same thing from them, which I found was interesting, you know, and I looked at them kind of sideways.
[03:32:45] And I said, listen, this team is there a bunch of aggressive savages to see. It's the most senior
[03:32:50] team we have in the battalion. They're hungry for combat. They haven't seen it yet. We need a
[03:32:57] strong leader on that team. There are only two warrant officer candidates. There were only two
[03:33:01] of us in fifth group that went me and my buddy, me and my buddy Mike had wildly different experiences.
[03:33:10] Mike did a lot of like interagency stuff and he was more on the technical side of things and did
[03:33:14] a lot of intel stuff. My experience was like all combat. So they looked at both of our packets
[03:33:19] and they're like, we can't send this guy to a dive team, especially this one. It's going to have to
[03:33:23] be Nick, but it'll work because he's a strong leader. They'll respect them. It'll help keep things
[03:33:28] moving in a general direction. Dive teams are known for being insubordinate, aggressive, you
[03:33:37] know, it's the double edged sword for leadership because you got a really high performing
[03:33:43] detachment, but you're going to have to deal with their aggressiveness and keeping them
[03:33:48] within line in a garrison environment. So they made it clear to me that that was the reason why I
[03:33:53] was going. And yet they didn't expect you to be actually going through dive school. Like that
[03:33:57] wouldn't be a requirement necessarily is what they're thinking. And there as that's what they
[03:34:02] were thinking. I didn't see it that way. Yeah, you're just like, okay, well, I got to go do dive school.
[03:34:08] It's the one thing that separates dive teams from every other detachment is going through
[03:34:14] that extra filter. And it's really irrelevant to the actual execution of maritime ops. It's just
[03:34:20] that fine filter to be able to push yourself through that hell. And then you take 12 guys that
[03:34:26] have all been through that and lump them together, they are going to be a high performing
[03:34:29] detachment no matter the mission. Were you in the water much growing up? A little bit, but not much
[03:34:36] of a group in New England, you know, so yeah, I mean, spent time in the water, but I wasn't a swimmer.
[03:34:41] But okay, you know, never scoop a dive before nothing. So this is not going to be fun. No,
[03:34:49] yeah, it's not going to be fun at all. You got to start training for it, right? Like you got to
[03:34:55] start figuring out like getting comfortable in the water is a big deal. Do they normally pick guys
[03:35:00] that were have some comfort in the water? Or do guys volunteer for does anyone volunteer for it?
[03:35:05] Some do it's rare for a new a new dude to show and be like put me on a dive team. Most happy with
[03:35:10] the little green hat in the head and they want to just like chill and just get to team stuff.
[03:35:15] It does happen. It's not very often that it happens. I think the Sgt's major, they do ask if
[03:35:21] there's an open slot on a dive team, hey, you know, you've come from a water, do you spend any time
[03:35:24] swimming? You know, which I think brings value to your success and CDQC is more about your being
[03:35:32] comfortable in the water, not necessarily your ability as a freestyle swimmer. Oh yeah, it's
[03:35:38] definitely a comfort in the water. I mean, I haven't been through that school, but in in basic
[03:35:42] seal training, you go through some pretty significant dive challenges and people it pays to be comfortable
[03:35:48] in the water. You have to be. Yeah. So I do think they have that conversation. But if the answers
[03:35:53] know and they needed another diver, it's like, okay, well, you're going anyway. And you had to fight
[03:35:58] against a med board again, just kind of like get a waiver to go to this school. Yeah, it wasn't a
[03:36:04] med board, but I did need a waiver approved to be able to go because of my physical profile.
[03:36:09] So there had never been an amputee to even like consider going. And now I'm kind of back where
[03:36:16] I was where I had to fight the admin fight and then also prepare myself physically and mentally.
[03:36:21] So the admin side, it worked out great for me because I went through my dive physical, which is
[03:36:26] the most in depth physical we have in the army, they check you for everything because it's just
[03:36:30] just such a high stress school. There's two phases I get through both of those both are clean, both
[03:36:35] are good to go. And then our med clinic sends up the waiver for me to be able to attend administratively.
[03:36:42] Well, that needs to be approved by the SWCC surgeon, who's a full bird colonel. I said, okay,
[03:36:47] cool, send it. I get a phone call about a week later from some 910 area code number, which is
[03:36:54] North Carolina, answer the phone. And there's just some dude on the other end of the phone like yelling.
[03:36:58] And he's talking about one legged guy who wants to go to dive school. And I think that someone had
[03:37:05] just dialed my phone number by accident. And I'm over here in a conversation about me. And I'm going,
[03:37:10] Hello, who is this? Dude's just yelling, talking real aggressively talking real fast. Finally,
[03:37:15] he stops. I'm like, who is this? He's like, Nick, it's it's Mike. And I said, Doc, how you doing?
[03:37:24] Well, Mike was the third group surgeon back when I was in Afghanistan. He was the first guy that
[03:37:31] operated on me when I've got flown into Bagram. He had since been promoted to 06 and was working
[03:37:37] as the SWCC surgeon. So he and I knew each other real well. I didn't know that that's where his job
[03:37:42] was till he calls me. And I'm like, Oh, no kidding. Okay. He's like, I'm staring at your, your waiver
[03:37:49] to the front of me right now. I said, you're going to approve it? He's like, Yeah, I already did.
[03:37:52] I just sent it back. He's like, I think you add to your mind that you want to go do this. But
[03:37:58] if you want to go, go ahead, like good luck. So, you know, ironic turn of events, if it was anybody
[03:38:05] other than him, who knows if that would have been approved, because you are assuming quite a bit of
[03:38:10] risk, both for him as the medical professional and then the commander in which he works underneath,
[03:38:15] like they're assuming that risk to send you a course like that as a student. He gave me the
[03:38:21] green light. And then once I had that, I had already been training, you know, physically my first day
[03:38:26] on the team. I was in the pool. Day one, I just met these guys. It's my first day in this battalion.
[03:38:32] It's my first day as a warrant officer. And I'm in the pool. You got to get like, fin legs or
[03:38:38] some shit. Yeah. So I did, you know, and I went to my prosthetist and I said, I need a fin.
[03:38:43] And they make, you know, fins for amputees. It's not, it's not like a new thing. He gave me this one.
[03:38:51] And things may be, I don't know, three feet in length. It's small. And my teammates called it
[03:38:57] my finding Nemo fin. It's just the difference between my leg and this thing was just so different.
[03:39:02] But the concern was that, you know, if it's, if it's a longer lever, it places more force through
[03:39:08] the socket, what's actually attaching to my body. So we were concerned that if it was too long, I
[03:39:14] was generating too much force, it would rip the prosthetic off my body. So we went with the more
[03:39:18] secured option, even though it gave me less propulsion. So that was what I had. And, you know,
[03:39:25] I just said, you know, Roger, that this is my equipment, I'm just going to figure out how to
[03:39:27] make it work. Really had to turn my left leg into just an absolute tank, because that's what was
[03:39:33] propelling me for treading and for underwater nav and for all the finning was my left leg.
[03:39:38] That's what I used in the pool during our train up. And, you know, my teammates were phenomenal.
[03:39:44] But at the same time, it was no one really knew how to do this with a guy with one leg. So it
[03:39:50] was a lot of trial and error and like figuring it out. Did that. And then I was in communication
[03:39:57] with the leadership down at CDQC. They reached out to me once they were made aware that an amputee
[03:40:02] was going to come down. It was a third group dude who was actually one of my instructors in the Q
[03:40:07] course was now the Sergeant Major down there. So he hit me up and was like, Hey, man, just like,
[03:40:12] keep me updated with if you're modifying any specific procedure, I just need to know what
[03:40:18] that is. Because my instructors don't like know what this looks like. You know, so you know, like,
[03:40:24] maritime ops, and especially in the schoolhouse, it's very procedural, like left foot here, right
[03:40:28] foot here, it's broken down step by step by step to increase efficiency and reduce risk to keep it
[03:40:34] as safe as possible. Well, for me, some of those steps just don't exist. If it's like,
[03:40:39] put your right foot here, well, like I don't have one. So what am I doing when everyone else is
[03:40:43] putting that right foot over there? So just those small little tweaks is what my team and I were
[03:40:48] kind of playing around with. And then I messaged that to the cadre down there, it was ultimately
[03:40:53] up to them to decide if what I was doing would meet their standard requirements.
[03:41:00] Couple adaptations with a couple different things. But and then the CDQC journey.
[03:41:05] What's the attrition rate at that school? It varies from 20% up to like 60%. There are some
[03:41:15] classes that graduate like five guys. And if you just if you fail, they just send you back to SF,
[03:41:20] you just can't be on a dive team type thing. You usually will get two or three attempts at it,
[03:41:27] which is quite common. If you're afraid to take a guy maybe twice, how long is the school? Six
[03:41:32] weeks. You got a section in here. You talk a little bit about this, which I had a lot of
[03:41:40] Julian laughter when I was reading it. The combat diver qualification course or dive school has
[03:41:48] several tests students must successfully complete. Each is designed with a purpose according to
[03:41:52] years of data collection and lessons learned from generations of previous combat divers.
[03:41:56] The most notorious is the one man competency exam. During this test, students are required to wear a
[03:42:02] blacked out mask to simulate nighttime conditions and then surge underwater for several currents.
[03:42:09] Once the surge phase is complete, the students are placed at the bottom of the pool and paired up
[03:42:13] with an instructor who systematically removes the students air source regulator and in places a
[03:42:19] series of deficiencies. So how do I breathe without a regulator? You don't you hold your breath.
[03:42:25] The student is required to trace the air source line from its origination point to the regulator
[03:42:30] while on a breath hold in order to retrieve the air source and breathe. This process is repeated
[03:42:36] until the exam is completed. If this sounds awful, it is because it is just that awful. The one man
[03:42:42] competency exam is widely considered the most difficult test within dive school and is the
[03:42:47] reason why so many do not advance in the course. There is however a method to this madness.
[03:42:52] Conducting underwater operations is arguably the most dangerous task we do within the military.
[03:42:58] The ocean is unforgiving. A plethora of things can go wrong and as with most operations something
[03:43:03] will almost certainly will go wrong. Given the fact that we as humans require oxygen above all
[03:43:09] else to live problems underwater can quickly turn deadly. During underwater operations it is just
[03:43:14] you and your team at times perhaps it is just you and your dive buddy and if things really go bad
[03:43:19] it's just you. When a problem presents itself you absolutely must be able to correct it and
[03:43:24] depending on the severity of the issue time becomes a critical factor every second counts
[03:43:29] pressures at an all-time high. The stress of these situations can be incapacitating. The only way
[03:43:35] to work through the situation is to remain calm. Good times. We have a test like that similar
[03:43:43] that's called pool competency. It's the same thing they're just going to freaking jack you up underwater.
[03:43:49] It's not fun. That's not fun. You got to fight the demons. Every survival instinct you have as humans
[03:43:56] you got to battle through that. But you made it through. You made it through that dive things.
[03:44:06] You failed a couple times. I failed one man twice. How many chances do you get? Three.
[03:44:13] Yes. I blacked out underwater my first two go-arounds and my blackout experience they tell you
[03:44:21] you know you're going to start to feel yourself going like when you're being choked out. I like
[03:44:25] things get soft and start to feel yourself getting comfortable like you're on the verge of blacking
[03:44:30] out. That doesn't happen with me. Mine is just continued increase in pain and discomfort and then
[03:44:38] you're out and then I come to and I'm on the pool deck. What kind are you using a
[03:44:43] normal regulator like the kind with one hose that you press a button and air comes out of it?
[03:44:49] Yeah. You use an open water tank on your back with the standard regulator. We have this in
[03:44:57] seal training. They have this regulator from like 1968 or something and it's got two hoses. One's an
[03:45:06] inhalation hose and one's an exhalation hose and it looks like you know if you look at Jacques
[03:45:10] Cousteau diving in 1973 like that's what he's using and there's no button to press.
[03:45:17] You have to drink the water out. You just suck the water out of it when you put it back in your
[03:45:22] mouth and they just take this thing and freak it out. It's insane. The only reason that this
[03:45:26] regulator exists is for buds at this point. They still use this. They still use it. Wow.
[03:45:31] They still use it to this day. It's crazy. It's crazy evolution. Yeah but I've talked to some of
[03:45:39] the people that work at that company and they were like yeah that's the only people we make
[03:45:44] for. I guess there's an occasional person that were requested if they're an underwater photographer
[03:45:48] because the bubbles are behind your back but other than that it's just these because there's no
[03:45:53] reason to use it. It's the worst piece of equipment ever for diving. They probably made it and like
[03:45:59] a year later like hey this is dumb. Fix it but that's what we still use. Not fun. All right so you
[03:46:08] get done. You pass. Now you're a one officer inside of your ODA team. Rack up another deployment. Where
[03:46:14] are you going this one? The one after that we were in Iraq. Damn okay. Doing a lot of diving
[03:46:22] in Iraq where are you? Not much. What year was that? 21. No kidding. Last year. We went in in
[03:46:29] December of 20. December of 20 into 21. I mean from what you can say without going into classified
[03:46:35] material like what was your general mission? Advise assist. I mean the Iraq of today is much
[03:46:40] different than the Iraq of your days. How'd you like being the number two guy in command?
[03:46:48] I enjoyed it. Yeah we did a couple split team scenarios but then because of what we were doing
[03:46:56] was pretty routine myself and my actual team leader we would just swap out at times so I got
[03:47:03] some reps at the detachment commander thing so it was good. And you liked that being in a leadership
[03:47:08] position? Very much so. It's difficult as a warrant because a way it was described to me was it's a
[03:47:16] commandless, thankless, selfless position. You know when you have that tripod of leadership,
[03:47:22] the detachment commander, the captain, your senior enlisted guy, and then the warrant officer,
[03:47:28] you know the detachment commander is in charge of the team. He runs the team.
[03:47:31] The senior enlisted guy, the team sergeant, he runs the boys. They all work for him. The warrant
[03:47:37] exists kind of in between that and the way you influence as a leader is more done through your
[03:47:42] actions than it is about having one-on-one like molding sessions with the individuals because
[03:47:49] that's really the job of the team sergeant. So your approach to leadership as a warrant
[03:47:54] has to be a mature one which is tough for a lot of us because we're aggressive type A
[03:47:59] pipe hitters who think we know exactly what Wright looks like so I have to stay back from that and
[03:48:05] lead through supporting others and lead through more of your actions than your verbal mentorship.
[03:48:13] It can be tough. And then so where are you at right now? Are you still at a team?
[03:48:19] I just came off the team. And so where are you stationed now? I'm still at four Campbell,
[03:48:24] still in fifth group. I just took over as the company operations warrant for our advanced
[03:48:30] skills company. So when I was working in the combatives committee it was underneath the advanced
[03:48:35] skills company. So now amongst the company level leadership where I work alongside a major
[03:48:41] and a sergeant major. Got it. You know that kind of brings us up to date for this,
[03:48:48] for where you're at right? What you got going on. You know that this is the thing though about this
[03:48:55] book is this book, this book objective secure, it's not a memoir of your life. It's not like hey,
[03:49:04] here's a bunch of stories. It's actually like almost like a field manual of how you can overcome
[03:49:15] things and how you can achieve things in life, which is a pretty awesome book. And look, obviously
[03:49:23] I read some of the stories out of it today because you relate oh this event happened. Here's you know
[03:49:28] what occurred. Here's what caused me to do this. Here's where I learned this lesson. There's a lot
[03:49:32] of that stuff in there. But the actual book is I mean the subtitle of the book is battle tested
[03:49:38] guide to goal achievement, right? Which is freaking legit. Like hey, here's a guy that has gone through
[03:49:47] a bunch of obstacles and overcome those obstacles. And he did it not by luck, not by miracles, but by
[03:49:55] figuring out how to assess these things and how to overcome them. And you take the military
[03:50:01] methodology that you learned from being in special operations and you apply that to your life and
[03:50:05] apply that to the challenge you face and you outline that throughout this book. And that's why if
[03:50:12] you know if you're listening right now just order this book right now because there's so much good
[03:50:16] information in it to help anybody that's overcoming anything. That's facing any obstacles, but I would
[03:50:23] feel bad if I didn't at least give people sort of a heads up sort of some of the highlights that you
[03:50:28] go over in the book. So I just want to crack this thing open and like just like I said just hit some
[03:50:35] of the high points of how you live your life, how you overcame these things. The book is called
[03:50:43] objective secure. You start off with objective secure a military brevity term used during the
[03:50:48] execution of combat operations meaning the location or target has been isolated and contained,
[03:50:52] the assault force has eliminated all known threats and the element is prepared to move to the next
[03:50:57] objective phase of the operations of the operation. Reaching objective secure during a combat
[03:51:04] operation is a good feeling. It means we have a foothold, a location to re-consolidate,
[03:51:09] establish communications, prepare stage and if necessary fall back to. But this does not mean
[03:51:14] the mission is complete. Objective secure in our context here is twofold. First it is a victory,
[03:51:22] a milestone, it marks the success of achieving a necessary goal along the route to mission
[03:51:27] accomplishment. Second it is a tool, a system, a methodology, a process designed to manifest
[03:51:34] our reality. Objective secure is a philosophy and a blueprint that was created in real time,
[03:51:40] refined, then retrospectively analyzed following years of trial and error, years of failure,
[03:51:46] years of obstacles and years of adversity. It was forged by fire and is battle tested literally.
[03:51:56] Objective secure. Did you have that name out of the gate for the book? No, not at all. I mean,
[03:52:06] I created this thing. The original objective secure was about a nine page Microsoft Word
[03:52:13] document that I slapped together as the result of being asked the same question hundreds and hundreds
[03:52:21] of times was how did you do what you did? So rather than answering those every single time,
[03:52:28] what you're email address. Yeah, I said, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to answer that
[03:52:32] question, put a little more thought into it and that way I can just attach and send. It was about
[03:52:38] efficiency. I created the original one of these things, a purely out of efficiency to answer
[03:52:41] the question to provide that information to those that were seeking it. It wasn't until years later,
[03:52:47] I used it as such for years. It wasn't until years later that a good buddy of mine, now my
[03:52:53] business partner, hit me up. I was actually still in dive school. I had about a week left and he
[03:52:58] called me out of the blue and said, I think you need to write a book. And I said, get out of here.
[03:53:04] What are you talking about? Dude, I'm clinging by a thread down here. I'm exhausted. I can't even
[03:53:09] have this conversation with you. We eventually circled back a couple of weeks later and I gave
[03:53:13] it some thought. And this is in the middle of 2020 COVID. I got a lot of extra time and energy on my
[03:53:20] hands. Gyms are closed. The combatives house is closed. We're doing this weird half on half off
[03:53:26] work schedule, you know, remote LPD sessions. It was just a strange time. I had a lot of extra
[03:53:31] time and energy that I otherwise wouldn't have had. So out of respect to him, I gave it some thought
[03:53:37] about that Microsoft Word doc. And I said, I actually kind of have something. And he said,
[03:53:43] just keep going with it and see what it turns into. So I sunk my teeth into it and became
[03:53:48] real obsessed with it. I really found out that I actually enjoy writing, which if you had asked me
[03:53:52] that a week before this, I would have said no, no interest, but I actually do enjoy it. But I didn't
[03:53:58] figure out the title until maybe about the halfway point. I started thinking about it.
[03:54:03] And then it kind of kind of flipped. Yeah, you got what you the way you run your life and it
[03:54:11] becomes really clear in the book. I haven't touched on these part of the books yet. But like,
[03:54:14] you're you're very calculating in everything that you do. This is what I need to get done. Here's
[03:54:19] what and that's what makes this so effective. And obviously, it's worth outstanding for you to be
[03:54:25] able to pull off the kind of shit that you've pulled off. That comes across. And one of the things
[03:54:34] that one of the ways that you break down the book is you use some of the well, you use the way you
[03:54:39] learn things in the army. And one of the things that you talk about is the ethos, the warrior ethos.
[03:54:45] And here's part of it. I will always place the mission first. Now I realize the term mission
[03:54:51] has a strong military undertone, but this absolutely applies to everybody because everybody has
[03:54:55] dreams. That's what the mission is. It's a dream, the long term goal. The mission is what is waiting
[03:55:01] at the end of the road. Missions are impactful, often life changing. But for many, the mission
[03:55:05] will remain just that a dream. Many do not reach mission success. Many do not turn the dream into
[03:55:11] a reality. Those who do are able to recognize the need for something. Sacrifice, a subset of
[03:55:19] discipline, something we'll get into later, the active forgoing what we want for what we need.
[03:55:29] So you break these things down. So when we say, I'm fast forwarding. So when we say,
[03:55:35] I will always leave, I will always place the mission first. What we are saying is, I will
[03:55:41] make the necessary sacrifices, and I will prioritize my time. And again, I'm like jump,
[03:55:48] you've got all kinds of applications of this where people read and be like, oh, I think that
[03:55:54] might be me right there. Oh, I think he's talking about me over here. Or Oh, I need to do, I need
[03:55:59] to do better on that thing. So this, this, this book is very practical from that perspective.
[03:56:06] The next section I'll read is I will never accept defeat.
[03:56:11] This statement has a somewhat obvious meaning behind it, resolve, resiliency,
[03:56:16] and toughness. The mentality is that if you get knocked down seven times, you get up eight.
[03:56:24] Pretty, pretty straightforward. I'm going to read one little section out of this.
[03:56:28] Our egos do not digest failure easily. Our egos want us to constantly project strength,
[03:56:34] ability and knowledge. Our egos can prevent us from asking questions and pushing our
[03:56:38] limitations. Humility requires allowing ourselves to become vulnerable, to expose our weaknesses,
[03:56:45] things that are extremely difficult for most and for individuals who work in the special
[03:56:49] operations community, they're next to impossible. Gotta stay humble.
[03:56:57] Can be tough. So when we say I will never accept defeat, what we are saying is strive
[03:57:04] for failure. And when you reach it, learn from it, apply it and keep moving forward.
[03:57:10] Again, a bunch of good examples you throw in here about this. And all totally pragmatic.
[03:57:21] Next one, I will never quit. Initially, this sounds similar to what we just talked about,
[03:57:24] but upon further examination, we'll recognize the difference. I will never quit is about
[03:57:29] avoiding complacency. It is not letting ourselves get comfortable not celebrating too long,
[03:57:34] not accepting status quo and not growing stagnant. It is adopting the principle that satisfaction
[03:57:40] doesn't exist. And that now is the time to attack. Check. These things have a lot more meaning.
[03:57:54] When determining the appropriate rucksack, we need to think about the mission. We need to
[03:58:00] choose the right size rucksack for the job. Choose one too small will not be able to bring the
[03:58:04] necessary equipment. Choose one too large and we tend to fill the extra space with things we want
[03:58:09] rather than only the things we need ounces equal pounds. Next thing you know, we're humping 70 pounds
[03:58:15] instead of 60 pounds. At first, this may go unnoticed. But as the miles continue, the extra 10
[03:58:22] pounds take their toll. This will undoubtedly increase fatigue and reduce focus and ability,
[03:58:28] leaving us less effective when it is time to go to work. And this is what made me want to read
[03:58:33] this same as with ounces, minutes become hours, hours become days, days become weeks. And before
[03:58:41] you know it, a year has passed with little to show for it. Later in the book, you got some of your
[03:58:53] time like you got your daily schedule written out. It's like to the minute. Yeah, there's no time
[03:59:00] being wasted for freaking Nick. Now we're next on the mission, man. When Nick's trying to get back
[03:59:06] to an ODA team, there's not a second wasted. Can't. Can't. I mean, for one, just the gift of perspective
[03:59:20] with coming as close to death as I did, driving in how precious life is and how time is our most
[03:59:28] limited resource and just to maximize the gift of we have of minute to minute to minute, just that
[03:59:35] perspective was given to me through what happened. And then when you've got, you know, big goals,
[03:59:43] that's what it takes. That's what it took for me. Anyway, I think that's actually just what it takes.
[03:59:51] Not just for you, but for anybody. I will never leave a comrade. I will never leave a fallen
[03:59:58] comrade. We know the obvious meaning behind this, the meaning reserved for the warfighter,
[04:00:02] the mentality that no matter what, nobody gets left behind. When we open the aperture a bit,
[04:00:07] however, this tenant is speaking to a commitment to doing whatever it takes. Yeah, there's not too
[04:00:15] many, there's not too many sayings that have the word never in them, right? And that's what this is.
[04:00:21] This is like the commitment. You talk about this in this section when we understand that
[04:00:27] everybody eventually hits a decision point and that when they do most give in our decision
[04:00:33] point becomes an opportunity. Man, we were just talking about this the other day, like your life,
[04:00:38] our lives are just a bunch of decisions. They're just, they're just all decisions. What are you
[04:00:43] going to do? What are you going to eat? What are you going to get up? What are you going to do today?
[04:00:46] What progress do you make? What time are you going to waste? You say it gives us a chance to either
[04:00:51] extend our lead or make up ground on our competition. Through this understanding, we will begin to
[04:00:58] welcome these decision points. We will seek them. We will find ourselves intentionally pushing
[04:01:03] until we find ourselves standing at the crossroads. And when we arrive, when most would find themselves
[04:01:09] conflicted, we are not, we embrace it. So when we say, I will never leave a fallen comrade,
[04:01:15] what we are saying is, I will do whatever it takes to make it. At times, we have to ignore the brain,
[04:01:21] listen to the heart and take the risk. It's weird how many decisions you make without even
[04:01:29] thinking about it, the fact that you have a choice, right? You just, people just allow things to
[04:01:34] happen in their lives. Sure. Oh, that just, you know, what are you doing today? Oh, you know,
[04:01:43] like, no, that's not part of the plan. That's not part of the plan. That's not going to work.
[04:01:48] That's not going to work. Nick knows what he's doing. He knows what he's doing on Sunday afternoon
[04:01:55] at 1340. He knows what's up. And this is where you break down how we're going to execute this.
[04:02:09] So like, you just kind of talked about the mindset through the warrior ethos. Now you get into the
[04:02:13] execution of this whole thing. Phase one is the mission. Here's where we identify the mission.
[04:02:19] And again, how many people are going through life? They don't even have their mission identified.
[04:02:22] I'd say a lot. You know, I've talked about the fact that I was very lucky because when I was very
[04:02:28] young, I joined the Navy and I just wanted to be a good seal. And what like that gives you,
[04:02:35] you can make so many decisions based on that, you can make, you can do so much just on having a goal
[04:02:40] like that. Here's where we identify the mission. This is a long term goal, the dream, the what we
[04:02:48] are trying to accomplish, the who we aspire to become. There's a reason why this is phase one
[04:02:53] is it is exceedingly important. If we botch this up, we may be making progress, but progress in the
[04:03:00] wrong direction. So if you're listening right now, and you don't know what your mission is,
[04:03:07] you're already, you already got a significant problem. You get a problem going on because where
[04:03:11] are you going? Where are you going right now? What is your mission? If you don't have a mission,
[04:03:17] you need to figure out what it is 100%. And yeah, I think that the way that you
[04:03:28] like had that memory freaking woke up from a coma without a leg and we're like cool,
[04:03:33] I'm going back to an ODA team. There's my mission. Like this is what I'm doing.
[04:03:40] Design, we must have a solid understanding of our current situation, our mission, our obstacles,
[04:03:45] and how we are going to advance. This may sound intimidating, but don't let it overwhelm you.
[04:03:49] And then you break out. You know, there's another thing we didn't talk about. We didn't talk about
[04:03:54] the fact that once you didn't have a leg, you're like, all right, I need to be beneficial to my
[04:04:02] team in other ways beyond just physical, you know, you're going to be able to hold this
[04:04:06] standard. And I would say you probably do a lot better than the standard, but you're like, hey,
[04:04:10] there might be some deficiencies that I have because I only have one freaking leg.
[04:04:14] So I'm going to make up for that. And you started going to some of the more cerebral parts of
[04:04:21] special forces started going to schools to learn, you know, operational art and design.
[04:04:28] And that way you had something else to offer. You know, it was like almost like a backup plan.
[04:04:33] If you didn't have it all physically, which again, I would, I would say you definitely have a
[04:04:38] physical, but if you had some slack there, you're going to be able to make up for it.
[04:04:41] Yeah, that was a conscious decision that you made. Yeah, no, that was tough to accept that growing up
[04:04:46] as an athlete and a fighter and, you know, being that door kicker on the team is what my team wanted
[04:04:51] of me. It's what I enjoy doing, spend time in the gym, the fight house on the range. And everybody
[04:04:57] was a win-win accepting the fact that no matter how hard I trained, I was never going to be as
[04:05:03] physically dominant as I was with two legs. How can I make up the difference and still be that asset?
[04:05:10] And this was in the hospital. I was still an inpatient status living in the hospital,
[04:05:13] going through surgeries when this happened. And actually the Ususak commander at the time,
[04:05:17] General Cleveland, he showed up just to visit me. We had a conversation and that's what opened up my
[04:05:23] eyes to the other skills within being an all-encompassing green beret or an effective ODA,
[04:05:31] kind of the soft side of our business. You know, most of us come in because we want to kick
[04:05:35] down doors and shoot bad guys in the face, but there's a lot of other skills and tasks that
[04:05:39] enable that to be able to happen. So I recognized it then and committed to it in my own personal time.
[04:05:49] So rather than reading about exercise physiology or nutrition, I was reading about cultural dynamics
[04:05:54] in Afghanistan. I was enhancing my foreign language skills. I hated doing this stuff, man.
[04:06:00] I absolutely hated it. I loved the way I spent my time with two legs. I didn't want to do this at all,
[04:06:06] but I believed that it would work. I just forced myself to do it, man, which I'm preaching to the
[04:06:16] gospel or I'm preaching to the choir on this is like the discipline to execute on the tasks that
[04:06:23] you know will bring value is the road to success. Doing the thing whether or not you feel like
[04:06:30] doing it or not. And I know you're the subject matter expert on this. I've learned a lot of this
[04:06:35] from you personally during all of the stuff we're talking about. It's like, did the research,
[04:06:40] I know this will work or I'm confident this will work. Yeah, it sucks. But doing the things that
[04:06:46] suck is what separates the average from the great. So diving myself into this road, operational
[04:06:51] design was a school I went to. I needed to waive it ago because I was an E6 and it's reserved for
[04:06:56] more senior leaders who are going to be dealing with like campaign planning and type stuff. But I
[04:07:01] went as a tool to increase my cerebral and intellectual capacity overall. But then I was
[04:07:07] able to leverage what I learned in the course and apply it to my mission. Take the lessons learned
[04:07:14] and actually use those techniques to outline my day-to-day life and my operational approach. So
[04:07:20] it was multifaceted what I was able to leverage by doing that. Yeah, it's almost like what we
[04:07:26] were talking about earlier with leadership and how leadership is a skill. Well, you know,
[04:07:29] planning is a skill and designing courses of action to overcome obstacles. It's not just
[04:07:37] something you're born with. You can actually learn how to do it. And that's what you did. You went
[04:07:41] and learned how to do it. And here you look, you applied it in the field, but here you're applying
[04:07:45] it to your life. You go through this, you go through this phase diagram. You got all these
[04:07:51] diagrams in here, determine your current situation, define the mission, frame the problem, identify
[04:07:58] lines of effort. You go through this whole thing. And then once you figure out what the lines of
[04:08:04] effort are, you talk about how you're going to now attack those lines. You got the next phase,
[04:08:09] which is research. Access to information has never been as readily available as it is today.
[04:08:14] Never. There's absolutely no excuse to be uninformed. I don't know how it's just that
[04:08:19] an excuse and a avoidable reason. We must set ourselves up for success. The key to this phase,
[04:08:23] however, is to move quickly. We cannot get stuck here. The research is solely to get the wheel
[04:08:27] spinning and provide some direction to advance down our lines of effort. And you give examples of this.
[04:08:36] What is it? One of the examples you give is, hey, I'm living in a crappy house. I want to get a new
[04:08:41] house. Here's the things I can do. Here's the problem. Here's how I can make this happen. It's a
[04:08:46] campaign plan. Oh, I got to get a cheaper rent right now so I can save more money. I got to get
[04:08:50] some additional income. You go through it. Another one you got in here is, what is it becoming an
[04:08:55] instructor? Right? Like, these are things that you're doing to, you've actually taken these
[04:09:01] methodologies and applied them to your life. And it's not complicated. Next phase is approach.
[04:09:09] This is where we create our approach. We have already determined our long-term goal, our mission,
[04:09:13] our 300 meter target. We have also identified our lines of effort, the broad conceptual categories
[04:09:19] along which we will advance. In phase four, we are going to implement the list of tasks and
[04:09:23] considerations. We identified through research the series of short-term goals that exist between
[04:09:27] where we are now and where we are trying to go along our lines of advance. These are our objectives
[04:09:38] our 25, 50, 100 and 200 meter targets. Here is where we prioritize, organize and correlate
[04:09:46] along the timeline. So again, there's another place where people can get caught up, right? Oh,
[04:09:51] I created a good idea. I have a good plan. And then they don't execute on it. They don't, they don't,
[04:09:57] well, not that they don't execute, we're going to get there, but they don't figure out what do I
[04:10:00] need to actually do to get there? Like, okay, I see that I want a new house. I know I need money.
[04:10:06] How am I going to get more money? That's what this is. What are you going to, what do you do?
[04:10:10] What are you going to actually make happen here? Freaking, again, these things seem obvious.
[04:10:17] Yes. It's, it's really not that complicated. And I think a lot of people ask that question how
[04:10:27] to whoever they look up to will learn from wanting a complicated answer, because it just
[04:10:34] enables the excuse. Well, this is just too complex. Well, he's a seal. He's a green beret.
[04:10:41] Like I can't, I'm not either of those things. So this doesn't apply to me. It's like, it's actually
[04:10:46] quite simple. It's not necessarily easy, but it is simple. Yeah. The amount of times I've been asked,
[04:10:54] how do you get up early in the morning? And my response is, oh, I set my alarm clock or when
[04:10:58] it goes off, I get out of bed. That's legitimately what it is. Yeah. So when your alarm clock goes
[04:11:06] off, you get out of bed. That's what you do. That must be, it's simple, not easy. Simple.
[04:11:15] That freaking pillow, that pillow grabs a hold to echo Charles over there. I think
[04:11:19] you get strangled by that. You can put a chokehold over there. It's very dangerous.
[04:11:25] Here's another place people miss out. You got to execute. Phase five, execute, discipline. Discipline
[04:11:31] is controlled behavior. In other words, it is the combination of sacrifice and time prioritization.
[04:11:38] Warrior ethos one, I will always place the mission first with discipline. We are stopping
[04:11:43] ourselves from doing what we like or want to do and or forcing ourselves to do things we need to do.
[04:11:57] That's another thing. I'll use that answer sometimes. Like, you know what you need to do.
[04:12:04] Actually know what you need to do. You're just not doing it.
[04:12:07] Like you're not going to get better at jujitsu, not doing jujitsu. You're not going to get in
[04:12:10] good shape by not working out. You know what you need to do. Like you said, I think there's people
[04:12:16] that want you to say, well, there's a big complex thing that we need to discuss. There's actually
[04:12:21] not. There's actually not. Just stop doing it. Just stop doing it. Focus to remain disciplined.
[04:12:33] We must remain focused. This right here is essential. We have our plan. It's broken down into a
[04:12:38] series of objectives. Each objective has a series of requirements and tasks that we must accomplish
[04:12:42] to reach objective secure. We know there will be a host of challenges and obstacles along the way
[04:12:47] we anticipate setbacks. We project failures. We are prepared. But what are we actually focusing
[04:12:53] on during the process? The reality of it is it's our choice. Picture you getting your purple belt
[04:13:00] here, by the way, 2016. Check. How many times a week you train? Now? Yeah. I'm coming off a
[04:13:13] shoulder surgery. So none, but usually two, three days. Uh huh. Yeah. What happened to shoulder?
[04:13:20] I told my labrum. Doing jujitsu? No, this was just wear and tear, but I completely dislocated it back
[04:13:28] in 14 in a jujitsu tournament. Shredded the labrum. Put it back together. Wait, 2014,
[04:13:37] isn't that when you were still a white belt? I think I, in this particular tournament, I just
[04:13:43] belted blue. Yeah. There's a lot of people that were unhappy the day they saw you in the freaking
[04:13:48] bracket. You know what I'm saying? Well, I mean, especially it's, you know, it's a weight class
[04:13:55] sport, right? So I mean, from the waist up, if you looked at me versus my opponents, like,
[04:14:00] there's no way these guys are in the same weight class. Oh, shit. How much do you weigh right
[04:14:04] now? Right now, I'm probably 215. What would you weigh if you had your other leg? 250? Yeah,
[04:14:12] that's, you know, that's 45 pounds of leg is just not there anymore. Wait, so you said right now,
[04:14:17] you weigh what right now? About 215. 215. Yeah, that's messing up some people's,
[04:14:24] some people have bummed out where they see that bracket. They're looking at you going,
[04:14:28] there's, hey, get a scale. Yeah. And I went to the hospital, I learned a lot from Anthony Robles,
[04:14:35] all American wrestler born with one leg at Arizona State. I read his book, Unstoppable,
[04:14:40] to help me with my training. And it's funny, there's an excerpt in the book from his mother
[04:14:43] who talks about how when he was real young, the other parents would be like, Hey, this isn't fair.
[04:14:49] He only has one leg, like go easy on him, you know, because he was learning how to do it. So
[04:14:53] they, they noticed that as a disadvantage and they felt bad for him. Well, once he got real good
[04:15:00] and beefed up his upper body, it was the complete opposite where now the parents are going, this
[04:15:04] isn't fair because he's wrestling at, you know, 205, but really he's got the upper body of someone
[04:15:10] who's 235. So it just went to complete 180. It's like, I can take advantage of this. Yeah. Yeah.
[04:15:18] Damn. You got a section in this part, hard work now that we choose to stay on track,
[04:15:26] it's time to put in the work. Here's where the tangible gains are made bottom line up front.
[04:15:32] Good things come to those who work hard. Great things, however, come to those who are willing
[04:15:37] to do whatever it takes to those who are willing to push themselves to a higher level.
[04:15:41] We're going a little beyond hard work. We're going to freaking Nick style structure.
[04:15:51] Our daily structure informs us of what are we, what we are doing and when this is, of course,
[04:15:54] created based on many of the objective, secure considerations and requirements. And like any
[04:15:59] schedule, this provides us with some structure, a guide. And, and you got some cool examples of,
[04:16:07] of your freaking schedule and stuff in here. I wanted to point this out cost of ambition.
[04:16:15] We can quickly disregard those who genuinely don't want to see us succeed. They are relevant. So
[04:16:21] there's no associated cost. The haters of the world suffer from insecurity. They lack confidence.
[04:16:28] They look to tear down somebody rather than build themselves up because it's easier. They're weak,
[04:16:32] ignore and move on easy. Our loved ones want our time because they love us in the onset.
[04:16:40] They are genuinely supportive of the goal, cheering us on any way possible. Then the realization sets
[04:16:45] in that in order to accomplish this mission, we are going to have to prioritize the task necessary
[04:16:49] to reach the objective along the way. This takes time, time that is spent elsewhere. There's going
[04:16:54] to be some friction here. Yeah, especially those that, you know, have spouses, kids. This is where
[04:17:01] this is where this gets tough. Yeah. How old are your kids right now? Five and 16 months.
[04:17:07] That's awesome. Freaking outstanding.
[04:17:12] Fear. They don't want to see us disappointed. Manage your expectations. Don't get your hopes out.
[04:17:17] Up. This is out of love. Big goals are inherently a long shot. We, we have accepted the fact that
[04:17:22] there will always be failures along the way. We have accepted the fact that it's going to be painful.
[04:17:25] Resentment. So it's good to think about that resentment. Number one, to make sure that you're
[04:17:32] not getting caught up in it because this thing will eat you alive, man. And the biblical story of
[04:17:40] Cain and Abel. I've talked about this a lot. Cain was so resentful of Abel that he literally killed
[04:17:46] his brother. Just literally killed his brother. Right? We use the term brother in the most, the
[04:17:55] strongest bond we can possibly have with another human. And this guy killed his brother because he
[04:18:00] was resentful. So you got to watch out for it in yourself. And you've also got to watch out for
[04:18:06] another people when those around us see our drive, our work ethic, our dedication, they too may feel
[04:18:12] obligated to perform oftentimes as a positive chain reaction, accepted with gratitude and
[04:18:16] resulting in output. This may also, however, have a negative response. It is not a catalyst for
[04:18:23] performance. They can, they cannot refuse to reciprocate, which results in a feeling of laziness
[04:18:28] or lack of ambition. Similarly, some have also attempted to achieve the goal themselves and
[04:18:32] were defeated. Our success will affirm their inability to do the same in both cases, rather
[04:18:37] than being a source of motivation, we can become a source of resentment. We must also be aware of
[04:18:42] the flip side of the same coin when our ambition and determination are not reciprocated by those
[04:18:47] around us, our loved ones, it can result in our resentment towards them. You got to watch out for
[04:18:52] that one. Sneaky, sneaks up on you. You know, it's one of my buddies was trying to, Seth Stone was
[04:19:01] trying to go, he's like, Hey, I want to go to, I want to go to Princeton. There was like a program
[04:19:07] to go to Princeton while you're in the SEAL teams. And he asked me like, Hey, do you think I should
[04:19:13] go? I was like, hell yeah, man. And he's like, Well, some of the other guys are telling me,
[04:19:15] don't go, it's not going to be bad for my career. I was like, bro, how's it going to be bad for
[04:19:20] your career to be a SEAL officer that went to freaking Princeton and has a degree in international
[04:19:25] policy? Like who said that? And I think it's the same thing. People just didn't want him to get that
[04:19:31] little extra little thing going on his life. A little resentment coming through. Yeah, maybe.
[04:19:37] Watch out for that one. Community to put it bluntly, if we hang around with losers, we'll
[04:19:44] become a loser. That one's kind of speaks for itself. I think the classic is you are the average
[04:19:51] of the five you spend the most time with, you know, which I don't think is like statistically
[04:19:56] accurate, but anecdotally and common sense wise, that makes sense to me. For sure. For sure.
[04:20:01] And by again, I'm you've got all kinds of backing up data and stories and information to
[04:20:08] to explain these things. I'm just trying to hit the high point so people know
[04:20:12] that when they get this book, they're going to get a legitimate guide on how to do how to live.
[04:20:18] Consistency, unfortunately, it's easy. It's easy to be great for a day. Anybody can do it. But the
[04:20:24] other 364 days that make the difference. And this is truly the most challenging aspect of execution
[04:20:30] consistency. That catches a lot of people off guard. Discipline, hard work and consistency.
[04:20:37] How can you stop someone who is willing to stay on track, despite temptation,
[04:20:41] someone who's willing to sacrifice and put in hard work, someone who's willing to dedicate
[04:20:44] himself or her self on a daily basis? How can you stop someone who is willing to do whatever it
[04:20:50] takes? The answer is you can't. Phase six track, there's no reason to over complicate this one.
[04:21:01] It's simple. This is simply keeping track of what you are doing and how you are doing.
[04:21:06] It's a diary really for for all my alpha tough guys out there. You will likely refer to this as a log.
[04:21:13] But that's all it is. We are logging our actions, what we're doing, how we're doing it.
[04:21:17] How what's the oldest log? You got logs from your freaking college workouts? Oh yeah,
[04:21:21] go back decades. Yeah, yeah, old school. Yeah. I've got some, I've got some old, old. I have
[04:21:29] the little right in the rain notebooks. And so I've got that I just always track a workout in.
[04:21:34] And I've got probably, what is it 2022? I might have 15 years worth of I could pull up. I'm gonna
[04:21:46] have to check that one. I pulled I had to pull it up. I really, we had a little situation unfold
[04:21:51] that whole situation. Well, we, we, we, there was a guy that did a did a video about me being on
[04:21:59] steroids and I've never done steroids. And you know, he kind of broke down. He had broken down
[04:22:07] like what we had said on this one particular video where we were, we were kind of just having fun
[04:22:13] and bullshit and back and forth and you know, talking about Echo's skinny knees. And a lot of
[04:22:20] people sat down. And anyways, you know, this guy, his name, he's got a video, a thing called more
[04:22:29] plates, more dates. Good, good dude. His name is Derek. Anyways, he made a video and he just did
[04:22:34] like an assessment. I competed in jujitsu. I like he just did an assessment. It's like, oh yeah,
[04:22:38] he's probably on TRT and probably juiced at one time. And I just, we just made one back and said
[04:22:44] like, Hey, no, actually, I, I haven't. And I, I realized that there was things that I said
[04:22:52] that made him think, well, oh, Jaco says he can, you know, squat 405 for 20 reps, which I kind of
[04:22:58] like, I don't know if I actually said, yeah, or 10 reps or whatever it was. But I, I'd said it
[04:23:03] bullshit with Echo on the podcast and was even a real podcast. We were just kind of like it was
[04:23:07] before. So it was that I said, I worked out four times a day. Like there's some little clip where
[04:23:12] I'm like, Oh, four times a day. And I had to clarify what I mean is like, Oh, on a good day,
[04:23:17] I lift, I run, I go to jujitsu and I surf. Those are all some physical, those are all tiring, right?
[04:23:23] But they're not like I didn't do some crazy workouts. So anyways, while we were doing that,
[04:23:30] I kind of went back and just kind of reviewed, you know, just to get some real numbers out there
[04:23:36] where I said, Hey, here's what, here's an actual number. This is the time. So that's why that's
[04:23:41] like the last time. But I got just like stacks of these little notebooks, you know, but journaling.
[04:23:48] You're talking about journaling over there, man. Yeah, man, some alpha males are going to get freaking
[04:23:53] distraught. That's why I talk about it as much as I do. Because what are you going to do? You're
[04:23:58] going to call me a bitch? I mean, really, really? You know, that's not like you go talking. It's
[04:24:03] like one, I don't care. And two, like, okay, good luck with that. But like journaling, logging,
[04:24:09] there's a huge part of my day to day. And I'm like, I'll scream that from the rooftops.
[04:24:13] And it's always good. Like I, I since I track my since I write down, I can't track is a strong word
[04:24:19] for me. But what I like about it is, over time, if you're not careful, you can start to, like,
[04:24:28] let some things slide a little bit, you know, you like, Well, you know, I only really need to do
[04:24:33] this or I only really do that. Or what could I actually do? This is good enough, I think. And
[04:24:40] I had had this conversation with the Bert Soren from Soren X, you know, I'm talking about.
[04:24:45] And I was like, man, there's exercises that I do just to make sure that I don't lose that capability,
[04:24:50] like whatever it is, whatever that exercise is, muscle ups, like overhead squats, like I had a
[04:24:56] hurt elbow for a year, man, I could not do an overhead squat, couldn't do it. Maybe it wasn't
[04:25:02] a year. But you know, in my little logbook, it says elbow still hurt, you know, they can't do
[04:25:08] overhead squats. So I know what's going on. I know why I'm not doing it. Those little things
[04:25:14] to put in there, do you use any like the electronic tracking devices of your sleep or your, whatever?
[04:25:21] No, not yet. No, not yet. I mean, the technology seems to make a lot of sense.
[04:25:25] I haven't, I haven't found a gap yet where I may need to know that I got 6.125 hours of sleep at
[04:25:35] 75% efficiency. I think I don't know what difference it would make. Like it's time to get up, period.
[04:25:42] So that's it. My watch says I only got, you know, 40% quality suite. It's like, it doesn't matter.
[04:25:47] Yeah. Actually, I was talking to JP and he said, so he was doing my buddy JP and he said that he
[04:25:56] started sort of his attitude would adjust based on what his, he stopped wearing it because it's,
[04:26:01] it would say, oh, you need more rest. And he'd be like, oh, this workout's good. And he, and he
[04:26:07] said, he took it off, bro. He was like, I'm not doing this. Cause it doesn't matter. Like you just
[04:26:11] said, Hey, I'm up. This is the workout. I have to do. I'm going to go do it. When you see, hey,
[04:26:16] you're only at 27% recovery. Man, come on. Start to feel it.
[04:26:26] Phase seven, assess. This is where we analyze the state of our situation and identify areas of
[04:26:32] progress stagnation and or regression. Again, how often are we going through life without actually
[04:26:40] assessing where we're at? What's going on? What's our status? What adjustments do we need to make?
[04:26:47] Like this seems so obvious, but guaranteed, guaranteed. I would actually say most people
[04:26:55] aren't assessing where they're at. Maybe they do it. Oh, you know, when they do it is, what's the
[04:27:01] new year, right? The new year. The resolution. Yeah. They're like, Hey, you know, I need to do this now.
[04:27:07] But this is something you should be doing all the time. Where are you at? I used to tell the,
[04:27:14] I used to trick though, when I taught the young junior officers, one of the little tricks I would
[04:27:20] play, I'm going to say, what's the most important piece of information that you need on the battlefield?
[04:27:23] And they would be like, where the enemy is, how many weapons they have, how many there are. And
[04:27:27] I'd be like, no, the most important thing you need to know is where you are. So that's what
[04:27:31] that's about. Assessment. Where are you at? So you can make changes to your course and get it
[04:27:38] corrected. Honesty is what's critical with this, which a lot of us struggle with, man,
[04:27:43] especially with social media, like what people project oftentimes isn't real.
[04:27:49] And you get so conditioned to projecting this facade that you believe it yourself.
[04:27:55] That's going to hurt. In order for this to have any kind of significance of value,
[04:28:02] you need to have that internal no shit dialogue, where you can be honest with yourself. Like,
[04:28:07] where am I currently at? Forget about my last Instagram post, which has 17 filters on it.
[04:28:12] I took 57 different attempts for the perfect angle. Forget that. And your caption, that was very
[04:28:17] enlightening. Sure, forget that. Like, look yourself in the mirror. Like, what is my current status?
[04:28:22] And be honest with yourself. You're gonna bullshit yourself and forget about all this.
[04:28:26] It's not going to matter. It's one thing that's nice about Jiu-Jitsu. You can't bullshit your partner.
[04:28:33] It doesn't work. This just doesn't work. That's another reason for me. Like,
[04:28:39] I have those logboots in my workout so I can say, man, you know what? I don't really need to do that.
[04:28:45] Oh, wait a second. Let me look at what I see what I was doing two years ago. Oh, I was actually doing
[04:28:49] this many reps or this many sets or whatever. And that's what it Oh, it keeps me keeps me honest,
[04:28:56] actually. Absolutely. No, no. Um, phase eight repeat has the goal changed. If the answer is yes,
[04:29:03] then repeat the process. That means go all the way back to the beginning and do this assessment.
[04:29:07] Again, if the answer is no, repeat the process with specific and intentional adjustments based on
[04:29:12] the identified lags or deficiencies, boom, execute back to work, move out, continue to gather the
[04:29:20] data, stay the course, trust the process. We cannot make brash decisions. Odds are there are
[04:29:25] variables within our equation that are working. The only way to determine what is creating positive
[04:29:30] effects is through small incremental adjustments over time. It's hard. This separates the average
[04:29:37] from the greats. If it were easy, everybody would do it. Repeat, repeat, repeat. The process
[04:29:43] does not stop focus. It is worth it. So again, those were the highlights to this.
[04:29:55] This guide, this, this methodology, the sort of military, the military planning wrapped around
[04:30:06] what you could use for everyday life. Freaking legit, man. Thank you. Freaking legit.
[04:30:14] So that's kind of, that kind of gets us up to speed, right? How, how many years you've been
[04:30:19] in the army for right now? 15. I guess you're going to stay for 20. At this point, man,
[04:30:26] it would have to take something real convincing to get me out of here. How to know what the hell
[04:30:31] would get you out of here at this point. You got any, are you starting to look at what you
[04:30:37] might do after the military? Yeah. So I mean, it's, I'm going to continue to write because,
[04:30:43] again, I found out that I actually enjoy it. So I got a few projects I kind of work on. Well,
[04:30:47] you did spend seven years in college. So you got some experience at it. Got some lessons learned.
[04:30:54] Yeah. A little bit. So continue to write because I enjoy it. And then I'm not working for anybody
[04:31:05] else ever again. After 20 years, I'll work with a lot of people, but I'm going to choose who I work
[04:31:11] with. But the days of people telling me what to do will be over once I get that DD 214 in my hands.
[04:31:18] And so I see myself doing consulting, speaking, workshop, seminar type stuff. And I got a small
[04:31:28] crew around me now that are in line with that successful buddies of mine and some family that
[04:31:37] are doing well in life, but feel unfulfilled. My buddies, they work for Salesforce and they
[04:31:43] make a ton of cash. They live in Manhattan. Wow, they successful. But it's like, do I want to look
[04:31:50] back on my death bed at 80 and been like, I sold a lot of software and I had a really nice house.
[04:31:55] Or do I want to do something to sink my teeth into something that I'm proud of that gives me
[04:31:59] some fulfillment. So just turning that into a from what is now a nights and weekends kind of
[04:32:05] side thing to just what I do full time. Where will you raise your family once you get out?
[04:32:12] It's a good question. My wife and I have in this conversation right now. I would like to go back up
[04:32:18] north. But I want land as well. So I'd like to be able to live ideal for me maybe as like western
[04:32:28] or central mass where I can get my family because it's all about what culture don't want to raise
[04:32:32] my kids in. That's the conversation her and I are having. I think that there's a lot of value. I grew
[04:32:37] up in more of an urban environment where there's the edgy fast thinking wittiness that comes.
[04:32:44] The expression is with New York. If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere because it's
[04:32:47] tough. You take someone from that environment, that culture, put them into a much slower environment
[04:32:53] like Tennessee where I'm at now. Yeah, they'll probably be frustrated because things are moving
[04:32:56] at a slower pace, but they're going to do well because they can move fast and talk fast and
[04:33:01] think fast. Where if you take someone who grew up in some, you know, backwards area and threw them
[04:33:06] in Manhattan, they're just overwhelmed by events. So I'd like to really give my kids a taste of that
[04:33:13] high tempo environment, but I don't want to necessarily like live in that environment.
[04:33:18] Yeah, I think there's a good, if you can get somehow, get both those, get your kids in both
[04:33:24] those environments where they spend some time where they're like in the city scenario and they
[04:33:28] spend some times where they're out in the country scenario. Because you know, you also have those
[04:33:34] kids that like they're out in the field and there's like a rattlesnake and they just like grab a stick,
[04:33:40] you know, hold the things head down, pick it up, swing it up against the tree and kill it, you
[04:33:43] know, you're like, that's pretty legit. Absolutely. So you get, you can, and you can kids are, their
[04:33:50] minds don't get developed even remotely to the capacity that they've got, you know. So if you
[04:33:55] can get a little bit of that, both, you know, you get them in the city sometimes where they're
[04:34:00] comfortable with that, you get them in the country sometimes where they're comfortable with that.
[04:34:05] I think that, I think that's optimal. You know, same thing, man. Got some space, you know, get a
[04:34:11] little range set up out there, some quiet, some lands, made TVs, some, you know, some hiking
[04:34:16] trails, do some outdoorsy stuff. But then, you know, I'm two and a half, three hours outside of
[04:34:20] Boston where I can go in. Yeah, you need, you might need to go to New Hampshire or Maine or
[04:34:24] something for that kind of scenario. I could see that. Because I can't, I don't see you having a
[04:34:27] range anywhere in your backyard in Massachusetts. Is that even possible? Legally? It might be tough.
[04:34:36] It might be tough if you had the land. But that type of dynamic, I think, is the goal for both of us.
[04:34:42] Right. Right. But you got to have, you also have, man, you got some roots in Boston, man,
[04:34:49] where you want them to have. You want them to have a Boston accent? I try to indoctrinate them
[04:34:53] into that now, you know. And they, you know, my oldest is five. He doesn't have, I'd say, a Tennessee
[04:34:59] accent yet, but he uses some of the vernacular down there, you know, the y'all and the, and the
[04:35:04] whatever. And I'll correct him on how to pronounce words with an accent, you know, because he's
[04:35:08] learning how to read and write. And he's like, you know, C-A-I, he's like, you know, car. And I'm
[04:35:14] like, it's car. Say it again, car. He's like, no, dad, it's car. I'm like, negative. It's car. My
[04:35:22] wife is like, would you leave him alone? Where's your wife from originally? Milwaukee. They kind of
[04:35:28] have not much of an accent, right? It's kind of like a Chicago thing. It's a little Chicago. It's
[04:35:33] like, yeah, don't you know, it's kind of like Minnesota, Minnesota thing, Southern Canada type
[04:35:38] thing. Hers isn't isn't really that thick. Some of her family is right on. Awesome, man. I think
[04:35:46] that's probably a pretty good place. Echo Charles. Yes, sir. You got any questions?
[04:35:52] Well, I was going to ask about Jiu Jitsu, but we kind of talked about it, you know,
[04:35:55] why would you want to ask? Just, you know, how's the training? When are you getting back to training?
[04:36:00] Because your shoulder and stuff, right? Yeah, man, I'm probably another eight, nine weeks out
[04:36:04] before the docs will clear me from that. And there'll be a slow progression back. But I'm not
[04:36:09] trained in Jiu Jitsu like I used to. I did deprioritize it where I was real heavy into it and competing
[04:36:17] and like real aggressive and like enhancing my skill and my technical capacity. Now I get in
[04:36:23] there a couple days a week just to just to keep a finger on the pulse and enjoy it kind of open
[04:36:27] mat style. And I help with the instruction of my son who's in Jiu Jitsu now. That's one. Yeah,
[04:36:33] that's kind of a natural progression for a lot of people, right? Especially when you get kids and,
[04:36:38] you know, all this stuff. It's like, you keep Jiu Jitsu, but you
[04:36:41] you deprioritize it a little bit. Yeah, that makes sense. How's your kid like Jiu Jitsu?
[04:36:47] He struggles with it a bit because it's there's a lot of free time where they're trying to teach
[04:36:53] some real technical stuff. And he doesn't do well when he's told to just sit there and like pay
[04:36:57] attention. He's five. He's five. I very seldom because I taught kids classes for a long time.
[04:37:04] Now, including my own kids classes. If five is really young, man, it's almost like when they're
[04:37:09] five, you should have a half an hour class. Because you just get them out there and keep it fun.
[04:37:15] They already know how to wrestle. Like it's it's it's a natural thing. So if you just say put some
[04:37:21] rules around what they already know, some very basic rules, they'll have fun. And the funner,
[04:37:26] you can make it man, the better off you're going to be. And you know, I'm sure you've heard me
[04:37:31] talk about this before, but like I pushed you to too hard on my kids when they were younger,
[04:37:35] like competing. They trained seven days a week. That's a lot. Yeah, seven days a week. And we
[04:37:42] were just I was just talking about with my kids the other day. It'd be like on Saturday, we'd get
[04:37:46] hit we'd get to this gym at eight o'clock in the morning. And like I would teach their striking
[04:37:51] class. And then I'd bring them up and teach their jiu-jitsu class. And then I would train
[04:37:56] for two hours or two and a half hours. So they'd be here. Just in this gym, ages like five through
[04:38:04] eight for like five, six hours Saturday and Sunday. That's aggressive. It's not the best protocol.
[04:38:15] That's aggressive. I would have been done a better job. Now look, they're coming back to it. I mean,
[04:38:20] one of my daughters is like training. She trained more than that right now. You know, she's getting
[04:38:24] after an echo nose. Yes, sir. Echo almost lost his arm to her the other day. She was getting hostile.
[04:38:28] Every time I come in here, she's here. Yeah. No matter what time, by the way. How old is she?
[04:38:32] 21. Oh yeah. But she wrestled in high school and stuff. She's down for the cause. But yeah,
[04:38:39] you can't get two. You gotta let you gotta make them love it. Yeah. We scaled it back. It was
[04:38:44] twice a week. And now we're doing like one. And then we brought in some gymnastics. And he does
[04:38:49] like this little CrossFit like a class thing. It's just it's just there's more movement
[04:38:53] hell yeah with those things, which is good for him. Well, this was the main point I want to make.
[04:38:57] My son had a friend because I would like try and get every kid in the neighborhood to train jiu-jitsu.
[04:39:01] And my son had a friend who I brought him in. We was five. He hated it. I brought him in when
[04:39:06] like literally a year later, he was six, hated it. He was seven, hated it. He was eight, hated it.
[04:39:12] And finally when he was like nine, all of a sudden it clicked and he was like, Oh, I understand
[04:39:16] what all this means and what this could help me with. And it, you know, and he started training
[04:39:20] all the time. And it wasn't like he was then five years behind my son. You know what I mean?
[04:39:27] Like the kids are only going to learn so much and they can learn so rapidly that once they get
[04:39:31] engulfed in it, they'll catch up pretty quick. So you don't have to worry like, this is a wasted
[04:39:36] year. Go freaking full, go freaking full Nick Lavery on him like, you missed a training opportunity,
[04:39:42] son. That's a good, that's actually a good point. Yeah. Cause they'll be able to make up for it.
[04:39:47] And if they, if they're into it, man, that's worth, that's worth it. Look, we can find you.
[04:39:53] People can find you machine Nick.com. That's it. You're, you have a YouTube channel. You have
[04:40:01] Instagram, which is Nick at Nick.machine.lavery. Lavery is L A V E R Y. Any closing thoughts, Nick?
[04:40:16] I appreciate the invitation, man. I, you're in this book. You didn't, you didn't read the pots
[04:40:20] where I mentioned you personally. Dude, I totally appreciate it. It feels weird. I bet it does.
[04:40:26] No, it's fine. But just a level of gratitude to the lessons I learned from you and from these
[04:40:32] works. You know, once I did realize that leadership is as a skill, although some people may be
[04:40:42] genetically enhanced based on character traits, it's a skill that requires reps like anything else.
[04:40:48] And you were the first dude that I found the first mentor I found when I realized that I had that gap
[04:40:55] and that there was a difference and I drove down that road. So a lot of my operational and personal
[04:41:01] successes are from your works and the way you message that. So I'm a, I'm a fan. So it's an
[04:41:08] honor to be here and just spend some time with you, man. So I appreciate it. No, that's awesome.
[04:41:13] And, um, you know, my last job in the SEAL teams was running training and there was so rewarding.
[04:41:23] I kind of already mentioned it, but having guys come back from combat and say, hey, we got out
[04:41:28] of this situation because of what you taught us and now having been doing this stuff, you know,
[04:41:36] the amount of feedback that I get like that, man, it's just, it feels good to pass that information
[04:41:42] on and you're going to get the same feedback, you know, on your story, on the lessons you learned,
[04:41:49] on the methodology you put forth in your book. So I appreciate you taking that and, and running with
[04:41:55] it. And it, that's, that's what we got to do, you know, we got to take care of the next generation.
[04:42:02] So I appreciate it, man. That means a lot. And yes, it was a little, I did purposely avoid the
[04:42:07] parts of the book. But all good, man. I want to read one last thing. Just because I think it's
[04:42:16] closes out the message really solid from the book. I was not genetically gifted with any
[04:42:20] astonishing talents. I don't come from a family of wealth. I make mistakes constantly. I lose focus.
[04:42:26] I procrastinate. I waste time. I feel pain. I experience fear. I bleed. I am not cut from a
[04:42:32] different cloth. I am not from another planet. I am a human, same as you, which means we have
[04:42:39] the ability to choose. It doesn't matter what we do for a living, how much money we have in the bank,
[04:42:46] the size of our house, the disability we live with, who we care for, who cares for us, the car we
[04:42:51] drive, if we have a car at all, how popular we are, or how much we can bench. It does not matter.
[04:43:00] We must simply decide. This is what I believe. This is who I am going to become. And I am willing
[04:43:11] to put it all on the line to achieve it. So there you go, man. You live in proof of those words.
[04:43:23] Thanks for joining us, man. Thanks for sharing your story, your strategies for victory.
[04:43:32] And most important, thank you for your continued service and sacrifice. You set an example for
[04:43:40] all of us. And the next generation that's coming up is going to be looking at you and knowing
[04:43:45] that they can get things done. And it's an example, not just how to live, but how to live right.
[04:43:55] So thanks, brother. I appreciate it, bro. And with that, Nick, slavery, the machine
[04:44:03] has left the building appropriate, fully appropriate, right? Yes. You're not like, well,
[04:44:11] that's no. What a freaking stud, man. In the classic Hackworth sense of the word. You know
[04:44:20] what, Hackworth? Yeah, no. That's the way he describes his two categories of people.
[04:44:28] Studs and duds. Hopeless in the hard part. But like, like the most, the best thing he can describe,
[04:44:35] he goes, this guy was a stud. That's like his big, his big statement. But yeah, man, Nick,
[04:44:42] just amazing human out there, crushing. And what a beast, man. Here's a small point of contention,
[04:44:56] which you just alluded to before you hit record. He says he has no, not genetically gifted.
[04:45:02] He's a little bit too many. I was going to chime in. You were sounding good. I was like, well,
[04:45:08] you are a monster. Yeah. He's a, he's a massive monster of a human being. Yeah. And then,
[04:45:15] but then I was thinking about that. 300 pounds as a bouncer. How tall he say he was? Six, five.
[04:45:21] Six, five. He said he shot up to six, five. I was looking at him. I'm evaluating, I'm thinking
[04:45:24] six, five, six, six. That's what I'm thinking. Not a small human. No, giant. And you can get by,
[04:45:32] you can get by with that in life. But then you can go to the next level. Yeah. And he's not like a
[04:45:39] sloppy, like two, you know, even how big he is, he's not like a, and I'm not saying all because
[04:45:44] it's, I'm not saying that, but there's a difference between just being big and sort of lurchy and
[04:45:48] maybe sloppy and like a six, five stud as it were. See what I'm saying? And he was for sure that.
[04:45:54] So I can imagine him eating with a diet coach and all this stuff. Yeah. I didn't do a good job.
[04:46:00] I didn't do a good job of capturing the fact of like the discipline that he imposes in his life
[04:46:08] to achieve these goals. Look, it kind of is clear that you have to, but you know, he's, you know,
[04:46:13] this, how many calories I'm eating at this time. This is what I'm doing here. This is the workout
[04:46:16] on this, the stretching, this is mobility. This is the time, you know, 0400 Reveley, 0428, you know,
[04:46:23] in the gym, 0521 starting cardio, 0610 first calorie intake, 700 via egg, you know, like that
[04:46:33] kind of thing. Bro, he said something or the one part that really I was like, bro, that's so true.
[04:46:39] If you can just remember that because, you know, he mentioned tunnel vision at one point, he
[04:46:42] mentioned tunnel vision, right? About when he was just thinking about his own goals kind of thing.
[04:46:46] I was like, bro, I think that that's like an asset, that tunnel vision, because that's really a big
[04:46:52] part of what discipline is, is not getting distracted by other stuff, including like your
[04:46:56] own feelings, right? So you guys, both of you guys are talking about like, when you wake up in the
[04:47:00] morning, you just do it, you're not distracted about how you feel, how much sleep you may or
[04:47:04] may not have gotten, you know, the weather or all this stuff, whatever. You're just not distracted
[04:47:08] by that. You just sort of do it, right? So technically, distraction is kind of the main
[04:47:13] enemy of discipline. And he mentioned it. I was like, I was just like tunnel vision. I was like,
[04:47:17] yeah, that is, huh? If you can maintain tunnel vision and leverage that, bro, you can kind of do
[04:47:22] anything. And this is the part where I was like, bro, that's so true. I hope to remember this
[04:47:28] at times that'll benefit me, where he was like, he was talking about getting in and out of the
[04:47:33] vehicle, right? Where he's like having trouble. So he's just practicing. He's like, if I can do this
[04:47:37] a thousand times, I'll be good. I'll be good. Good to do. Yeah, I'll be good. And I was like,
[04:47:41] bro, that's so true. And, you know, and we know it like we know it, but it's like, okay, so you
[04:47:46] need these guys like, uh, what's the group, the acrobat group, like a Cirque du Soleil or something
[04:47:53] or, you know, whatever you called it. Yeah. And they do these things. You're like, how the heck
[04:47:58] can they just nail that? It's so precise or whatever. But then you think about it in those
[04:48:03] terms where if it's like, yeah, let me do this a thousand times, let me do this 10,000 times.
[04:48:06] Let me do this. I mean, probably even more than that. Just do it that many times. And it's just
[04:48:09] so automatic, just like anything else you do, not anything else, but like a lot of stuff you
[04:48:13] already do as a human, like walking. Probably you ever consider about what your body has to do
[04:48:18] to just stand up and walk like your little feet and all this stuff. So it's like, man, you just
[04:48:23] got to put it into perspective. It's like, yeah, you just apply that to like kind of hard stuff.
[04:48:27] And probably you can do it, but you got to maintain that tunnel vision though in a way.
[04:48:30] Yeah. And the tunnel vision you got to watch out for because he got tunnel vision just focused
[04:48:35] on himself. But I, what I liked the power when he was like, oh, when it was about me, he was
[04:48:42] working hard. When he realized it was about his teammates and his teammates, kids and wives.
[04:48:48] He's like, I can get another freaking rep. Watch this. You know what I'm saying? So
[04:48:55] you know, you are much less likely to allow yourself to let your friend down than to let
[04:49:03] yourself down. You know, that's why people need a workout buddy, right? Like, Hey, are you going
[04:49:07] to be there? Yeah, I'm going to be there. You don't want to let your friend down. So you show up.
[04:49:10] They recommend that if you're having trouble getting it done, get a workout buddy. So he had that
[04:49:16] like amplified times 1000 because it's him wanting to be able to execute the job to take care of his
[04:49:25] teammates. That's what this is about. So freaking neck. Awesome. Awesome guy, man. Just an awesome
[04:49:34] guy. Hey, look, no matter where you are in life, you know, you can do a little bit better. Nick is
[04:49:44] good example to all of us. You know, I could probably do a little bit better.
[04:49:49] Everything that I do, every single thing that I, Jocko willing do is a little bit easier for me,
[04:49:54] because I got two freaking legs. Can you imagine jumping off a four foot thing in order to be
[04:49:59] able to do your job that you want to do? You jump off this four foot platform, you got to land in a
[04:50:04] pistol with another random prosthetic legs sticking out and stick the land and stick it.
[04:50:09] By the way, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. So what, you know, they said in the book, if you're
[04:50:15] around Nick, you have no excuses. Well, we're around Nick, man. Nick's out there. Think about that
[04:50:19] right now. So Nick's out there. So the pistol squat thing, sticking the landing, jumping off the
[04:50:24] four foot thing, sticking landing in a pistol, pistol squad. Even if you're not that like,
[04:50:30] impressed with that, what if you were six, five freaking two, you know, two 15, one leg though,
[04:50:37] seem saying like you would have been two 50, the equivalent of like a two 50 seem saying now do it.
[04:50:43] Way more impressive. So we're doing better. If you want to do better, you're going to need to
[04:50:49] work. If you're going to do work, you're going to need to recover. If you need to recover, you need
[04:50:52] the right fuel. You need the right fuel to work sometimes. I want some fuel right now, some
[04:50:56] jockel fuel. I drink some go. It feels good. I feel good. So jockel fuel.com. You can get some fuel.
[04:51:07] Supplementation, supplementation. You can get MOLC. You can get joint warfare.
[04:51:13] Go read the reviews on joint warfare and then press click order because it makes you feel
[04:51:17] good. Yeah, way better. I had a jujitsu sash that was slightly more intense than maybe I was
[04:51:24] I was used to or whatever. No, no problem. But my elbow and shoulder. So I had to double up the
[04:51:29] joint warfare. It's a good move. Hey, that's my life, man. Energy drinks, which we use the term
[04:51:38] in its own category separate from the poison that you may have been drinking. This is energy
[04:51:42] drinks that are good for you actually give you energy and now they taste good. They may not have
[04:51:46] tasted. They might have been not. They may not have been to your liking before. Now they will be.
[04:51:52] We fixed it. We took input. We're not over here like no, no, we took input wanted to taste better.
[04:51:58] Now it tastes better. Now it tastes freaking delicious. So we're up there.
[04:52:02] jockelfuel.com. You can get the drinks at Wawa. You can get this stuff at vitamin shop. You can
[04:52:06] get it at eGB. I owe everyone a list of where you can shop for this stuff. I'll get it out there.
[04:52:11] I'm sorry. jockelfuel.com. Go get some origin USA.com. We didn't even talk really too much
[04:52:17] with Nick about jujitsu, but he did. He did talk about how jujitsu was like a huge part of his
[04:52:23] recovery and what he did. You should be doing jujitsu and you may, you may have previous to
[04:52:29] this podcast had some kind of an excuse as to why you couldn't drain because you have this and you
[04:52:34] have that and you have the other thing. So you don't have an excuse anymore. Nick was a white belt.
[04:52:43] He didn't have, he doesn't have a leg and he got his black belt and competed by the way and and
[04:52:48] competed. So yeah, yeah. And that and so come on. There's a, as far as like, you know, you want to go
[04:52:54] hard into jujitsu, there's different levels, which to me are 100% all of them are 100% acceptable.
[04:53:00] If you just want to train recreationally, you just, you want to train and go hard and see, you
[04:53:04] know, and for your rank or whatever, or you want to train to be a competitor. No, they're all,
[04:53:09] all legitimate, all viable, all viable. You do them all. It takes a lot more to do all these
[04:53:17] insane and this motherfucker did it all. So you are correct. There is no excuse. Yep. We have no

[04:59:00] everybody else out there, just remember what Nick had to say when he's talking about the fact in his
[04:59:07] book that he's not from a rich family. He's not genetically gifted, which that's a little bit
[04:59:14] of contention behind that. But listen, we know this, he's now been physically put into a situation
[04:59:25] where it certainly was not a gift. So he's in a situation right now that's more challenging
[04:59:30] than most of us have. And he makes mistakes, and he feels pain like everybody else. But none of
[04:59:38] that matters. None of that matters. He's not complaining about any of it. What matters is that
[04:59:46] we simply must decide what we're going to do, and who we're going to be. So go make that decision, and
[04:59:55] then get after it. And until next time, the ZECO and Jocko out.
