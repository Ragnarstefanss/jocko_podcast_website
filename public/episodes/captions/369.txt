[00:00:00] This is Johnco podcast number 369 with Echo Charles and me, Johnco Willink.
[00:00:04] Good evening Echo.
[00:00:05] Good evening.
[00:00:06] There's a famous speech.
[00:00:10] I think Tim Ferriss, I might be the first person that I heard talk about this speech.
[00:00:16] The speech is called This is Water.
[00:00:18] It's by a guy named David Foster Wallace and it's a graduation speech.
[00:00:24] You know, when people are graduating from college.
[00:00:26] I'm not going to go into David Foster Wallace's whole life.
[00:00:30] He was a professor.
[00:00:32] He was a writer.
[00:00:34] He was an author of books and he battled with depression his whole life and he eventually
[00:00:39] killed himself, which is awful, horrible.
[00:00:44] But at some point maybe we'll get into that.
[00:00:49] But I want to talk about his speech a little bit because it opens up an idea that I've
[00:00:54] been I've been engaged with for a while now.
[00:00:59] So his speech starts off like this.
[00:01:01] Greetings, parents and congratulations to Kenyon's graduating class of 2005.
[00:01:07] There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming
[00:01:12] the other way who nods at them and says, morning boys, how's the water?
[00:01:17] And the two young fish swim on for a bit and then eventually one of them looks over at
[00:01:21] the other and goes, what the hell is water?
[00:01:29] And so the point of this story is that, you know, we're in water and we're so used to the
[00:01:38] water.
[00:01:39] We're so encompassing the water that we don't even know that we're not.
[00:01:41] We don't notice it.
[00:01:45] Now what does this have to do with anything?
[00:01:47] Well, how does this apply?
[00:01:50] I mean, there's clearly there's a there's a topic that we can get into about appreciating
[00:01:55] life and that's the water that you're in and you can just be not appreciative of it.
[00:02:00] But I was thinking about it from a different perspective and we've talked about before
[00:02:07] on this podcast and you probably heard me say this before the best way to beat someone
[00:02:13] in a game is if they don't even know that they're playing the game.
[00:02:18] It was the best way to beat someone.
[00:02:21] They don't even know that it's happening and you're out maneuvering them because they
[00:02:25] don't know what's happening and then you beat them.
[00:02:28] I mean, it'd be like, imagine you're pre jujitsu, like you didn't know anything about jujitsu
[00:02:33] and you got into a fight with someone and they were doing things.
[00:02:39] You don't even know what they're doing.
[00:02:40] And they're getting the mountain.
[00:02:42] You don't even know what that is.
[00:02:43] So it's not, you're just beating them.
[00:02:44] They don't even know what's happening.
[00:02:46] So the best way to win a competition is for the opponent to not know that there is a competition.
[00:02:54] Sun Su's, we've had, we haven't had Sun Su on this podcast.
[00:02:57] He's been dead for a while, but you know, he, he talked about the goal is to win without
[00:03:02] fighting, right?
[00:03:04] The win without fighting when we want to fight.
[00:03:08] This is also the indirect approach, right?
[00:03:10] I don't want to get go head to head.
[00:03:13] So several months ago, I was talking with one of my friends and someone that I spend
[00:03:19] time with and talk to not all the time, but fairly regularly.
[00:03:24] And we were talking through some of his trials and tribulations and I started talking about
[00:03:29] the game.
[00:03:33] And maybe it was the way that I was referencing it or the way I said it.
[00:03:41] When I talked about it, look in leadership strategy and tactics, I talk about playing
[00:03:44] the game, which is a very specific reference to playing the game in a work environment,
[00:03:51] interacting with other people.
[00:03:53] But when I was talking to this friend of mine, I, I was talking about the game.
[00:03:59] You know, he was going through some stuff and I was talking about the game.
[00:04:04] And as I'm watching his face, as I'm talking about the game that he's engaged in, I really
[00:04:11] realized he didn't know he was in a game.
[00:04:17] Just like the fish not realizing they're in the water.
[00:04:20] So there's things going on in his life.
[00:04:21] There's things going on with his work.
[00:04:22] There's things going on with his marriage and there's maneuvers being made and I can
[00:04:27] see him because he's telling me what they are.
[00:04:29] He's telling me he doesn't realize that it's, that those are moves.
[00:04:36] And I looked at him, I said, like, Hey, you realize that this is a game, right?
[00:04:43] And he just gave me that blank stare and I realized, no, he didn't, he didn't know this
[00:04:47] was a game.
[00:04:50] And over the last several months, I've had a bunch of conversations, not a bunch, but
[00:04:54] I've had several, we'll say conversations like this.
[00:04:59] And I realized that a lot of people don't get this idea of the game that they're in.
[00:05:10] And I know, so I want to spend some time talking about this because I think a lot of people
[00:05:13] don't realize, I think a lot of people don't realize that they're in a game and that there
[00:05:19] is a game.
[00:05:20] In fact, there's multiple games going on.
[00:05:24] And they're in them.
[00:05:26] You're in them.
[00:05:27] I'm in them.
[00:05:30] So if you don't realize that you're in a game, you're not going to win.
[00:05:36] Things are happening and you're not going to win.
[00:05:39] You have to recognize that you're in a game and you actually have to recognize that you're
[00:05:43] in multiple games.
[00:05:45] Remember a long time ago, we had a conversation about ecosystems, right?
[00:05:49] That there's different ecosystems in the world.
[00:05:51] I actually had this conversation with Andrew Huberman recently, you know, talking about
[00:05:55] the ecosystem.
[00:05:56] He's in the ecosystem of academia.
[00:06:00] He's a he's a professor at Stanford.
[00:06:03] He's got a lab like really impressive to some people.
[00:06:07] There's some people that literally do not know where Stanford is.
[00:06:11] There's some people that don't care what kind of schooling you went to.
[00:06:15] There's Jiu Jitsu ecosystem.
[00:06:17] Oh, I'm a purple belt.
[00:06:19] I'm a brown belt.
[00:06:20] There's people that there's people that don't understand that to them a black belt and Jiu
[00:06:24] Jitsu is the same as a black belt and karate, they just like whatever, right?
[00:06:28] There's ecosystems at work.
[00:06:30] The SEAL teams is an ecosystem.
[00:06:31] The different guys in there to try to maneuver, trying to get to the to the to the top of
[00:06:37] that pyramid of the ecosystem.
[00:06:39] And so there's all these ecosystems and in those there's games, right?
[00:06:44] There's games that are being played.
[00:06:45] There's work games.
[00:06:46] There's relationships.
[00:06:49] There's financial games.
[00:06:50] You're in a financial game.
[00:06:52] There's fitness.
[00:06:55] There's a status game.
[00:06:58] There's a materialistic game.
[00:07:00] There's all these games are going in and all those are going on and all those are like
[00:07:05] subordinate games that are going on in your life.
[00:07:08] Possibly.
[00:07:09] You might not care about them.
[00:07:10] You know, you might not be playing one of those games.
[00:07:12] That's okay.
[00:07:13] You might not be playing the Jiu Jitsu game.
[00:07:14] You don't care about Jiu Jitsu.
[00:07:15] You might not be playing the financial game.
[00:07:16] That's okay.
[00:07:18] But you might be.
[00:07:20] You might be playing some of those subordinate games.
[00:07:23] And then there's the supreme game that you are playing, which is life, which is life
[00:07:33] viewed as a game.
[00:07:34] Now, there's sort of a diminishing tone, right?
[00:07:41] To say that something's a game, right?
[00:07:43] There's a diminishing tone because guess what else is a game?
[00:07:45] Tic-Tac-Toe.
[00:07:46] Right.
[00:07:47] Tic-Tac-Toe is a game.
[00:07:49] Diminishing ladders is a game.
[00:07:51] Sure.
[00:07:52] Yeah.
[00:07:53] Right?
[00:07:54] So, sometimes I've said this before.
[00:07:57] This isn't a game, right?
[00:07:58] I've said that before in certain contexts.
[00:08:01] Okay.
[00:08:02] This isn't a game.
[00:08:04] So to now I'm sitting here saying everything's a game, but what we're talking about, I'm
[00:08:07] not trying to devalue.
[00:08:08] I'm not trying to diminish or not trying to depreciate life and I'm not trying to devalue,
[00:08:14] depreciate or diminish some of these like relationship games.
[00:08:18] Like, oh, it's a game to you.
[00:08:19] You see what I'm saying?
[00:08:20] There's a negative connotation, but it depends on the definition that you're going to use.
[00:08:26] And I actually looked around and see if there was another better word, but there actually
[00:08:30] isn't.
[00:08:31] There's just multiple definitions.
[00:08:33] Yes, a game can be Tic-Tac-Toe.
[00:08:34] Yes, game can be shoots and ladders.
[00:08:36] Yes, game can be football game.
[00:08:38] And to compare, you know, people get mad, compare football to like combat.
[00:08:41] Like, what are you doing?
[00:08:43] That's not combat.
[00:08:44] And it's true.
[00:08:45] And I'm not trying to take everything and compare it to shoots and ladders or what's
[00:08:51] the candy game?
[00:08:52] Maybe that was shoots and ladders.
[00:08:54] Candy Crush.
[00:08:55] No, Candy Land.
[00:08:56] I forget.
[00:08:57] There's another game, Candy Land.
[00:08:59] That was like up there with shoots and ladders when I was a kid.
[00:09:02] So you could take that definition, this sort of frivolous game that you play for fun, but
[00:09:09] there's some definition of game that means you've got a competition based on rules where
[00:09:19] you're trying to score points or earn value in order to beat an opponent.
[00:09:29] That's a game, which again, that's what combat combat is the most serious of games.
[00:09:34] And that's what it is.
[00:09:35] It's a game.
[00:09:36] There's rules.
[00:09:37] We're trying to maneuver.
[00:09:38] We're trying to move the rules while we beat the opponent.
[00:09:40] It's competition.
[00:09:43] And if you think about life, it's similar because in life, guess what?
[00:09:47] There's rules.
[00:09:51] And you can break some of the rules of life.
[00:09:53] There could be consequences.
[00:09:54] You can actually choose different.
[00:09:55] You can have different rules in your life than I have in my life.
[00:09:57] We could have different rules.
[00:09:59] So you actually have some say in the set of rules that you're going to go by.
[00:10:05] You get somebody with no morals, these people that rip off billions of dollars from other
[00:10:14] people that guys operating by a different set of rules than a normal person and should
[00:10:19] be punished severely for those actions.
[00:10:21] But that's what he was falling the rules that he thought or maybe he was breaking them.
[00:10:27] But there's rules.
[00:10:29] That's what's happening in life.
[00:10:30] You've got rules that you're following.
[00:10:32] You have goals that you're trying to achieve.
[00:10:35] So you're trying to score goals or earn points.
[00:10:39] That's happening.
[00:10:42] Most likely you're going to have to compete with others to achieve your goal.
[00:10:46] Most likely.
[00:10:48] Whether you're a caveman and we're trying to survive and you're trying to eat, we just
[00:10:52] killed a damn woolly mammoth and now we got to fight over who gets more meat.
[00:10:58] There's limited resources or you're running a business, I'm running a business.
[00:11:01] We're making widgets.
[00:11:02] I'm making widgets.
[00:11:03] We got to compete.
[00:11:06] So when I'm talking about the game of life or really these sub games, these subordinate
[00:11:14] games in life, don't think of the lowest definition.
[00:11:17] So if you're already mad, someone's mad at me, life isn't a game.
[00:11:20] They deleted the podcast, right?
[00:11:22] Life is not a game.
[00:11:24] Oh, but it is.
[00:11:27] But don't think of that low kind of base definition.
[00:11:30] Think of the straightforward definition, a competition executed according to rules where
[00:11:36] the goal is to achieve some kind of victory.
[00:11:39] And by the way, the victory is also defined by rules, right?
[00:11:45] Because for some reason they make a field goal worth this many points and a touchdown
[00:11:50] worth that many points.
[00:11:52] Those are just, they just made that up.
[00:11:55] So depending on what rules you put in your life, you winning might look different for
[00:12:00] you and to me.
[00:12:02] And that's okay.
[00:12:03] That's the thing, we're not disparaging the set of rules you're playing or the goals
[00:12:06] that you have or the goals that I'm playing or the rules that I'm playing or the goals
[00:12:09] that I have.
[00:12:10] I'm not disparaging those things.
[00:12:12] They might just might be different.
[00:12:14] What we have to watch out for is you have to make sure that you do know the rules that
[00:12:18] you're going to play by.
[00:12:19] You have to make sure you know what you're trying to achieve.
[00:12:22] What does victory look like for you?
[00:12:26] So that's, that's what's happening.
[00:12:31] Now during this conversation that I had with this friend of mine, he eventually got that
[00:12:38] look on his face that he understood that, okay, I get it.
[00:12:42] I'm playing a game.
[00:12:44] I'm in a game.
[00:12:46] He understood it, but he don't, he just kind of like realized it.
[00:12:50] And then he started asking me questions like, what are the rules of the game?
[00:12:55] How do you win the game?
[00:12:57] Where do you focus?
[00:13:00] Do you ever walk away?
[00:13:02] Can you surrender?
[00:13:03] Is it a marathon?
[00:13:04] Is it a sprint?
[00:13:05] Like he started asking me detailed questions about the game.
[00:13:11] And I've been thinking for a while about these things.
[00:13:14] I'm going to spend some time addressing these on maybe a podcast or two, maybe seven podcasts,
[00:13:20] maybe 12 podcasts.
[00:13:21] I don't know.
[00:13:22] But let's start with this.
[00:13:29] How do you know you're in a game?
[00:13:31] How do you know?
[00:13:32] Well, the short answer is you are.
[00:13:34] You absolutely are in a game.
[00:13:37] And in order to see that, you have to take a step back and look at this.
[00:13:40] And to get here, what I recommend, I recommend this often as a tool for detachment.
[00:13:47] And that is to take a step back and actually write things down.
[00:13:51] Actually put pen to paper.
[00:13:54] If you don't know that you're in a game right now, take a step back, sit down and write
[00:13:59] down, ask yourself some good questions.
[00:14:03] What are my objectives?
[00:14:06] But if you're looking at your life or you're looking at your relationship or you're looking
[00:14:11] at your job, you need to take a step back and say, what are my objectives?
[00:14:15] Because if you don't know what your objectives are, you definitely don't know you're in a
[00:14:20] game.
[00:14:21] Imagine you're walking around a piece of grass and all of a sudden people go running
[00:14:24] by you and one of them is holding a ball.
[00:14:26] Like, you don't know what they're doing.
[00:14:28] Right?
[00:14:29] Maybe you should grab that dude and put him to the ground.
[00:14:31] But you don't even know what he's doing.
[00:14:33] You don't know what direction he's going.
[00:14:34] There's big, there's lines on the grass.
[00:14:37] There's numbers around 10, 20, 30, 40.
[00:14:41] Right?
[00:14:42] You don't know what they mean.
[00:14:44] So write down, okay, what?
[00:14:47] Okay, I get it.
[00:14:48] I'm trying to get this ball into that area of grass that's painted red.
[00:14:54] Okay.
[00:14:55] Think of how your whole world improves.
[00:15:01] If you're standing on a piece of grass, you have no idea what's going on.
[00:15:03] People are running around.
[00:15:04] They're kicking things.
[00:15:05] They're throwing things.
[00:15:06] And you don't know what's happening.
[00:15:08] But as soon as you go, oh, I'm trying to, these guys with the red shirts on are going
[00:15:12] against the guys with the white shirts on.
[00:15:15] And we're trying to get this ball into that red area.
[00:15:19] Okay.
[00:15:20] Think of how much more productive you can be in that scenario.
[00:15:26] Just knowing that.
[00:15:27] Just knowing that.
[00:15:28] So how many people are sitting there on the field of life and they don't even know what
[00:15:33] direction they're going.
[00:15:34] They don't know what the objective is.
[00:15:35] They don't know what their objective is.
[00:15:37] So the first step you take is you actually write down, okay, here's what I'm trying,
[00:15:44] here's where I'm trying to go.
[00:15:45] Here's what I'm trying to do.
[00:15:46] This is my objective.
[00:15:49] And then you try and figure out, okay, what are the rules here?
[00:15:50] Like, what are some of the rules you have to obey?
[00:15:54] Because there's rules.
[00:15:55] There's societal rules.
[00:15:57] There's religious rules.
[00:15:58] There's family rules.
[00:15:59] There's rules that are in place that you, you can't just, if the goal is to get money,
[00:16:05] well, you can't just steal it.
[00:16:07] You can try, but you get caught.
[00:16:08] There's going to be consequences.
[00:16:10] You can't, you know, you have relationships with your family.
[00:16:14] You need to protect those relationships with your family in most cases.
[00:16:18] Those are rules that you write down.
[00:16:22] Then you start figuring out, okay, what strategies can I use?
[00:16:25] What tactics can I use?
[00:16:27] Now that I know what my objective is, what should I actually be doing tactically on a
[00:16:33] day to day, week to week basis to try and progress towards this goal that I just figured
[00:16:38] out I had and then write those things down.
[00:16:45] And I think what you will see as you start to write down these objectives and these rules
[00:16:53] and these strategies and these tactics, I think what you'll start to realize is that
[00:16:57] you'll start to see, oh, there's a couple of different games going on here.
[00:17:01] Probably a real obvious one is work.
[00:17:05] It's also an obvious one because a lot of times you can see what your objective is.
[00:17:10] Oh, I want to get paid.
[00:17:12] I want to get promoted.
[00:17:14] I want to move into a leadership position or I want to grow this, but you know, what
[00:17:18] something like that.
[00:17:19] So that generally speaking, work is a little bit more identifiable.
[00:17:24] Not always because you talk to some people, you know, we go into companies that are on
[00:17:28] front, oh, what are your goals?
[00:17:31] You know, talk to a front line manager.
[00:17:33] Oh, what are your goals here?
[00:17:37] Make good money this quarter.
[00:17:38] They don't have any long term goals.
[00:17:40] They're going to be strategic goals.
[00:17:41] Oh, what's the goal of the company?
[00:17:43] Oh, make money this quarter.
[00:17:45] So that means they're not thinking strategic.
[00:17:47] They're thinking tactical, but they at least will have some idea in most cases.
[00:17:52] I mean, imagine you were a bouncer.
[00:17:54] Sure.
[00:17:55] Right.
[00:17:56] Back in the day.
[00:17:58] Did you ever think to yourself, all right, what am I trying to do here?
[00:18:01] Yeah.
[00:18:02] I mean, there was a point where it hit me really hard and I started thinking that I was gone
[00:18:06] soon after that.
[00:18:07] Yeah.
[00:18:08] Because you start thinking, wait a second, what?
[00:18:10] Like if I win this game, what do I get?
[00:18:16] What do I put into it and what do I get?
[00:18:18] That's another thing to think about is like, what is not just what's the objective and
[00:18:23] what's the victory, but what do I get for that victory?
[00:18:26] Because a paycheck on Sunday and a wasted Friday, a wasted Saturday, you know, the hanging
[00:18:35] around scene, you shouldn't really, it's not really progressing your life.
[00:18:39] You start realizing, oh, this, what am I doing here?
[00:18:42] So you actually had that revelation.
[00:18:43] Yes.
[00:18:44] Yeah.
[00:18:45] How long did it take you to make the decision to bail?
[00:18:48] Well, actually it's funny because even right when you just said bouncer, it hit me so clearly
[00:18:55] remembering that experience.
[00:18:56] In hindsight.
[00:18:57] Yeah.
[00:18:58] Inside I was like, damn, but it did hit me.
[00:19:00] So at first, yeah, you're like just floating.
[00:19:03] You're like the game, if you even recognize which I did it because I just needed a job,
[00:19:07] I had experience so it's easy to get.
[00:19:09] So I got it.
[00:19:11] And then it was just good fun.
[00:19:12] So it was literally just moment to moment, day to day.
[00:19:15] So short term gratification, like daily basis, like literally nightly, literally nightly.
[00:19:23] And that went on, you know, early twenties, who cares, you know, kind of a thing.
[00:19:26] As far as how it went for me anyway.
[00:19:29] And then yeah, once I hit mid twenties, that's when it started to hit me.
[00:19:32] Whoa, like I've been here like two years, years.
[00:19:35] And what do you have to show for it?
[00:19:38] Nothing, same spot, but which was fine because it's still fun.
[00:19:41] I'm still young, all this stuff.
[00:19:43] But you know, when you hit 25 ish, you're kind of like, oh, you see older people in
[00:19:48] that scene.
[00:19:49] Oh, that person's like kind of older, cool, fine, but I didn't feel that that's where
[00:19:54] I wanted to be kind of a thing.
[00:19:55] All that stuff started to creep in my mind or whatever.
[00:19:59] And then yeah, you start to realize like, okay, I should, I should at least pay attention
[00:20:03] to the future, like long, medium, whatever future.
[00:20:07] And then I, but I had been not paying attention for so long that I wasn't even looking outside
[00:20:11] of my like trajectory, you know.
[00:20:14] So I started making goals within that same trajectory.
[00:20:16] I can maybe I'll be a manager, maybe I'll gain some skills here and bro, they were all
[00:20:20] about it.
[00:20:21] The all my superiors, they're all about it.
[00:20:24] They're like, oh yeah, cool.
[00:20:25] And then so I started to kind of pursue that a little bit.
[00:20:28] And then after a while, I was like, with you about your career.
[00:20:30] I'm like, Hey, because they got you there.
[00:20:32] They think, oh, yeah, we got him.
[00:20:34] Yep.
[00:20:35] It fully did.
[00:20:36] Like, oh yeah.
[00:20:37] And just the kind of guy we need.
[00:20:38] Yep.
[00:20:39] Yeah.
[00:20:40] Essentially, you know, you know what that manager paycheck looks like.
[00:20:44] This is such a perfect thing.
[00:20:45] This is exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:20:47] This is exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:20:49] And you had a little moment.
[00:20:51] This happens to a lot of people, you know, you see, you see the person that's doing
[00:20:54] what you're doing, but they're 10 years older than you.
[00:20:57] And you think, wait a second, you have a moment of clarity where you go, wait a second.
[00:21:03] That some people have a moment of clarity.
[00:21:06] Well, wait a second, that's going to be me.
[00:21:07] Some people say, Oh no, that'll never happen to me.
[00:21:11] But in order for it to not happen, you got to get, you got to, you got to make some
[00:21:14] adjustments.
[00:21:15] So this is exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:21:18] Like this is exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:21:21] From the work perspective, you're in a work job, you're doing your job and you're looking
[00:21:26] and you start realizing, okay, what is this game that I'm playing?
[00:21:28] Because you're, you are on the field, but there's plays happening.
[00:21:32] There's things going on.
[00:21:33] You don't even know what's, you don't know what's happening.
[00:21:36] So that's a good step to take.
[00:21:39] Now here's another one.
[00:21:40] Here's another game that you're in, whether you want to be in it or not.
[00:21:43] And you should know you're in health.
[00:21:45] Yeah.
[00:21:46] Health is a game that you're in.
[00:21:50] And if you don't recognize that you're in this game, again, that's when you look at
[00:21:54] somebody that's 10 years older than you and they're not in good physical condition.
[00:21:58] They're having health problems.
[00:22:00] They look terrible.
[00:22:01] They feel terrible.
[00:22:03] And did they, did they 10 years prior say, you know what I really want to do?
[00:22:07] I really want to put on 48 pounds of, you know, fat.
[00:22:11] I want, I want my heart rate to go catastrophic.
[00:22:15] I want to just look like crap and feel like crap.
[00:22:19] There's zero people say that.
[00:22:21] And yet there they are.
[00:22:22] Why?
[00:22:23] They didn't realize that they were in a game.
[00:22:24] They didn't realize that there's rules to that game.
[00:22:26] Like, here's the rules.
[00:22:28] There's rules you got to follow.
[00:22:29] If you don't follow them, you break those rules, you're going to look up and you won't
[00:22:33] be, you won't have achieved your objective.
[00:22:37] And if you don't know that there's an objective, you better start paying attention to this
[00:22:40] podcast right now at this moment in time.
[00:22:47] Relationships, right?
[00:22:48] And this is another one.
[00:22:49] I was talking about this with my daughter because when you say, oh, it's a relationship.
[00:22:54] It's a game, total negative connotation, right?
[00:22:57] But what if I said, hey, you know, I got a relationship with Echo Charles.
[00:23:00] He's a friend of mine.
[00:23:01] It's a game.
[00:23:02] Here's what I'm trying to do.
[00:23:03] Trying to build a good relationship, trying to build trust.
[00:23:05] Like all those things are positive.
[00:23:08] And yet it's a game because you got maneuvers you got to make.
[00:23:11] You got to follow certain rules in order to build that trust, in order to build that respect.
[00:23:16] So all those things are going on.
[00:23:18] And then you've got life and you've got, you know, legacy and whatnot.
[00:23:25] And I think, so we got these categories.
[00:23:29] And what are your pillars?
[00:23:30] You got your pillars.
[00:23:31] What are your pillars?
[00:23:32] What are they?
[00:23:33] Pillars?
[00:23:34] There's eight of them?
[00:23:35] I thought there was five.
[00:23:36] What are your pillars?
[00:23:37] They're partners.
[00:23:38] They're like partners.
[00:23:40] Okay.
[00:23:41] Health and physical capability are two.
[00:23:45] So and then so health physically, your income and what you do with your time.
[00:23:52] So they can, their partners as well.
[00:23:54] Interesting.
[00:23:55] Interesting.
[00:23:56] Oh, your spirituality and your worldview.
[00:23:58] That's another two.
[00:24:00] And then your relationships, friendly and romantic.
[00:24:03] Okay.
[00:24:05] These are, you know, these are things that if you broke those down, health is a game,
[00:24:10] income is a game, spirituality, I'm not sure how we pin that one down.
[00:24:13] I'm not sure what you mean by that.
[00:24:14] Your place in the world.
[00:24:16] Okay.
[00:24:17] So it's game.
[00:24:18] Understanding your place in the world.
[00:24:19] Yeah.
[00:24:20] Yeah.
[00:24:21] And where you're going in the world.
[00:24:22] Yeah.
[00:24:23] To me, more importantly, like, Hey, where am I going in the world?
[00:24:25] Yeah.
[00:24:26] Well, I've always thought of it in this way where, you know, because a lot of times,
[00:24:30] spirituality, that's another just, I mean, just you asking that really, that's really
[00:24:34] indicative of how I think a lot of people kind of regard spiritual.
[00:24:37] It has different meanings for different people.
[00:24:39] So I thought about that.
[00:24:40] And I think just understanding your place in the world, you know how like, if you look
[00:24:43] at the world, just all of existence that you understand as one big puzzle, like, where
[00:24:47] are you in that puzzle?
[00:24:48] You know, that little piece, because you fit to the pieces next to you somehow.
[00:24:53] And so how do you fit and how does that puzzle kind of form as a whole, you know, compared
[00:24:58] to where you are in it?
[00:25:00] So it's just like, like that, like your place in the world.
[00:25:03] Yes.
[00:25:04] But a lot, that's sort of like saying, I know what my place is on the field.
[00:25:08] Yeah.
[00:25:09] But you got to know what's happening on the field.
[00:25:10] Like you got to understand what's going on.
[00:25:12] What's the importance of it?
[00:25:13] And yeah, yeah, fully, you're right.
[00:25:15] So when I say, when I was talking about right taking a moment to write these things down,
[00:25:20] to me, it's sort of like what happens when people say, I'm going to write down my New
[00:25:24] Year's resolution, write down my goals.
[00:25:26] Like, you know, you know, a lot of people, they'll say, Oh, if you got to write down
[00:25:29] your goals in order for them to come true, there's, that's, that's a good tactic.
[00:25:33] And what, when you do that, you're actually writing down a goal.
[00:25:39] You're sort of, you're sort of clarifying the game.
[00:25:41] You're clarifying the objective of the game.
[00:25:43] So that's when you write down your New Year's resolution, you're saying, okay, I'm entering
[00:25:47] this game.
[00:25:48] And for that alone can help you saying, Oh, there's a game going on here.
[00:25:53] I eat junk food every night.
[00:25:56] And if I keep eating junk food, I'm going to lose this game of health.
[00:26:00] So writing it down and saying, Okay, I want to lose weight.
[00:26:04] I want to be more healthy.
[00:26:07] Here's the rules I got to follow.
[00:26:08] And then all of a sudden you've defined the game and now you can start to make progress.
[00:26:11] Whereas if you don't do that, you know what the hell's going on in your life.
[00:26:15] So what games are you are you in?
[00:26:18] Are we in?
[00:26:19] Well, as you mentioned, like job, work, income, what are the rules there?
[00:26:27] Well, you're going to have, you got to earn money, right?
[00:26:30] You want to get promoted possibly.
[00:26:32] Not everyone wants to get promoted, get, learn some kind of a skill.
[00:26:36] There's a, there's a positive benefit to learning some kind of a skill that gives you some kind
[00:26:40] of job security.
[00:26:42] And then what are the rules inside that game?
[00:26:45] You got some rules like there's actual rules beyond time for work, right?
[00:26:49] These are actual rules, but there's a uniform you got to wear.
[00:26:53] There's a treatment of others.
[00:26:54] You can't use this word or whatever.
[00:26:56] The HR will come and get you.
[00:26:58] Right?
[00:27:01] And then you've got the job itself and the tasks that you've got to complete and the
[00:27:06] skills that you've got to learn and the projects that you've got to complete.
[00:27:12] And then you've got the game that's going on at work because if you build good relationships
[00:27:18] with people, the right people, you can support each other.
[00:27:22] And if you're, hey, does that make you an ass kisser?
[00:27:25] If you build a good relationship with your boss and you take care of your boss and make
[00:27:28] your boss look good.
[00:27:29] No, no, actually you're doing a good job and your boss will then most likely take care
[00:27:33] of you.
[00:27:34] Yeah.
[00:27:35] Your, your relation and you brought that up really early where it's like, um, ass kisser,
[00:27:39] right?
[00:27:40] Like brown nose or whatever.
[00:27:41] Like that, just that idea when you say forming a good relationship up the chain.
[00:27:44] So you put it in and I'm like, wait a second, like you got to, there's a difference between
[00:27:48] being a brown noser and building a good relationship.
[00:27:51] So don't think of it as this is what I'm saying in my head, right?
[00:27:55] To gain a better understanding of what you're saying.
[00:27:57] So building a relationship with someone is just when it's up the chain, down the chain,
[00:28:01] your neighbor, your wife, your kids, whatever, it's, it's all essentially the same.
[00:28:06] You do it in different ways.
[00:28:07] I mean, different people, different ways, but it's essentially the same approach where
[00:28:09] it's like you're, you want to build an actual relationship.
[00:28:13] 100%.
[00:28:14] You're not trying to make them some, you're not trying to please them at every moment
[00:28:17] necessarily.
[00:28:18] You're trying to build a two way street, good relationship like anything.
[00:28:23] So yeah, no one, I don't even think brown nosing is building a good relationship.
[00:28:28] Yeah.
[00:28:29] Yeah.
[00:28:30] Well, there's some people that are, some people that are susceptible, they like to get brown
[00:28:33] nosed, right?
[00:28:35] But what's funny is like, let's say you're a big brown noser with me and I was the big
[00:28:38] boss man.
[00:28:39] I actually know you're a brown noser.
[00:28:41] I go, I guess he's a brown nose.
[00:28:42] He's just trying to kiss my ass.
[00:28:43] Exactly right.
[00:28:44] And actually you started to say that and I went kind of deep one in a few days anyway,
[00:28:48] thinking about that.
[00:28:49] Cause I know some brown nosers and some of them are like, man, that guy's so nice.
[00:28:52] He's so nice to everybody, but at the same time, like the real, you know, cause the
[00:28:56] purpose of building a relationship is to have like, intent has a smell.
[00:29:00] So Brad, you don't trust them that much.
[00:29:01] You like them.
[00:29:02] And then, you know, you'd go into stuff where, um, what's the expression that a good neighbor
[00:29:06] or a good Barbie, I don't know, seal teams.
[00:29:09] Yeah.
[00:29:10] Like it's like that, that like you like them.
[00:29:12] Totally like them.
[00:29:13] You never do anything mean to this guy.
[00:29:14] So nice.
[00:29:15] But is that the relationship you want to do?
[00:29:18] And that's what I felt about like brown noses or whatever, no matter how nice they are.
[00:29:22] So I don't think that's an effective way to build a relationship.
[00:29:26] Yeah.
[00:29:28] This one of the earlier, I think this was a couple of years ago now, but it's worth
[00:29:35] reiterating.
[00:29:39] Is this the game you want to play when it comes to work?
[00:29:41] Is this the game you want to play?
[00:29:43] Because you spend a lot of time with your job and if you hate it, that's not healthy.
[00:29:50] You should be playing a game when it comes to work that you like to play.
[00:29:56] Right.
[00:29:57] So if you like pouring concrete, then that's great.
[00:30:01] And you're, and you pour concrete for it.
[00:30:02] I mean, think of how awesome that is.
[00:30:05] If you like software engineering and you're a software engineer, I mean, it's, hey, if
[00:30:11] you like being in the SEAL teams, I was in the SEAL teams.
[00:30:14] I love being in the SEAL teams.
[00:30:15] What a freaking great job.
[00:30:16] I didn't, I never went to work a day in my life.
[00:30:19] So, do you want to actually play this game?
[00:30:23] Is something you should assess?
[00:30:26] And by the way, we're going to get this on all aspects of this, right?
[00:30:29] Because you're going to be in relationship games.
[00:30:31] Do you want to be in that relationship game?
[00:30:32] You're going to be in life games that do you want to be playing that particular field?
[00:30:40] But for work is what you're doing gratifying.
[00:30:44] Is it gratifying to you?
[00:30:45] Do you get done with a day and say, damn, that was a good day.
[00:30:48] I really got a lot of, I made progress.
[00:30:50] I made the world a little bit better today.
[00:30:52] I made my world a little bit better.
[00:30:54] I made my clients world a little bit better.
[00:30:56] I made the highway a little bit better, pouring concrete.
[00:30:59] Like, what are you doing?
[00:31:01] Are you proud of it?
[00:31:04] And then, and this is the thing that came up a couple of years ago, does this game score
[00:31:11] the way you want it to score?
[00:31:13] And what came up with, I had two friends that were both working two extremely capable friends,
[00:31:21] meaning extremely smart, charismatic, you know, just good, really good, both of them
[00:31:28] were men, really good guys, both extremely hard workers.
[00:31:33] These are 70, 80 hour a week people, 100 hour a week, whatever is needed.
[00:31:38] And they were both capped out from a financial income perspective, meaning they were making
[00:31:47] as much money as they could make playing that game.
[00:31:52] And the way I explained it to both of them, luckily I had the two conversations within
[00:31:55] a couple of weeks of each other, but it's like you could be the best soccer player in
[00:32:01] the world and how many soccer goals could you score a game?
[00:32:06] Maybe one, maybe two.
[00:32:08] Maybe, but if you're a basketball player, you might be scoring 30, 40, 50 points a game.
[00:32:13] Well, there's some jobs that you work an 80 hour week and you make $64,000 a year.
[00:32:22] Those jobs exist for real.
[00:32:24] There's jobs that work, you work 20 hours a week and you make $500,000 a year.
[00:32:30] So if you work 100 hours a week, you're going to make, you know, multiples more than that.
[00:32:35] So figure out if the game that you're in from a job perspective, write it down.
[00:32:43] Is this the game I want to be in?
[00:32:45] What are the objectives?
[00:32:46] How many points can I score?
[00:32:48] Is it worth my time?
[00:32:50] Like Echo is sitting around as a bouncer at 23 years old.
[00:32:52] It's like, okay, hey, this is fun.
[00:32:54] But as soon as you take a step back and say, wait, is this gratifying?
[00:32:59] Wait a second, how much money can I make?
[00:33:01] And part of the way we're keeping score is money.
[00:33:04] So if I can't make a ton of money and I can't really progress, what am I doing on the field
[00:33:09] right now?
[00:33:10] Why am I playing this game?
[00:33:12] So when it comes to work, ask yourself that question.
[00:33:17] Ask yourself all these questions.
[00:33:19] Is this the game you want to play from an employment, from a job, from an entrepreneurial
[00:33:24] perspective?
[00:33:25] Is this the game you want to play?
[00:33:27] Now we're talking about health, which is what's interesting about health is you don't have
[00:33:34] to follow any of the rules.
[00:33:36] No one's going to enforce the rules on you.
[00:33:38] I mean, you can get addicted to heroin and you can literally do heroin until you die.
[00:33:42] That's, that's, you can do that.
[00:33:47] But there are rules that we know you can follow.
[00:33:50] You know, you can follow good, healthy diet.
[00:33:52] You can follow exercise.
[00:33:55] You can do the proper amount of rest and recovery.
[00:33:59] And if you don't know that you're playing a game there, you're going to have problems.
[00:34:05] Relationships.
[00:34:07] So at Eshalon Front, last couple of years, I've been talking a lot about relationships
[00:34:12] and what a relationship is.
[00:34:13] And what a relationship is to me is trust, listen, respect and influence.
[00:34:17] Meaning, if you and I don't trust each other, there's no relationship.
[00:34:22] If you and I don't listen to each other, there's no relationship.
[00:34:25] If you and I don't respect each other, there's no relationship.
[00:34:27] If you and I have no influence over each other, there's no relationship.
[00:34:30] But if we do trust each other, if we do listen to each other, if we do respect each other,
[00:34:33] if we do influence each other, then we got a relationship.
[00:34:36] And obviously there's a whole bunch of shades of gray in their different gradients of how
[00:34:42] strong our relationship is.
[00:34:44] But that's what, that's what we're dealing with.
[00:34:47] So you got friends.
[00:34:53] You want to have, you want to build friendships.
[00:34:57] You want to build good relationship friendships.
[00:35:01] You know, there's a, I think the movie is called The Town where the dude comes in and
[00:35:05] he's like, hey, we're going to go somewhere.
[00:35:07] We're going to hurt some people and we can never talk about it again.
[00:35:10] And the dude looks back at him and says, who's car we taking?
[00:35:13] You kind of want some friends like that, right?
[00:35:15] That's the kind of friends you want.
[00:35:17] You also want to have a friend that's like, hey, bro, is this a good move that we're
[00:35:21] about to make?
[00:35:22] Is it worth the risk?
[00:35:23] What are we doing it for?
[00:35:24] Is this your ego?
[00:35:25] Are you just emotional right now?
[00:35:26] You see what I'm saying?
[00:35:27] You want to have somebody that's going to push back against your, your, your, what you consider
[00:35:31] to be your good ideas.
[00:35:33] You want to make sure that your friends really want the best for you.
[00:35:43] They like it when you win.
[00:35:44] They love it when you win.
[00:35:46] They like it more when you win than when they win, right?
[00:35:49] That's always nice.
[00:35:52] It's always nice when you've got a friend that says, oh, you're winning and they're
[00:35:55] happy.
[00:35:57] It's so bizarre that you can have friends that when you win, they don't like it.
[00:36:02] Bro, it's spooky.
[00:36:05] And it's not just friends too.
[00:36:07] Like, you know, if you come across a family scenario where, you know, it's revealed to
[00:36:11] you that, you know, maybe they're not as supportive, you know, yeah, it's, uh, it's bizarre for
[00:36:18] sure, but it's like kind of spooky because, you know, like someone's your friend and maybe,
[00:36:22] you know, in under certain circumstance, like you've only been through so many things with
[00:36:27] them a lot for sure.
[00:36:29] But let's say there's certain circumstances you haven't been in with them, then they get
[00:36:32] revealed to be, you know, like an easy one, an easy one.
[00:36:36] Like if something good happens to you, like big major life thing, you know, and then you
[00:36:42] could tell they're not happy.
[00:36:43] Like, damn this whole fucking time you've been feeling that way.
[00:36:47] You know, like, bro, it's bad, man.
[00:36:50] Yeah.
[00:36:51] I mean, you know, when, when I got my house and Stoner came up, like I had a couple of
[00:36:56] friends come over when I first got my house and the house where I live now.
[00:37:02] And it's, it's, it's in an optimal spot.
[00:37:05] Let's say, right?
[00:37:06] I would agree with that.
[00:37:07] It's an optimal position geographically on earth.
[00:37:11] Hell yeah.
[00:37:12] And like the first guy that came over was like, Oh, I forget what the little criticism
[00:37:18] he made, but it was some devastating in his mind.
[00:37:21] You know, oh, this salt water is going to eat everything.
[00:37:26] You know, like that was like for him, bro, I'd be like, how could you even live here?
[00:37:32] The salt spray from the ocean is going to really damage your whole life.
[00:37:36] Yeah.
[00:37:37] Your whole life.
[00:37:38] I'm like, bro, you know, I'll rotate some gear out.
[00:37:39] I think I'll be all right.
[00:37:41] But that, and I saw, I had several people hit me with that negativity.
[00:37:46] When I came over like he showed up, he's like, bro, we are so, he's calling it weed.
[00:37:52] We got this.
[00:37:53] Right?
[00:37:54] We kind of, we kind of actually, but, but what a crazy thing to think about.
[00:37:59] So when we talk about these relationships as being a game, well, if you got a friend
[00:38:05] that doesn't want you to win, you're not winning the game.
[00:38:07] Yeah.
[00:38:08] If you've got friends that are supportive of you or doing everything they're going to
[00:38:11] help you, you got, you're winning the game.
[00:38:16] Same thing with your, you know, your, your relationship, whether it's a spouse, whether
[00:38:21] it's a girlfriend, boyfriend type scenario.
[00:38:24] This is sort of your business partner in life, in, in, in a lot of aspects of your life.
[00:38:31] So what kind of trust, what kind of, you know, respect do you have for each other?
[00:38:36] How much do you influence each other?
[00:38:37] How much do you listen to each other?
[00:38:40] Where are you at?
[00:38:41] Cause if you got a spouse that you don't respect, you're not winning the game.
[00:38:45] If they don't respect you, you're not winning, if they don't listen to you, they're not
[00:38:47] winning the game.
[00:38:48] If you don't listen to them, like those are all things.
[00:38:49] So if you don't understand that, if you don't understand that that's part of the game that
[00:38:54] you're playing, you're going to lose the game.
[00:38:56] You're going to lose the game.
[00:38:58] We got kids, right?
[00:39:00] You start having kids.
[00:39:03] That's part of the scenario too.
[00:39:07] And so then there's, there's influences that you have on your kids and what influences
[00:39:12] are you having on them?
[00:39:14] And are they negative or are they positive?
[00:39:17] And if you don't understand, if you're not paying attention to that, if you're not watching
[00:39:21] it, all of a sudden you look up and you've made some major mistakes and you got a kid
[00:39:27] running off the rails over here.
[00:39:33] So when it comes to this relational aspect thing of friends, of spouses, of girlfriends,
[00:39:38] of boyfriends, of kids, by the way, kids, same thing.
[00:39:42] You want them to listen to you?
[00:39:43] Listen to them.
[00:39:44] You want them to trust you?
[00:39:45] You have to trust them.
[00:39:46] You want them to treat you with respect?
[00:39:47] You better treat them with respect.
[00:39:51] To cast all this away by saying like, you know, the classic expression, I'm sure you've
[00:39:57] said it to a bunch of young ladies in your day.
[00:40:00] Stop playing games with me.
[00:40:02] No, I'll put it in the back.
[00:40:04] But you know, you know the, that's, that's like a common phrase, you know, like a really
[00:40:09] negative like, oh, stop playing games with me.
[00:40:13] And if you view this idea of playing a game with relationships, just from the fact that
[00:40:19] you like playing a game and manipulating, of course it's a negative connotation.
[00:40:22] But if you look at the game is to build bonds.
[00:40:25] If you look at the game is to build trust.
[00:40:27] If you look at the game to build a true partner in life, then it's a positive thing.
[00:40:33] Yeah.
[00:40:34] Yeah, the, you bring that up where the courting phase in a relationship, right?
[00:40:42] Being in that part, the courting part of it, it's like, there's that big game that you're
[00:40:46] talking about, but then there's a couple of, maybe two levels of psychological game within
[00:40:51] the game.
[00:40:52] So, and there are rules just, and there are like ways to score and all this other stuff.
[00:40:56] Like, and it kind of is like an actual game in that way.
[00:41:00] Yes.
[00:41:01] But it is for the good.
[00:41:02] It's for the greater good.
[00:41:03] And that's what you have to look at.
[00:41:05] Is your end goal to manipulate some of the person?
[00:41:09] Right.
[00:41:10] Then it's, then you're playing the wrong game.
[00:41:11] Yeah.
[00:41:12] Hey, I can say that, that ultimately you may get a short term gratification, but ultimately
[00:41:19] you're playing the wrong game.
[00:41:21] If your goal is to manipulate someone, take advantage of them.
[00:41:24] Listen, you might win a short term game.
[00:41:25] Oh, I got this girl to do this for me.
[00:41:28] Yeah.
[00:41:29] Where you're going to be long term.
[00:41:30] Yeah.
[00:41:31] That's why you have to take a step back and write down what it is you're trying to achieve.
[00:41:33] Because you go through a bunch of hollow relationships like that.
[00:41:37] You haven't progressed in life.
[00:41:38] Yeah.
[00:41:39] And you end up with a bunch of baggage.
[00:41:40] Yeah.
[00:41:41] And that's not going to help you.
[00:41:44] We're playing a game, not a manipulation.
[00:41:47] That's not what we're talking about.
[00:41:48] Like there's a, there's like a famous book that's called The Game, right?
[00:41:51] Yeah.
[00:41:52] It's like a pickup artist book.
[00:41:53] Oh, for real.
[00:41:54] And it's called The Game.
[00:41:55] Okay.
[00:41:56] And that's like one of those things.
[00:41:57] It's like, oh, if you say this, you act this way.
[00:41:59] It's like giving pointers to guys so they can go and manipulate girls into basically,
[00:42:06] you know, sleeping with them.
[00:42:07] Yeah.
[00:42:08] Yeah.
[00:42:09] I'm pretty sure.
[00:42:10] And that's what it is.
[00:42:12] So that's a, not what we're talking about.
[00:42:16] And look, that could be a game that you're playing when you're 23 years old.
[00:42:19] Yeah.
[00:42:20] Right?
[00:42:21] You could be playing that game.
[00:42:22] But if you're playing that game right now at 23 years old, take a step back and figure
[00:42:27] out where that's going to put you in the long run.
[00:42:30] That's what you need to figure out.
[00:42:32] Because there's a bigger, more superior game that you should be playing.
[00:42:38] And think about that.
[00:42:42] The other game that we're dealing with is, is everyone's dealing with is your mental
[00:42:50] health.
[00:42:54] Which in my opinion, it's kind of rooted in everything we just talked about, like physical
[00:42:58] health.
[00:42:59] Right?
[00:43:00] If you're not physically healthy, it's going to be harder for you to keep your mental health
[00:43:07] on peak, right?
[00:43:09] On point.
[00:43:11] Your job gratification, right?
[00:43:12] If you're miserable at work, what does that do to you for mental health?
[00:43:16] If you're, if you're miserable all day long, that's not beneficial to your mental health.
[00:43:21] If you are in bad relationships, that's not beneficial for your mental health.
[00:43:27] So all these things are impacting your mental health.
[00:43:32] One thing that I've noticed is that a big part from what I've seen, a big part of mental
[00:43:44] health and being a good place from a mental health perspective is taking ownership.
[00:43:54] And I've found that people who take ownership of their actions have better mental health.
[00:44:03] And obviously this falls into right in line with the book Extreme Ownership.
[00:44:13] But when I look, how many people have I met over the last 10 years?
[00:44:18] Or I guess when did Extreme Ownership came out in 2015?
[00:44:22] It's 2022 right now.
[00:44:24] So the past seven years, how many people have I met that have, for lack of a better phrase,
[00:44:31] turned their lives around from a mental health perspective by taking ownership of what's
[00:44:35] going on in their world?
[00:44:36] By saying, oh, because guess what?
[00:44:38] How do you get bad physical health?
[00:44:40] You don't take ownership of your health.
[00:44:42] You blame the work, you blame the time, you blame the this, you blame the, you just say,
[00:44:46] you know, how do you take ownership of your, how do you have bad satisfaction at work?
[00:44:51] Oh, you blame other people and you don't get promoted because you don't think that anyone
[00:44:55] likes you because it's all their fault.
[00:44:58] How do you end up in a bad relationship?
[00:44:59] Well, you go, oh, I ended up here and now I can't get out.
[00:45:02] It's like, no, people that take ownership of what's going on.
[00:45:06] And by the way, when you say, oh, yeah, you know, I got a DUI and I lost my license and
[00:45:10] that made me lose my job and my life sucks now.
[00:45:13] Okay.
[00:45:15] The person that goes, yep, you know what?
[00:45:16] I really screwed up.
[00:45:18] Here's what I did.
[00:45:19] I went, you know, I got a DUI and I lost my job.
[00:45:21] Here's what I'm doing now.
[00:45:23] That's my fault.
[00:45:24] Obviously I stopped drinking.
[00:45:25] I'm never drinking again.
[00:45:26] Here's my new job.
[00:45:27] It's low paying, but I know that there's a path for me to, you know, promote over time.
[00:45:33] Here's the way I'm getting around.
[00:45:34] I went and got an e-bike, you know, and now I can get to this new job I have.
[00:45:37] So people that take ownership of what's going on in their world are absolutely going to have,
[00:45:45] in my opinion, better mental health.
[00:45:48] And this is something that I've seen a lot of.
[00:45:53] And I've seen it help so many people.
[00:45:58] I've seen it help so many people to say, oh, yeah, I had this, you know, my mom got sick,
[00:46:03] my dad got sick, my kid got sick, my job got lost, like all those problems and going, okay,
[00:46:07] here's what I can do about it.
[00:46:08] Here's how I can fix it.
[00:46:09] Here's how I can move forward.
[00:46:12] And you know that, that one about the mom getting sick, about the dad getting sick, about the
[00:46:15] kid getting sick.
[00:46:16] And you take that, oh, well, now there's, I'm, you know, woe is me.
[00:46:21] And believe me, look, I've talked to countless people that have been in that situation.
[00:46:27] My kid got sick.
[00:46:28] I mean, I'm talking like bad diseases, cancer, like serious diseases.
[00:46:33] The ones that say, oh, yeah, this is what, this is what hit me.
[00:46:37] This is what hit my family.
[00:46:39] Here's how I went on offense.
[00:46:42] Here's what I did.
[00:46:43] And said, oh, I can't believe this happened to me.
[00:46:45] When people take ownership of how they respond to things, it helps their mental health so
[00:46:48] much just like taking action.
[00:46:51] Being on offense instead of being on defense is so much better for your mindset.
[00:46:57] And if you go through life, not taking ownership, being a victim of what's happening to you,
[00:47:03] it's much harder on your mental health than saying, okay, got dealt a bad hand.
[00:47:08] Here's what I'm going to do.
[00:47:09] Do you feel like it's like a control thing, like, you know how, and you say this where
[00:47:15] it's like the, the, the, the big motivator, if not the biggest motivator for people is
[00:47:19] controlling their own destiny.
[00:47:21] So is on a, like for lack of a term on a fundamental level, isn't that kind of what it comes down
[00:47:29] to like control?
[00:47:30] Like if something, if life is happening to someone, they feel they're not in control,
[00:47:35] all these bad things and they're not in control.
[00:47:36] If they were, they wouldn't happen, you know?
[00:47:38] But they're just essentially like missing the idea that you are in control of a bunch
[00:47:44] of things.
[00:47:45] You're kind of not in control of a bunch of things.
[00:47:48] For sure.
[00:47:49] There's things you can't control.
[00:47:50] Yeah.
[00:47:51] And then using the things you can't control to control the situation kind of thing.
[00:47:54] And usually there were just blier.
[00:47:57] And I'm trying to think of any situation where I was like unhappy or whatever.
[00:48:01] It's like, you're just more blind to it.
[00:48:03] It's not that they're not there.
[00:48:05] Like the elements you can control.
[00:48:06] You're just blind to the idea that, hey, you can control this whole thing.
[00:48:10] And then when you kind of go from there and this is kind of what I'm kind of hopefully
[00:48:14] kind of figuring out where that's where the ownership comes in.
[00:48:19] Yeah.
[00:48:20] For it's like, hey, this mistake, because you start, if you start blaming other people,
[00:48:24] you automatically kind of relinquish control of everything.
[00:48:26] Yes.
[00:48:27] Where it's like, hey, this thing messed up.
[00:48:29] It's not my fault.
[00:48:30] You know, like it's too bad.
[00:48:31] It's like, you know, out of my control, but now everything looking forward is not your
[00:48:33] control either.
[00:48:34] But if you look at it like the opposite way, you're kind of like, oh wait, I can control
[00:48:40] the outcome, you know, take ownership of how you respond to things for sure.
[00:48:45] So you get horrible news and you take ownership of how you respond to it.
[00:48:49] There are absolutely things in the world that you cannot control.
[00:48:53] There's absolutely things in the world that you cannot control.
[00:48:57] Absolutely.
[00:48:58] Of course.
[00:48:59] And then it's like, okay, how, what can I control?
[00:49:02] Let me focus on the things I can control and then move forward to the best of my ability
[00:49:07] and respond to whatever thing I can control in the best possible way.
[00:49:11] And if you don't do that, then you're just on defense and being on defense is like,
[00:49:18] you know, imagine you're a, imagine you're a mouse in a cage, in a, in a, let's say in
[00:49:24] a room and there's a cat in there.
[00:49:27] Well, let's say there's three of you mice and there's a cat in there.
[00:49:31] How do you feel?
[00:49:32] Like you're constantly scared.
[00:49:34] You're constantly reacting.
[00:49:36] You have no control.
[00:49:37] If you're the cat, you're kind of like good to go.
[00:49:40] Right?
[00:49:41] He's walking around, you know, like looking for food, looking for dinner.
[00:49:45] And so what are you going to do?
[00:49:47] You going to be the cat, you're going to be the mouse.
[00:49:48] You're going to be the predator, you're going to be the prey.
[00:49:52] And if you're a mouse and you're in that room, instead of going, well, this is horrible,
[00:49:56] why couldn't I be a big, you know, 12 pound animal with claws and teeth?
[00:50:01] And said, you're like, Hey, you know what?
[00:50:02] I can't be a big animal, but you know what I can do is dig a little hole through this
[00:50:07] wall, part of the wall, and I can have a place to hide.
[00:50:09] And that way this guy can't get me.
[00:50:11] And then good, I got control now.
[00:50:13] And by the way, inside this wall, we got some installation in there.
[00:50:16] We're going to build some nice beds and we're going to make a little life for us.
[00:50:19] You know what I'm saying?
[00:50:20] So there's a different attitude.
[00:50:22] When you take on, what can you control?
[00:50:24] Oh, I can burrow into this wall a little bit and I can actually get control inside behind
[00:50:29] this thing and I won't let this cat in here and we're good to go.
[00:50:32] Yeah.
[00:50:33] Man, that's, that hits me a lot when I get injured where, you know, when you first get
[00:50:37] injured, you're like, never did you get socks this whole time.
[00:50:41] I can't go train for high and you have to say, how long is it?
[00:50:43] Oh, freaking, you know, it's six, eight months or you're like, Oh my gosh, it's the end of
[00:50:46] the world.
[00:50:47] It's six, eight months is a long time, especially when it's not like you literally do not have
[00:50:51] the option to go train six, eight months.
[00:50:53] I've never been through that actually.
[00:50:55] Yeah.
[00:50:56] So, but I also think too, lifting like, bro, I can't lift like how, look, if I have a torn
[00:51:00] bicep toward ACL, torn, whatever, it's like, bro, I can never, I can't do squats anymore
[00:51:05] or bicep.
[00:51:06] I can, not only can I not do curls end of the world, by the way, I can't do shoulder
[00:51:11] break, I can't do bent.
[00:51:12] There's a lot that your biceps do, you know?
[00:51:14] So in your mind, you're like, I can't do any, like I can't lift.
[00:51:17] Why even like, what am I going to do?
[00:51:18] Do half jumping jack?
[00:51:19] Like it doesn't make sense.
[00:51:21] But if you for real think like, hey, no, anything regarding my bicep in any kind of intensity
[00:51:26] or whatever.
[00:51:27] Sure.
[00:51:28] We can't control that right now.
[00:51:29] It'll come back, but we can't control that right now.
[00:51:31] We're going to do literally everything else as hard as we can.
[00:51:34] Bro, you'd be surprised how much good stuff you can get.
[00:51:37] In fact, you said, you mentioned this.
[00:51:41] You probably don't know the impact it had on me.
[00:51:43] Maybe feel real good.
[00:51:44] But remember last time I tore my bicep, the second one, I was like, I forget exactly how
[00:51:49] I phrase it, but I was like, Hey, can you even tell that this is this has been torn?
[00:51:53] Because the first one, my whole arm was like a noodle.
[00:51:55] Cause I kind of, I didn't approach it the same way I approached this last one.
[00:51:59] But I was like, can you even tell you're like, you're like, oh yeah, I just figured you're
[00:52:03] you know, whatever.
[00:52:04] Like you made a joke first, but then you're like, no, actually I can't really tell at
[00:52:07] all.
[00:52:08] Aside from the bandage that I wore for the first week, like you're like, oh, I can't
[00:52:11] do this.
[00:52:12] After you had surgery, after I had surgery.
[00:52:13] Yeah.
[00:52:14] Yeah.
[00:52:15] Did you think you I could tell?
[00:52:16] I thought my arm was a noodle again, but then I still, I would say, you know, I'd see myself
[00:52:21] on video and stuff.
[00:52:22] I don't know, I can't even tell.
[00:52:24] And when you can't use the bicep at all for like six months, bro, it does a lot of like
[00:52:29] it shrinks a lot.
[00:52:31] But if you do like everything you can genuinely everything you can, bro, it's like minimal
[00:52:36] minimal, same thing.
[00:52:38] And that's like a good like what do you call it metaphor, whatever for how it can be, you
[00:52:42] know, you just be surprised how much you can still control.
[00:52:45] That's what I'm saying.
[00:52:46] The book super squats, you know, otherwise known as the Bible of lifting.
[00:52:51] But the funny thing is like, oh, how do you get, how do you get big arms?
[00:52:55] Squats.
[00:52:56] How do you get a big neck?
[00:52:58] Squats.
[00:52:59] How do you get big forearms?
[00:53:00] Squats.
[00:53:01] Like that's kind of the response.
[00:53:03] And sure.
[00:53:04] Oh yeah.
[00:53:05] But yes, it is a huge thing to think about how you can respond.
[00:53:10] And also we do have, there are obviously things we can't control, but we can usually control
[00:53:15] a lot more than we than we think.
[00:53:16] Yeah.
[00:53:17] And those might not be a lot more.
[00:53:20] That's going on in your world.
[00:53:21] You control a lot more than you think you can.
[00:53:24] And so keeping that in mind, this is part of the game of mental health.
[00:53:31] And what's scariest about mental health, I think, of all these is that I think it's
[00:53:36] the hardest one to track for yourself.
[00:53:39] Right.
[00:53:40] The hardest one to go, oh, I don't feel good about myself.
[00:53:45] I don't feel like I'm in a good spot.
[00:53:47] I think it's hard for people to track that.
[00:53:50] So it's worth once again, taking a step back and writing down like, okay, I got all these.
[00:53:56] I got my physical health.
[00:53:57] I got my job.
[00:53:58] How satisfying is my job?
[00:54:00] How satisfying are my relationships?
[00:54:03] Where am I at?
[00:54:04] How do I feel at the end of the day?
[00:54:08] What's my stress levels?
[00:54:11] So these are things to think about.
[00:54:15] And when you start talking about, when you start taking all these things, when you start
[00:54:19] taking a job and your work and your health and your fitness and your relationships that
[00:54:27] you're in, including friends, including family, then you add mental health and that you take
[00:54:37] all those things together and you get life.
[00:54:43] You get life.
[00:54:45] And that's the supreme game, right?
[00:54:48] That's the big game, the big game that we're playing.
[00:54:52] And obviously there are rules in life.
[00:54:55] And as I started off by saying, we have a lot of say over the rules of the game that we're
[00:55:03] going to play where, where they come from, what set of rules are you going to follow?
[00:55:09] What rules are going to bring you the most gratification?
[00:55:13] How, wait, how do you even pick those rules?
[00:55:17] And then once we figured out game, the game that we are going to play, how do we win?
[00:55:26] And I think we'll talk about that on the next, the next podcast.
[00:55:31] So I realized you kind of were in this mode early on and that's when it hit me, dawned
[00:55:36] upon me how there's this long term and short term game going on.
[00:55:43] And there's also, I don't know, maybe if this is more just a different take on the same
[00:55:48] thing, but there's like a small picture and big picture game going on as well.
[00:55:52] Yeah.
[00:55:53] So it's like short term, long term, big picture, small picture.
[00:55:56] And once you realize that's going on, then you can begin kind of the journey of discovery
[00:56:02] of how many of that, how many elements in life that applies to.
[00:56:06] It applies to everything by the way, but you don't, you don't, it doesn't land on you
[00:56:10] till you really realize, okay, this is going on.
[00:56:12] And then everything you do, everything you're interested in, everything you say in a way
[00:56:19] is like that applies to it.
[00:56:22] Short term, long term game, big picture, small picture game.
[00:56:26] Yeah.
[00:56:27] I think it's, I had a similar conversation with Dave Burke.
[00:56:31] Good deal Dave.
[00:56:32] Yeah.
[00:56:33] And it's about oodalooops, right?
[00:56:34] Observe, orient, decide, and act.
[00:56:35] And you got one, you got an oodalooop that you're running like on right now about a business
[00:56:39] decision that you're making with a client that you're going to, you know, talk to later
[00:56:42] today.
[00:56:43] Man.
[00:56:44] You're running, but you're running a oodalooop about that whole division in the company
[00:56:48] and you're running an oodalooop about the whole company and you're running an oodalooop
[00:56:52] about your whole, it's the same thing.
[00:56:54] You're running an oodalooop on your life.
[00:56:56] Like what, observe, where I'm in life right now.
[00:56:58] It's a similar thing.
[00:57:00] Where I might life, observe what's going on, orient yourself where you sit in that big
[00:57:04] picture.
[00:57:05] Yeah.
[00:57:06] But you've got all these different oodalooops and you're running them at the same time.
[00:57:09] So it's the same thing.
[00:57:11] That's why, that's why having this idea, recognizing, I was, I was actually explaining this to my
[00:57:19] daughter.
[00:57:20] And like you could see, as I was explaining it to her, you could see the light bulb.
[00:57:25] Come on.
[00:57:26] Right.
[00:57:27] Like, yes.
[00:57:28] Like, oh, this is a game.
[00:57:29] Oh, that's a game.
[00:57:30] Oh, this other thing's a game.
[00:57:31] And what she said to me is she said, oh, she said, that's why you're detached.
[00:57:37] That's why you're able to detach.
[00:57:38] That's why you don't get mad because this is just a game and you're observing what's
[00:57:43] happening in the game.
[00:57:45] And so you're not going to get emotional because like, well, when you lose a point,
[00:57:50] do you run off the field and break down?
[00:57:53] No.
[00:57:54] You're like, okay, lost a point.
[00:57:55] We'll make some adjustments.
[00:57:56] Like that's the way it is.
[00:57:57] And by the way, there's very, all these little subordinate games that are being played,
[00:58:03] ultimately compared to the Supreme game, they don't really matter that much.
[00:58:07] So you can kind of shrug them off.
[00:58:08] Now listen, we all know that there's people that get wrapped up in a game, right?
[00:58:13] They get wrapped up.
[00:58:14] They're 17 years old.
[00:58:15] They got the girlfriend.
[00:58:16] They get wrapped up in that one relationship game.
[00:58:17] And when she dumps him, that guy's freaking done.
[00:58:20] He wants to kill himself or does kill himself, right?
[00:58:23] Everybody that's watching that goes, Hey man, that was just one little game that you were
[00:58:26] playing.
[00:58:27] What are you doing?
[00:58:29] Don't give it up over one little game.
[00:58:32] That's like you're playing, you know, high pop Warner football.
[00:58:36] You lose a game.
[00:58:39] End of the world.
[00:58:40] No, it's not the end of the world.
[00:58:41] It's one game.
[00:58:42] What has another thing my daughter pointed out.
[00:58:43] It's like, Oh, she goes, Oh, you learn from these games.
[00:58:45] I'm like, yes.
[00:58:46] Yes, you do.
[00:58:47] I do learn from the game.
[00:58:49] Part of the game is, Oh, I made a mistake in the game.
[00:58:51] Cool.
[00:58:52] I just learned and I won't make that mistake again.
[00:58:54] So there's a detachment that comes from this view that's very powerful to utilize just
[00:59:02] to say, Oh, didn't get the job.
[00:59:06] Oh, that's okay.
[00:59:08] That's part of the game that I didn't win in this particular game at that particular
[00:59:11] moment.
[00:59:12] I learned from it.
[00:59:13] Here's what I'm going to do.
[00:59:14] Relationship didn't work out.
[00:59:15] Oh, okay.
[00:59:16] What kind of learn from that?
[00:59:17] Not the end of the world.
[00:59:18] Not the last game I'm ever going to play.
[00:59:19] No one's going to be actually a lot more games.
[00:59:22] So crazy how if you put things into perspective, it's like, Oh man, things become so clear.
[00:59:27] You know what?
[00:59:28] We're tricking distracted.
[00:59:29] That's a thing.
[00:59:30] Cause like, you know, okay.
[00:59:31] You know when you're young, you save money, right?
[00:59:33] Like I don't know.
[00:59:34] You want to buy a slingshot or something like this.
[00:59:36] And you're like, okay, I got to save up $12 to buy that slingshot.
[00:59:40] Boom.
[00:59:41] You're already aware of the game that you're playing short term, long term, you know,
[00:59:45] like, Oh, the Jolly Rancher for sale over there.
[00:59:47] I'm not going to buy that Jolly Rancher cause I'm saving that $1 for this.
[00:59:50] But it is part of it cause that's part of the game too, right?
[00:59:54] Discipline, just understanding the long term is more important than the short term and
[00:59:58] being able to follow through.
[00:59:59] So all it is in a nutshell.
[01:00:01] So you kind of know, that's an example of like knowing the game, but you get distracted.
[01:00:05] Like the Jolly Rancher is like super delicious or someone, you know, something like this.
[01:00:10] That's part of the opponent kind of jamming you up.
[01:00:14] So like, you know, entertainment in general, social media, whatever, TV, Netflix, all this
[01:00:21] stuff.
[01:00:22] These are all like distractions, trying to distract you from your, whatever your goals,
[01:00:26] you're winning your game or whatever and whatever capacity.
[01:00:29] But at the same time, it's part of someone else's game to win their game.
[01:00:32] Yeah.
[01:00:33] And I think the biggest, and this was kind of the opening discussion we had here, the
[01:00:41] worst thing to have happen is you're in the water and you don't know that you're in the
[01:00:46] water.
[01:00:47] You're in the game.
[01:00:48] You don't know that you're in the game.
[01:00:49] So this should be, for some people, this will be hearing what we're talking about.
[01:00:53] It should be a perspective shift for their life, realizing that they're in a game, that
[01:00:58] there's rules, that there's objectives, that you're going to have opponents, you're going
[01:01:02] to have allies.
[01:01:04] All these things are going on.
[01:01:05] They're all going on.
[01:01:07] And if you don't recognize it, you're going to come up short.
[01:01:10] This is what entertainment is.
[01:01:11] Okay.
[01:01:12] In football, there's a lot of, in boxing, there's faints and all this stuff.
[01:01:16] So in football, there's like, there's a bunch of different ways, obviously, but there's
[01:01:19] a play where the quarterback will fake to the full back and then he'll kind of roll
[01:01:25] out and do some stuff.
[01:01:27] So social media and Netflix, all that stuff, what that is, is the fake.
[01:01:30] They make you like pay attention to that thing while they, and they use you.
[01:01:34] They totally use you to pay attention to this one thing.
[01:01:37] Maybe your people on your team are going to pay attention to you a little bit.
[01:01:39] Tell us that fake.
[01:01:40] So they're going to all do what I want them to do while we go do this other thing.
[01:01:44] Meanwhile, you're losing your game.
[01:01:45] We're winning our game, using it as a pawn.
[01:01:48] That's what social media is.
[01:01:49] Oh yeah.
[01:01:50] You're definitely getting played.
[01:01:51] You're definitely getting, they're playing a game.
[01:01:53] And if you're sitting there and it's eating up your brain, they're winning the game.
[01:01:57] You probably don't even know you're in the game.
[01:01:59] You don't realize that they're taking your information and selling it and all that stuff.
[01:02:03] That's what's going on.
[01:02:04] Oh yeah.
[01:02:05] The whole game.
[01:02:06] Like yeah, all around, all around.
[01:02:08] Don't pay attention to it.
[01:02:09] We will continue this on the next podcast.
[01:02:14] In the meantime, you know what you're going to need on the health side.
[01:02:18] Yep.
[01:02:19] Going to need to be healthy.
[01:02:20] You need some healthy fuel.
[01:02:21] Get yourself some jocofuel.
[01:02:22] Jocofuel.com.
[01:02:23] Drinking some energy drinks right now.
[01:02:26] Yep.
[01:02:27] I'm on the MOLK train right here.
[01:02:28] Oh yeah.
[01:02:29] How's that banana?
[01:02:30] Banana all day.
[01:02:31] Banana cream.
[01:02:32] There's a difference.
[01:02:33] Yeah, it's true.
[01:02:34] There's a difference.
[01:02:35] Yeah.
[01:02:36] Banana cream is always good in my opinion.
[01:02:37] I've never tasted a banana cream.
[01:02:39] Anything that wasn't good, this is no exception.
[01:02:42] So tasty.
[01:02:43] Tasty.
[01:02:44] It's, you know what's nice about the MOLK?
[01:02:45] Like I got done training yesterday and I got done training the day before and I got done
[01:02:49] training the day before.
[01:02:51] And every day when I got done training on the way out, I just went ahead and just grabbed
[01:02:57] the MOLK.
[01:02:58] You're good.
[01:02:59] Just on the road, on the drive home.
[01:03:01] Seven minute drive home.
[01:03:02] Here's 30 grams of protein.
[01:03:04] Yeah.
[01:03:05] Right?
[01:03:06] How good is that?
[01:03:07] What did you know on the weekends?
[01:03:09] So Friday, Saturday, well I guess Friday I happen to get some training in this Friday,
[01:03:12] but Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I'm waking up, lifting, running, coming to Jiu Jitsu, no
[01:03:21] food.
[01:03:22] Yeah.
[01:03:23] Oh damn, no food after that?
[01:03:24] Okay.
[01:03:25] No, I might have some, I might have like a handful of nuts or whatever.
[01:03:28] Yeah.
[01:03:29] Like a handful.
[01:03:30] But I want to go, I don't want to go training with the big like gut full of food.
[01:03:33] How long between end of the running, lifting scenario and the Jiu Jitsu, how long in between?
[01:03:39] An hour and a half, two hours or something like this.
[01:03:41] Yeah.
[01:03:42] Okay.
[01:03:43] That's why I have like a little, maybe a handful of nuts.
[01:03:45] Maybe I'll have, you know, I've been having a lot lately is just mozzarella cheese with
[01:03:49] some olive oil and balsamic vinegar on it.
[01:03:51] Oh yeah, bro.
[01:03:52] I love those.
[01:03:53] That's one of my things now.
[01:03:54] Yeah.
[01:03:55] Right.
[01:03:56] Yeah.
[01:03:57] Sarah made these yesterday and the day before.
[01:03:58] And she doesn't always make that.
[01:03:59] Did she put the basil on there?
[01:04:00] Yes.
[01:04:01] And a tomato.
[01:04:02] I don't like the tomatoes, but the, but even that, I don't really want to have that.
[01:04:07] I want to come to Jiu Jitsu and I want to have like a pretty empty stomach.
[01:04:11] So you know what I will, on the way I'll have a go and you know, Wes, but first of all,
[01:04:16] Wes is just like already too strong and too flexible and too good at Jiu Jitsu and he
[01:04:20] rolls in and he's pounding a go.
[01:04:22] Like he, he's doing it in my face or like trying to get it, trying to get in my head.
[01:04:26] Right.
[01:04:27] He's like, oh, he's pounding that thing.
[01:04:28] I'm like, dude.
[01:04:29] So then I started getting after it.
[01:04:31] You know, so now I have a go on the drive here and I have a, I have a go on the drive
[01:04:35] here.
[01:04:36] I have a mok on the way home.
[01:04:37] This is a great combo.
[01:04:39] This is a great combo.
[01:04:41] So jockelfield.com, go to vitamin shop, go to Wawa, go to the military commissaries,
[01:04:48] go to Hannaford, go to H-E-B.

[01:05:08] Tell the store.
[01:05:09] So say, hey, look, there's no go.
[01:05:12] There's no whatever, whatever it is that they're missing.

[01:05:26] Talk about that, that health and capability game.
[01:05:29] Yeah, it was Peter Tia where he was making a broader point, but he was like, hey, if
[01:05:35] you want to kick ass at 80, you can't be slacking at 70 or whatever the numbers were.
[01:05:43] They might have been different.
[01:05:44] But it's basically like, hey, this is a long-term play.
[01:05:46] You can't just jam yourself up and ignore it and whatever.
[01:05:48] And then once you start getting older, then try to jump on the trail.
[01:05:51] It's like, Brad, you can still be jammed up.
[01:05:55] You know what I'm saying?
[01:05:56] Yeah.
[01:05:57] You know what?
[01:05:58] You lose a little bit at a time.
[01:05:59] You know, I was talking to Bert Soren.
[01:06:01] Sure.
[01:06:02] And we were just talking about lifting.
[01:06:05] And he's just about beast.
[01:06:08] But basically, I was saying, hey, if there's like an exercise, you know, when you get injured
[01:06:13] and you can't do a particular exercise, like for instance, when my arm was hurt, I couldn't
[01:06:17] do overhead squats for a long period of time.
[01:06:20] After Dean Lister freaking crashed my arm, showing a move, by the way, Dean Lister.
[01:06:27] Anyways, I couldn't like lock my arms out for an overhead squat.
[01:06:32] And for months, I couldn't do an overhead squat.
[01:06:35] And so then when I eventually could do it again, it was really humbling.
[01:06:38] It was like PVC pipe.
[01:06:40] You know, you're like thinking, God, but when we're talking to Bert, like, hey, don't submit.
[01:06:46] Don't surrender that movement.
[01:06:48] Because it's real easy to just say, that's something I can no longer do.
[01:06:52] And it happens a little bit at a time.
[01:06:54] Right?
[01:06:55] It's like one day.
[01:06:56] I don't know if I can really do them today.
[01:07:00] And then the next time, maybe you can't really do them.
[01:07:03] So just pay attention to that, man.
[01:07:05] You got to that physical part that we're talking, this physical game that we're talking about.
[01:07:12] It's a long term strategic game that's that's the death of a thousand cuts.
[01:07:18] And look, you know what, you're eventually going to lose.
[01:07:20] Like 100% you're going to lose.
[01:07:22] Right?
[01:07:23] Like I'm going to.
[01:07:24] At this point, it actually looks like I might get old and die.
[01:07:27] You should think I wouldn't get old and die, but this one kind of looks like I might get
[01:07:30] old and die.
[01:07:31] So you know, you're going to go with death of a thousand cuts, but you can postpone
[01:07:37] one cut today.
[01:07:38] Push one cut off today.
[01:07:40] That's another day you went.
[01:07:41] You know, it's another day without that little, that little razor cutting your tendons and
[01:07:46] whatnot.
[01:07:47] So that's what we're doing.

[01:08:26] If you buy those other brands, I'm going to go and say, don't do that.
