[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 356 with echo Charles and me jockel willing good evening echo good evening
[00:00:07] Gettysburg was a great battle
[00:00:10] Its action its tension its hazards its consequences
[00:00:16] In it were involved questions of gravest import the decision of which makes history
[00:00:23] interests social political moral personal of
[00:00:27] Gravest import for ourselves for others for our country for man everywhere
[00:00:36] For the present time and for the future for which also we hold a trust
[00:00:44] The pressing question before us was whether we had a country
[00:00:50] Whether we were a people or only a populace
[00:00:53] Whether we were a mere chance partnership only holding only by human will or a nation
[00:01:02] constituted in the purpose and calling of divine providence bound together for the noblest ends of living by ties of mutual
[00:01:11] interest and honor
[00:01:13] bonds both of love and law
[00:01:15] All the great ruling sentiments which have their vital source in this idea
[00:01:23] patriotism loyalty self devotion for the sake of others
[00:01:27] Nay what we consider the supreme of earthly blessings largest scope for individual life
[00:01:34] endowments powers genius character
[00:01:38] These were the prize for which we wrestled in that terrible arena
[00:01:42] more than this
[00:01:46] Involved here, too
[00:01:48] Were the widest human interests
[00:01:51] We fought for the worth of manhood for law and liberty
[00:01:56] Which mean freedom for every man to make the most of himself with goodwill of all others
[00:02:04] Without oppression or depression
[00:02:07] We had a deep inward vision of this at the time though unspoken and perhaps unclear
[00:02:15] But no man even now can realize in thought or recognize in fact all the reach of good coming forth out of that struggle
[00:02:24] and that victory for the country and
[00:02:28] for mankind
[00:02:30] And that right there is a quote
[00:02:36] from a speech by Colonel Joshua Chamberlain
[00:02:40] And he was at a banquet to honor the 16th Maine Infantry and
[00:02:45] The fifth main light artillery battery knows a 16th Maine
[00:02:50] Who on July 1st 1863?
[00:02:54] They were ordered to hold a position at Chambersburg Pike
[00:02:58] But this element of men was eventually overrun and as they were being overrun
[00:03:06] They took down their flag their regimental flag and
[00:03:11] They ripped it to shreds so that it wouldn't be captured
[00:03:17] by the Confederates and
[00:03:19] Of their sacrifice of their 275 men 11 were killed 62 were wounded 159 were taken prisoner
[00:03:26] but
[00:03:27] Because they did that because they held the line as long as they did it allowed
[00:03:32] 16,000 other Union troops to retreat and regroup around Gettysburg
[00:03:39] And of course it was the next day July 2nd when the 20th Maine
[00:03:45] Under the charge of Joshua Chamberlain was able to hold the Union's left flank on little round top with a bayonet charge
[00:03:52] That stopped the Confederates the Confederate Army's best chance for victory in that battle
[00:03:57] and
[00:03:59] Essentially at that point turned the or at least started to turn the tide of the war
[00:04:06] And it's no surprise
[00:04:08] In my humble opinion that these soldiers from Maine accounted themselves so well
[00:04:14] They're from a state that has
[00:04:17] harsh winners
[00:04:19] rugged terrain and a culture of hard work and self-reliance and
[00:04:25] And today we have someone with us that has become a manor
[00:04:31] After retiring from the SEAL teams and is now looking to serve his country and his state again
[00:04:37] His name is Ed Thielander and he's here with us tonight to share some of his experiences and lessons learned Ed
[00:04:44] Thanks for joining us man. Hey, thank you very much for having me on. This is awesome. It was awesome to get out here
[00:04:50] You know, I went out to Coronado last night
[00:04:53] and
[00:04:54] Watch some, you know some tadpoles playing on the on the old course
[00:04:59] And it hasn't changed much, you know
[00:05:02] It's that's one thing I miss from you know jumping over to the east coast was seeing these young frog, you know
[00:05:09] Men wannabes just get after it and and try and figure out, you know
[00:05:14] How to negotiate their obstacles on their own time after training and yeah, and yeah Washington run back and forth to Chow
[00:05:22] You know, you run six miles a day just to go eat in boots
[00:05:27] That's not kind of work out that's just to go eat and watching that was pretty cool
[00:05:33] So yeah, it's great to be back out on the west coast check it out for a little while and I'll be popping back over to these coasters
[00:05:40] Tonight. Yeah, the O course is all fenced off now. Yeah, I just walk out there and do it
[00:05:45] And I mean back in the day a civilian could basically walk out there and just run the O course and now it's all fenced off
[00:05:52] Which is a bummer because you know, it's kind of cool that you could just roll out there and run that thing
[00:05:58] Yeah, that's a pretty brutal O course
[00:06:01] And we'll get into that look before we get there before we talk about your buds your teams experience and all that let's start at the beginning
[00:06:07] Let's start where you came from where you grew up. What was going on? You're from originally from Michigan. Yeah, yeah Romeo, Michigan
[00:06:13] So so what was going on growing up?
[00:06:16] So, yeah
[00:06:17] Born in Marquette. My dad
[00:06:20] It was going to school up there
[00:06:22] You know, my dad did six years in the Navy and then what do you do in the Navy?
[00:06:25] He was a missile tech, you know subs. He wanted he was trying to talk me into go be in a nuke. Dang
[00:06:32] It's a hard conversation
[00:06:34] You keep telling me yeah, you get steak and lobster, you know, and you don't even have to get up to get a drink
[00:06:41] You know because you know people yeah, that's because you can't get up to get a drink
[00:06:46] It's so crowded. Yeah, and then you run out of fresh milk on you know with the fifth day and
[00:06:52] You know, they never turn the lights off or
[00:06:55] In the hallways, you know, it's it's or I'm sorry in in birthing in birthing
[00:07:01] They never turn them on except once a week to clean and then they go in there and pull up all the deck plates and get food out
[00:07:06] Did you ever do sub ops when you when you were in? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I was at SDV
[00:07:10] Oh, gosh, so I mean which is just funny
[00:07:12] Yeah, you know team guys with nothing to do because we're kind of all ready for whatever we're gonna go do and we've got nothing to do except make jokes
[00:07:18] and cause trouble, you know, we were on the Dallas and
[00:07:24] We're the first ones, you know getting ready to eat because we're ready to go do our little gig and there's this little S-turn
[00:07:30] and
[00:07:32] So we all line up and there's this pipe that sits right about head height right about here
[00:07:37] And we all lined up. So you had to hit it
[00:07:41] But all the sub guys
[00:07:43] Now they just you know shifted the head around it. It was every diver and team guy that whacked right into that thing
[00:07:51] Yeah, that submarine life is is a different kind of life. Yeah respect to the guys that do it. I mean, it's I
[00:07:58] Could I I would I think the longest I was ever on a submarine four was like maybe a
[00:08:04] Week and a half or something like that. We were on we went on to go do some to go get inserted somewhere and bad weather came
[00:08:11] And I wouldn't launch us. So we were just stuck there, right? That was my first experience with hot racking, right?
[00:08:17] You know, you know what that is echo? No, I'm racking. It means when you share a bed with someone
[00:08:22] So like you're you're working one shift when you get done
[00:08:27] I when you go to work I get in your bed. So we share a bed. Yeah, take turns. Yeah, take turns
[00:08:33] Yeah, yeah, it's yeah, you can have two to three guys. Yeah
[00:08:37] Not cool. So so when you get on with the SDV, you know
[00:08:42] The SDV is a little wet submarine for folks that don't know and they put this basically this garage on the back of a submarine
[00:08:48] And it is it's wildly awesome because you that whole thing is dedicated from moving, you know
[00:08:55] To or six guys from point A to point B this big giant garage door opens up
[00:09:00] The SDV goes out, you know, 10 12 20 hours later that thing comes back
[00:09:05] it's pretty wild but
[00:09:08] We bring a bunch of folks on there to help us out and get everything ready. So they clear out a rack of torpedoes and
[00:09:16] That becomes your bear with your beds, you know, it's just so I gave up my bed to one of my guys
[00:09:22] because I was getting off and he was gonna stay on and work the comms problem and
[00:09:28] I'm you know decent sized guy. I can't turn in under that torpedo rack because the next torpedo above you
[00:09:36] I actually have to squish my shoulders in tight and
[00:09:40] And they in the
[00:09:43] Torpedo area they do not turn the lights off. Yeah, that thing's just always on everywhere else. They kind of cycle daylight
[00:09:51] In the work other working areas except the torpedo area. So you're just in there
[00:09:56] You know, they do put up a curtain it means nothing your shoulder to shoulder head to head with you know, whatever it is 20 other dudes
[00:10:04] And your dad's trying to convince you that this is the way to go. Yeah, go be a yeah. So was he a Submariner?
[00:10:10] Yeah, yeah, he did six years. No, he was a torpedo man. He was trying to talk me into being a nuke
[00:10:16] And those nuke guys they work hard man
[00:10:20] It is no joke. Yeah, that job is a tough
[00:10:24] Grueling in the friggin nuclear engine room or what I don't know what you call it the reactor room, right?
[00:10:31] So to work out on a submarine
[00:10:34] You got to put your dosometer on because you got to walk past the nuclear reactor and then they've got it's they're all quiet
[00:10:39] Workouts they did have a square block of
[00:10:42] dumbbells, you know
[00:10:44] Which is you know, they all wear tennis shoes so you don't make noise
[00:10:47] You know so you don't get no noise can hear you from above and then it's you know, it's an elliptical not a treadmill
[00:10:54] So, you know, I don't want to pound in other feet
[00:10:56] It's yeah, you can do pull-ups on something and you got those dumbbells in it and elliptical
[00:11:02] Yeah, it is check an ideal life for a guy that has a more of a propensity to be a seal, right?
[00:11:09] Right. All right. So your dad. So what'd your dad do after he got out of the Navy?
[00:11:13] So, yeah, he went went to college up in northern Michigan Michigan Tech in
[00:11:19] So driven in three years working two jobs. He got his bachelor's and his master's
[00:11:26] and you know
[00:11:28] with with three boys and then moving down to
[00:11:32] Southern Michigan teacher electronics teacher. So
[00:11:36] It was a good in high school high school high school electronics teacher. Yeah, and it was legit. I we were
[00:11:42] You would do all this after-school work and weekend work with his kids
[00:11:46] You know his students and we'd be in there climbing in and around all the electronic gear
[00:11:51] And he'd have us making circuit boards it what I remember to be a ridiculously young age a good ridiculous, you know
[00:11:59] I mean like five years old burning circuit boards
[00:12:03] You know it we made stuff
[00:12:07] flashing lights whatever
[00:12:08] But it was all fun and games and then all of a sudden we can do some wild stuff, you know
[00:12:12] we were always forced to
[00:12:14] Figure things out. I took electricity in high school with the teacher. I don't we all ever called him Scotty
[00:12:22] But that's where I learned how to like wire houses, you know
[00:12:25] Yeah, and it to this day like I mean at one of my houses
[00:12:29] I this is when I was still in the teams like took a weekend
[00:12:32] And redid put an electrical sub panel redid all the wiring in my kitchen cuz all jacked up and like such a great skill to have
[00:12:39] Oh, yeah, and it's yeah, it's all stuck with me, you know, I figure stuff out
[00:12:45] We never had a new TV ever we fixed all those old tube TVs, you know and change the channel with the pliers, you know
[00:12:53] We fixed our cars, you know from fixing our bicycles when we were young young and then we got motorcycles, you know little
[00:13:02] You know wisey 60s
[00:13:05] And we tore those down to nothing and put them all back together again first truck, you know
[00:13:10] That was given to me to use
[00:13:13] You start that thing up at a cloud of smoke and then we tore the whole thing down
[00:13:18] You know in high school on the weekends because they had a lift and all that stuff
[00:13:23] So did you go to school where your dad taught? No, no
[00:13:27] He was like like the the big high school north or south of us, you know 2000 plus kids
[00:13:35] We were like the the smallest of the big schools, you know
[00:13:40] So so 32 mile center of town was paved
[00:13:43] 33 mile road was dirt so we live close to the dirt road
[00:13:46] It's a what when when you were in school are you into school you're getting good grades getting decent grades, you know into the sports, you know
[00:13:56] Football wrestling and then track kind of drop track off at the end and just concentrated on football and wrestling
[00:14:04] You know like school, but not crazy into it, you know like the math, you know decent grades. I was a b-ish student, you know
[00:14:14] nothing definitely
[00:14:16] Not way into it. Were you thinking you were going to go to college or what was your dad steering you towards or your mom steering you towards?
[00:14:21] So I was getting steered towards the navy college navy college navy college, you know
[00:14:27] My dad really, you know
[00:14:29] Went up to ferris state university division two school as a college first year
[00:14:33] I was there became a university whatever that jump that's weird that so you would end up going to college one-year college
[00:14:38] Yep, and you said you got a scholarship. No. Oh, no, no
[00:14:43] Um, no just my dad went up there. They just me get me on the wrestling team wanted me to you know do that, you know
[00:14:50] Good team. So you're a good wrestler decent, you know, I enjoy a high school state wrestling did not make the states messed up my knee
[00:14:57] in
[00:14:58] Ended up having surgery on it
[00:15:01] Yeah, I just had like two-thirds of menacex taken out
[00:15:04] When you're like 17. Yeah. Yeah
[00:15:07] so so
[00:15:09] I had that surgery
[00:15:11] And in two weeks I went to wrestling camp
[00:15:16] So was that your senior year? Yeah, that was my senior year
[00:15:19] It and then you healed up enough that you could go up and you walked on to this wrestling team at ferris state university
[00:15:25] Yep, and I was a red shirt, you know, I did not compete
[00:15:29] But I stuck it all the way out. I mean I started we started out with like 90 kids and it was like 17 left it
[00:15:35] You know at the end, but I
[00:15:36] I was good weight for my coach. What weight were you? 163?
[00:15:39] 165 whatever it was in college
[00:15:42] So you're just scrapping with the yeah, our coach was was you know number one in the nation
[00:15:48] You know who I when I came out here to to san diego his big rival
[00:15:53] um
[00:15:54] Butler was
[00:15:56] You know, they were number one number two. I remember my coach in college was number two butler was number one
[00:16:01] uh, and uh
[00:16:03] It was cool because I was working out out under butler at the time. I would go work out at uh
[00:16:08] Uh, san diego community college and russell there, you know where dean actually ended up going
[00:16:14] We had the same coach a couple years difference
[00:16:18] That's a while. Yeah. Yeah, uh, so you say you only went to you only went to college for a year. Yeah
[00:16:25] halfway through and I was on a
[00:16:29] Plastics engineering program that there wasn't room for everybody to do all all the plastic classes
[00:16:34] So I was on a waiting list. So I was taking my english my math. I took a 300 level metallurgy class as a freshman
[00:16:41] And uh, I got out of there halfway through the year. I said yep, I'm gonna go do the option
[00:16:46] You know finish this year out strong and then I'm gonna go be a seal
[00:16:50] How'd you hear about the teams did your dad tell you about them? No, uh
[00:16:54] Adam I guess you say adam Blake good dude, um in high school. He was reading men with green faces
[00:17:00] Yeah, like the only book about seal teams at the time and I go hey
[00:17:05] What's that about?
[00:17:06] He goes, oh, that's a seal teams, you know, blah blah blah. I go. Oh, that's cool
[00:17:10] He was trying to talk me into joining the Marine Corps with him
[00:17:13] Which he eventually ended up doing
[00:17:15] But I said hey, how come you don't want to go do that? Oh, that's crazy. You know, that's so hard. It's not really possible
[00:17:23] check
[00:17:24] And then so that put it in my head. That's what I want to do and I'll go and do the college and then you know
[00:17:30] Can't quit anything never allowed to quit anything as a child, you know
[00:17:33] So I finished the year out strong and I signed up
[00:17:37] For the late entry I worked out a little bit in the summer did a couple of
[00:17:41] Triathlons, you know because I didn't know anything about what I was really getting
[00:17:45] There were no books about it. There was nothing really no prep courses. No, what the recruiters say to you
[00:17:50] Um, come on in. Yep. Sounds great. Looks like you're gonna make a great seal. Great. See, you know, he tells everybody else
[00:17:57] Right, right. Uh, yeah
[00:17:59] So, you know, it took the asfab and all that happy stuff and you know smoke that qualified to be a new qualified to do whatever
[00:18:06] Um, and uh, was your dad like see son? Yeah, new. Yeah, you're still trying, you know
[00:18:11] What'd your dad say once you told me you're gonna try and go on the teams?
[00:18:14] Oh
[00:18:16] Yeah, cool. But at the same time, hey, you you really want to look in and you know
[00:18:19] Be in a nuke. Yeah
[00:18:22] You know being on subs is cool, you know the whole steak and lobster thing and you know, you don't have to get up to get a drink
[00:18:27] and you know, they're all a bunch of good dudes, but uh
[00:18:31] Yeah, I don't belong in a submarine
[00:18:34] I get on the sub to get off the sub to go do something
[00:18:38] And then so did they have dye fair were you died for the dye fair? That's what I was too. No, so yeah, you get a guarantee
[00:18:45] to
[00:18:46] Take a try out. Yeah
[00:18:48] In boot camp
[00:18:51] And then whether you pass that test or not
[00:18:54] You are in the navy for six years. Yeah, it's a great recruiting tool
[00:18:58] It is a great recruiting tool and that's the the seal teams is a great recruiting tool. Oh, yeah
[00:19:03] because it if you know, they say that the the attrition rate is like
[00:19:08] 80 people quit or whatever something like that, right? But if you start taking all the people that
[00:19:13] Came in the navy to try and go to the seal teams. I mean, there's
[00:19:19] Most people don't even make it, you know two butts or at least a bunch of people don't make it two rights
[00:19:25] So they're the navy is getting a lot of a lot of people
[00:19:29] We're just you know blue angels. They mean that's on all the commercials. That's true, too. Yeah, who gets to do that seven of them or something like that
[00:19:35] You know and it's cool to be on the blue angels changing tires, but but that's not what they're advertising
[00:19:44] All right, so you join the navy you have no house boot camp. You're no factor. You a wrestler
[00:19:49] Yeah, no boot camp was just something to go through is it was pretty wild to go to Orlando or Chicago
[00:19:55] Yeah, oh, that's where all the die fairs when it's time. Okay. That's where I went to so I guess that makes sense
[00:20:00] It's wild seeing all these folks come from you know that that
[00:20:03] Boot camp was a factor like a wow factor either the teamwork part of it, you know
[00:20:09] People getting authority as a recruit that like yeah, you never have to you should never have authority
[00:20:16] and that and and see people stressed out about the
[00:20:21] simplest of things
[00:20:23] and that was wild to see those differences in people that that
[00:20:27] Uh, um, wow, you know, so yeah boot camp off the books, you know
[00:20:33] Boot camp navy boot camp is different. It's a lot about isolation and staying on a ship
[00:20:39] You're only allowed off the ship one time, you know for like the recruit weekend or something like that
[00:20:45] uh, you have you know
[00:20:48] That's what the navy's about. You're stuck on a boat and the navy's about like blue collar
[00:20:53] Industrial work. That's what most of the navy is sure and that's why navy boot camp is a lot about attention to detail
[00:21:01] Sure, you know following directions to a tee
[00:21:04] You know checking what you checking your work because you know if you're working on an aircraft
[00:21:07] You're working on a engine or you're working on a parachute like all these jobs
[00:21:12] They're industrial jobs. Yeah, and you got to be squared away at that thing, you know, as opposed to the army or the marine corps
[00:21:18] A lot of those are field jobs. You got to be doing something in the field. I mean, of course the marine corps has
[00:21:23] aircraft mechanics and everything else too and so does the army but that the navy is
[00:21:28] vast majority of it is industrial work people that know how to work on engines people that know how to work on
[00:21:34] Electronic equipment. That's what it is. Right. So that's what the navy boot camp is geared to
[00:21:37] I think it's it's come a long way now if you go watch like a navy boot camp video
[00:21:42] They have a simulator
[00:21:44] In Chicago like a ship simulator that fills with water and you gotta fight fires and so that I think they did
[00:21:51] Do a good job. It looks like they've done a good job at making it more
[00:21:55] A little bit more combat related or at least like navy war fighting to at least get you that mentality
[00:22:01] Because you should have that mentality if you're in the navy. So I think they've done a good job moving in that direction
[00:22:05] But essentially it's a bunch of industrial work that you're learning how to do. Yeah, you know
[00:22:10] You know thick thin thin thick. Yeah, yeah, I don't type the t-shirt the way you fold the t-shirt
[00:22:15] This is the echo Charles. So when you fold the t-shirt for navy boot camp standards
[00:22:19] There's like a certain way to fold it and it ends up looking like there's a thin layer
[00:22:23] Then the thick layer then there's a thin layer a thin layer and then another thick layer
[00:22:27] And then you got to learn this and you do it like following orders
[00:22:32] Tension of detail tension of detail before you get to play with the nuclear reactor
[00:22:35] We want to make sure you can fold the t-shirt wait. What's thick and what's thin?
[00:22:39] I don't know. It's the folds. Yeah, there's other material under there. So the first fold is
[00:22:44] Thick the next two folds are thin and then there's another thick one. It's just the way it's just a
[00:22:49] It's it's this funny thing that you know, I mean that was 1988
[00:22:54] I don't know if they still have it, but I know life babbon still folds his shirts like in a navy manner
[00:23:00] Yeah, I was like bro. He went to the naval academy. What the hell is that? I saw his stuff folded. I was like, yeah
[00:23:05] I was going over here. Yeah, it's stuck. It is a little attention to detail things. But you know, some of these folks couldn't
[00:23:12] There was this
[00:23:14] Brilliant, you know young man kid
[00:23:17] And he wigged out in the end started crying. Oh, yeah, you definitely see some people wig out. I mean, I just don't doubt about that
[00:23:24] Wow
[00:23:26] I mean, I understand some other things, you know what I like I wouldn't have wigged out for that
[00:23:29] But I get it, you know sears school and you know, and it's anybody wig out the teams
[00:23:33] But I saw him see it wig out in sears school. But uh, not navy boot camp. They yell at you. You know, that's an expectation
[00:23:41] Should be
[00:23:42] You know, but but some people just aren't used to that in their life, you know and
[00:23:47] Wow, yeah, I think also people get the impression that this is what the whole navy is going to be like for the rest of my career
[00:23:51] People are gonna be yelling and screaming and right and you think
[00:23:55] I can't take this and leave or you know
[00:23:57] I just want to make sure you can stand up to a little bit of stress because eventually something might get stressful
[00:24:01] Yeah, for sure
[00:24:03] Uh, so you get down. So do you go straight to buds after that? Would you go to a school? Yeah, kormin eights
[00:24:08] So remember maps, right? Yeah, your military and processing
[00:24:12] Yeah, put a fifth choice down because I put all I only I only wanted to be a seal
[00:24:17] You know our source ratings you had to pick a source rating because if washed out you would go to the navy and do that
[00:24:23] Uh, so I put down, you know three choices in an alternate
[00:24:27] Well, I still didn't pick kormin yet. So I said why don't you put down a fifth alternate?
[00:24:33] And so I got the fifth alternate core school, but it was the navy. Yeah last easy class
[00:24:37] It was only eight weeks
[00:24:39] next class shifted like 14 weeks and uh, you know trudged through that and uh
[00:24:45] Off to what should have been buds, but they messed my orders my orders up and sent me to balboa
[00:24:51] You know because they were like we're not a my
[00:24:53] Class 163 didn't start till whatever it was april whatever so they weren't going to get me there till like a week before
[00:25:02] You know, but you still had pre-training and they didn't care they needed somebody to go work
[00:25:06] You know somebody at the hospital was saying hey, we need some bodies
[00:25:10] Damn, so they sent me there and I was working for a really good senior chief and I said hey, you know, uh
[00:25:16] This is what I got going on. I don't think it's quite right
[00:25:18] And you know, I'm just a new kid in the navy and I'm still like hey, this isn't right. Um, can we check it out?
[00:25:25] And so I what I would do is I would go run down to rtc from balboa and I found you know
[00:25:31] Senior chief billy hill and and gobbled and I said hey, uh, you know senior chiefs
[00:25:35] Can I get a little help here because I don't think this is right? I think we yeah, that's not right
[00:25:39] Go get your swim in we'll fix it
[00:25:41] And so they fixed my orders, but it took a couple weeks
[00:25:44] So then I I got to buds and a week and a half later I classed up and started damn
[00:25:50] And you know class 163. Yeah
[00:25:53] And you classed up a week and a half after you got there. Yeah, you said that's uh, that's a little bit of a
[00:26:00] Quick start
[00:26:01] Yeah, because I didn't know anything, you know, I'm seeing everybody there. They like got their you know that rope around their belt
[00:26:07] You know and say hey, what's that about? Oh, yeah, we're doing underwater knot tying tomorrow
[00:26:11] Jack. Yeah
[00:26:13] Were you a good swimmer?
[00:26:15] I was a decent swimmer, you know, um, you know, I sink like a rock
[00:26:18] I basically, you know beat the water into submission
[00:26:21] Everybody's ever been a tried to be a real swimmer. You cannot beat the water into submission and go faster, you know
[00:26:28] It yeah, they sound like you sound like my kind of swimmer. Yeah, it's me against me fighting the water
[00:26:34] Yeah, uh, somewhat vertical through the water plane. Yeah
[00:26:38] I sink like a stone, but you are comfortable like not time when it did come
[00:26:41] Yeah, I do as a kid, you know, but you know not tying
[00:26:46] Okay, how do you tie that? You know those series of knots, you know, I didn't know and you know, that's what we're doing tomorrow
[00:26:52] Okay, how do you tie those knots?
[00:26:55] How was hell week for you and your class?
[00:26:58] Uh, yeah, uh, you know summer hell weeks, you know, just
[00:27:03] They're warmer, um, you know, uh
[00:27:06] Uh, these these other guys that are thinner are they are gonna suffer before I was because I was I'm you know, the mesomorph
[00:27:13] You know, I'm naturally heavier guy. Um, so basically they
[00:27:19] Kept that boat on your head longer and you know, my neck will tell you about that today still
[00:27:25] Yeah, uh
[00:27:26] Yeah, you know, um
[00:27:28] Remember remembering all the wild things about about hell week, you know, you know, what was your worst, you know, thinking hell week
[00:27:33] Tuesday
[00:27:39] So, uh
[00:27:44] Ryan Zinke what was uh
[00:27:47] Our first phase officer
[00:27:49] And at at uh chow times eat four times a day at chow time
[00:27:54] He would go around and make sure no one fell asleep
[00:27:57] And if you nod it off
[00:27:58] You're gonna get a jalapeno
[00:28:00] You know, so ed being from michigan and you know roast beef and mashed potatoes, you know
[00:28:07] Peppers like the ultimate spice and you sparingly my mom's, you know, french canada. There's it's a lot more bland food
[00:28:13] I've never had a jalapeno in my life and your lips are blistered, you know
[00:28:19] So it eats the jalapeno check
[00:28:23] And I threw up
[00:28:25] You know, it's a one mile run with a boat on your head
[00:28:28] I threw up for a mile and a little bit because we ran all the way to the oak horse
[00:28:32] And we did the oak horse with our boat
[00:28:34] And I threw up all the way through that oak horse hauling the boat around and then I've got no
[00:28:41] Fuel in the tank
[00:28:43] That was a long long day
[00:28:46] Yeah, I remember that, you know, and then remember the other things about, you know, the hallucin is a you know hallucinating
[00:28:51] You know, you know, lion's lope, you know, the uh
[00:28:55] You know getting mad at my paddle. I remember though my paddle is not, you know, you know making us go
[00:29:01] I'm crying hard, you know, that this paddle should make me go faster, you know, uh
[00:29:07] Yeah, remembering paddle prayers, you know
[00:29:12] What's paddle prayers?
[00:29:14] So they would put us together around in a circle. Oh, it's we have paddle above the other guy's head
[00:29:20] You got your paddle
[00:29:21] So you got your paddle so you're like this and when you fall asleep you try and catch yourself and you whack the tune
[00:29:29] Is that in the program?
[00:29:33] Yeah, uh, you know, I was a really motivated young, you know, uh number one bow line man
[00:29:39] You know the guy the guy that jumps out on the rock portage and and here's the boat
[00:29:44] I wanted to be that guy, you know, uh, that's the spot man. That's the spot get in there
[00:29:49] Let's do this and when that boat's upside down on your head, uh, that's spot too because you're taking some serious weight
[00:29:55] Yeah, that's a dangerous evolution in big waves man. Good old rock portage, you know, we didn't have helmets
[00:30:01] Yeah, you know, we had k-pox, you know, a big giant, you know horribly uncomfortable life jackets, uh, and uh
[00:30:09] Wow now they got helmets, you know, I dude I I noticed they took the stump jump completely out now
[00:30:14] Yeah, but they reduced the stumps first
[00:30:17] And now the stumps are all gone and they're tight as you know, and that's kind because that's a mental thing
[00:30:23] you know, um, everybody knew the right stump to jump on
[00:30:27] it's just that
[00:30:29] All the fear of falling. Yeah, and I don't remember anybody falling. I you know, I don't know that somebody fell and they hit their head
[00:30:34] I don't know what the echo this is on on the obstacle course
[00:30:39] One of the first was I guess was this actually the second obstacle you go across that dip bar thing, right, right?
[00:30:44] and then you hop off and there'd be
[00:30:46] Telephone poles caught off at various heights in the ground like stumps
[00:30:51] And you would have to jump from stump to stump to stump and they'd kind of increase in heights and the last one
[00:30:56] Was a little was depending on which route if you took the right route, which everybody knew right last one was the tallest one
[00:31:03] Had to jump a little bit further for it. And then you could jump you jump up onto this
[00:31:08] Grab this wall this low wall, which was probably like 10 10 feet. Yeah something like that from the stump from the stump
[00:31:13] Oh, yeah, but it did take
[00:31:16] It did take like a what's commitment right commitment to jump from stump to stump and a guy you used to
[00:31:25] Committing right and now it's just tires like you see on a football field, you know, you run the tires
[00:31:29] Oh, yeah, you're right about that psychological part right right there. There's a fear of falling
[00:31:33] It's just like, you know, if you focus on the the stump that you might fall on you're not looking at the stump that you want
[00:31:39] You know like if you're are you skiers?
[00:31:42] Yeah, you know if you ski with a helmet on
[00:31:45] And then you take your helmet off
[00:31:47] There you see you ski slower, especially if you ski in the trees. I mean you're skiing in the trees and
[00:31:54] If you're looking
[00:31:56] For the gaps you're good to go if you're looking for the trees that you don't want to hit you're gonna find that tree
[00:32:02] You know and it's the same kind of thing. It's it's it's it's a psychological thing
[00:32:05] You know to get you moving forward. Yep
[00:32:08] And they got helmets now too that they wear all the time which is weird too because like even during hell week they wear helmets
[00:32:15] Really?
[00:32:16] Which is to me the agony of that boat grinding on your head was like a huge part of of what's oh, yeah
[00:32:25] Yeah, guys
[00:32:27] You're getting you know your head getting some serious sunburn. You don't have a whole bunch of hair. Yeah
[00:32:33] It's yeah, your head's getting blistered
[00:32:36] It's a psychological part of it man that that
[00:32:40] Yeah, I don't know if I'd want to wear a helmet or not actually
[00:32:43] I keep you a little warm, you know, I don't know any other so once you got done with hell week
[00:32:47] You're in the rest of the buds. Was there any other major challenges for you there?
[00:32:51] Um eating dry out at the island
[00:32:53] Would you say eating dry? Yeah, so, you know
[00:32:57] At least one meal a day you had to either do the pull-ups the frog hill run or the rope climb
[00:33:03] What did you suck at something pull-ups?
[00:33:05] Okay, I could not yeah gravity, you know rope climb is fine because you use your legs technique
[00:33:11] But man, I ate wet a lot pull-up day
[00:33:16] It was funny because because for whatever reason I never did pull-ups growing up and uh, yeah, that was uh
[00:33:23] The island was second phase for me. Yeah, uh, then it switched eventually. Yeah, we're back to it. I guess so
[00:33:30] Yeah, eventually. I mean I became a pull-up freak, you know as a big guy, you know, I think uh
[00:33:37] Even after my shoulder surgeries. I did, you know, 26 pull-ups like six months later. It's like it's personal challenge
[00:33:44] But uh, yeah
[00:33:46] So so pull-ups was one, you know running not a great runner, you know swimming, but you know you're swimming, you know, uh
[00:33:54] Yeah
[00:33:56] Not a top performer by any means, uh, but just kept going forward, you know, and uh, you know, just
[00:34:03] All you had to do is perform, you know, um pass, you know, but perform, you know not tying
[00:34:11] um
[00:34:13] Normally no factor
[00:34:15] We did it in the dive tower
[00:34:18] How deep?
[00:34:19] Well the ropes stay the same depth
[00:34:22] The uh 10 feet Zinke took me down to 50 feet
[00:34:28] And we just hung out there and looked at each other
[00:34:31] And uh till he was you know tired
[00:34:35] And then we came up to the top and there is a set
[00:34:39] You know, it's all set what you're supposed to be doing. Uh, and uh
[00:34:44] I was like
[00:34:45] Okay, yeah, you're ready to go. Yeah ready to go. Yeah, you know
[00:34:48] And we went down and uh, and then we we came back up, you know, and bam next knot
[00:34:57] They were back down again and back up and down. So I failed that
[00:35:02] Yeah, uh, you know, that's one thing that's interesting what I remember about some of the breath holding stuff
[00:35:07] Like 50 meter underwater swim you go on a budge. You're like, ah, it's no big deal. I could do that
[00:35:12] but
[00:35:13] And not tying I'll take what's in nine feet go down there tie knot but you're in in buds because of everything that's going on
[00:35:19] You're constantly like beat down. So you almost always have a cough
[00:35:23] You kind of have a cold you kind of have like you guess you're always like that you're always tired like like a four mile time run
[00:35:30] four mile time run
[00:35:32] First phase was 32 minutes four mile time run. You look at that on paper on the outside. You're like, whoa, what's that?
[00:35:38] That's a freaking. Well, you know, I like to do that. No problem
[00:35:40] Then you get in there. You got boots on you got pants on you're running in the soft sand
[00:35:45] And the run is not four miles. It's like 4.2 miles for point four miles 4.5 miles
[00:35:51] right
[00:35:52] And then and and what'd you do the night before the night before that morning four o'clock in the morning four mile time run
[00:35:59] You did, you know, a thousand eight count bodybuilders or you did buddy carries up and down the burn. So everything is
[00:36:05] Harder than it then you think it's going to be in buds. It's not what's on paper. It's what what actually happens is harder
[00:36:13] Yeah, no
[00:36:14] And you didn't get to eat but you had to run to chow and you had to go through the line and touch the hamburger that you want to eat
[00:36:21] Um, but there was no time to actually eat it, you know, you wasted time running all of it
[00:36:25] But you that's what you must go there to do that
[00:36:28] But there's no time to actually sit down and eat and then you run and you go do the evolution because you have to be at the evolution on time
[00:36:33] Did you get rolled for anything? No, no first time every time. Yeah, it's uh, um, well, I mean I fail that but but my lungs were messed up from
[00:36:43] From hell week not times right after hell week. That's that's that's the kind of thing that makes it hard
[00:36:48] He's like you get done with hell week. You're jacked up man
[00:36:50] Right and now you got to go do these knots underwater and you're like you can barely even hold your breath for 10 seconds
[00:36:56] or socks
[00:36:58] And then you get taken down to the bottom. Yeah, you know 50 feet going down to 50 feet is no joke. I mean that's a that's a legit
[00:37:05] That's a legit swim, right?
[00:37:07] Subsurface swim that takes a that takes a decent amount of time just to get down to 50 feet
[00:37:13] Right and now you got to do your little
[00:37:15] Happy time with us right now in the tower. Yeah, the tower was 50. We went to the bottom sat
[00:37:20] Do you see it's gone now the tower? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[00:37:23] Yeah, yeah
[00:37:24] I drove around there just checking everything out and so what are you are you like a seaman?
[00:37:29] Apprentice at this point or just a e3. Yeah. Yeah, it was there happy to be there check. Yeah, I mean
[00:37:35] Knowledge of the navy knowledge of what I'm you know other than I'm signing up
[00:37:40] I'm you know, I'm gonna get to shoot blow things up skydive scuba dive serve my country. Hell. Yeah, you know, uh,
[00:37:47] Let's rock and roll. That's right. Hey, cool
[00:37:49] it uh, you know, they'd like um
[00:37:52] Um
[00:37:54] Pull comp, you know, that was another one where you know, and I had uh, um
[00:38:00] One of the mean instructors
[00:38:02] Uh, uh, uh, and was he a senior chief at the time? Yes, he was
[00:38:06] I know exactly what you're talking about
[00:38:08] Yeah, and uh
[00:38:11] Hey great respect, you know, um
[00:38:14] But he ripped my mask off at the beginning, you know, so basically you got your your you got these old scuba tanks on with
[00:38:20] Uh flexible hoses that you can tie knots into not modern gear. They're actually soft hollow
[00:38:27] Hoses so you can tie knots into them to cut the air off
[00:38:30] uh, and uh
[00:38:32] You know, he takes my mask off and leave but leaves it on my head
[00:38:36] And I said, okay, I'm not gonna put it back on. I'm just gonna keep he's just swim back and forth
[00:38:41] And you get to the end you turn around and while they're doing that they're just coming in on you and wrecking your gear
[00:38:47] And you have to do everything procedurally correct
[00:38:50] And uh, I did everything procedurally correct, but since my mask was accessible
[00:38:55] I should have put it on
[00:38:57] fail
[00:39:00] There you go
[00:39:03] So I had to do that again, uh, uh, and I got even harder instructor. Uh, we considered harder but fair in my mind, you know, uh
[00:39:11] Superdude, but he uh
[00:39:13] um
[00:39:14] Yeah, I got put through the ringer again, but but you know, I put my mask on one day was available
[00:39:20] And uh lesson learned lesson learned. Yeah, I was a whole bunch of learning because I didn't do any of the
[00:39:25] You know, well, they didn't teach you that prehens because that was third phase for me, you know, I've been there, you know
[00:39:31] You know back into shape again
[00:39:33] It takes like a year is what they say to recover from hell week. You look at some of those cats
[00:39:39] um, and I remember, you know, I was
[00:39:41] A class corpsman, you know sending dudes to the hospital with encephalitis, you know, their hands are just, you know
[00:39:48] Big giant puff balls and their feet, you know, uh, it's uh, and we didn't get any sleep in hell week
[00:39:54] You're supposed they're scheduled to sleep, you know, uh
[00:39:58] But we did not get that
[00:39:59] Yeah, I think the scheduled sleep might be a couple hours total something like that
[00:40:04] Yeah, there's two blocks of it and you're supposed to get dry first
[00:40:08] um
[00:40:09] That one I know my class got because
[00:40:12] They you know, they tell you some story like hey the
[00:40:15] The the the skipper said we're being too hard on you guys where we have to stand down for eight hours
[00:40:21] You guys go get dry and you guys can go to bed and we'll wake you up tomorrow
[00:40:26] And I mean, you know, it's bullshit
[00:40:27] But you still you put on dry clothes and then you go and you actually get in your bed
[00:40:33] And this is probably probably tuesday. Yeah, and and then you know
[00:40:36] A half an hour later they come in and they get you up and hit the surf and right
[00:40:41] But but guys quit because it's it's a smart move to get people to quit
[00:40:44] Oh, yeah, because they go into the comfort zone, right?
[00:40:47] And then they bring you back out, you know, you gotta watch out for that comfort zone, bro
[00:40:50] That they go grab a hold of you. Oh, yeah, that's like when you're doing a long rock march. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[00:40:55] If you stop you got to stop for like
[00:40:57] Five minutes eight minutes 10 minutes at the most then you got to get your ass up and start walking again because
[00:41:02] You start going into that 15 minute break 20 minute break your body gets cold and you're screwed getting back up
[00:41:10] But uh, yeah, so I we slept that point and you know, you fall sometimes you're just falling asleep
[00:41:16] I mean, there's nothing you can do about it. You're gonna fall asleep. Yeah, the uh, so they got us into dry clothes
[00:41:23] And we had a kid in our class that um quit on tuesday, you know
[00:41:29] Whatever 20 class or whatever, you know years before came back and uh, so he had knowledge up to tuesday
[00:41:40] And so we kind of you know, he knew something about that
[00:41:43] So we got dry, but then they put us on the grinder
[00:41:46] and uh on the pavement where we worked out and you know, we started doing flutter kicks and uh
[00:41:53] Instructors up there doing our flutter kicks. He brought the class leader up there
[00:41:57] And uh headed the class leader started leading us and then the instructors walked away
[00:42:03] And we're on our backs. We're in dry clothes. That's the standard
[00:42:08] um
[00:42:09] class leader would not let us go to sleep
[00:42:12] it's like
[00:42:14] Yeah, I go, you know, he's trying to go around making us say our social security numbers or birthdays
[00:42:18] You know trying to keep everybody awake and it's like
[00:42:21] I go and I'm
[00:42:23] I am a kid
[00:42:24] You know, I go you're doing the job for them
[00:42:31] And uh
[00:42:33] So then they at the end because they they're you know in that first phase corner office
[00:42:40] Just giggling I I imagine you know, uh, and then they uh, let us you know said I they're probably trying to figure out how to make that officer quit
[00:42:48] Yeah
[00:42:50] They weren't gonna make that guy quit that guy's a haas
[00:42:53] He's doing the underwater swim you gotta swim you gotta swim tight up
[00:42:59] Um, and you gotta do a flip into the water and then you swim 25 meters flip and then turn around and come back
[00:43:06] Without a mask on
[00:43:09] So he did it flutter kicking
[00:43:11] Damn
[00:43:12] Yeah, no, no, no, this is not not the tight up one the one you just the water swing the 100 meter
[00:43:17] Um tight up one, you know, uh, but but you have a mask on I think on that one
[00:43:23] Uh, but the other one you didn't have a mask. He's flutter kicking it and he swam off course
[00:43:29] Finally got back on course made it there and back
[00:43:32] It hard hard hard to stone. Yeah, uh college football player, you know, uh, but
[00:43:39] Yeah, so they put us put us to bed and um
[00:43:42] Um, somebody had a watch hidden you're not allowed to have a watch you have no concept of time or day or anything
[00:43:48] Uh, and uh, you're always trying to figure out what day it is a little bit, you know, uh, you know
[00:43:55] Trying to remember what meal you count for meal to meal basically
[00:43:58] um
[00:43:59] And uh, yeah, so 22 minutes. That's what we got for hell week
[00:44:03] Of sleep. It's not a lot of sleep
[00:44:05] Oh legit, so you graduate from buds and what did you want to go where did you end up going team three?
[00:44:14] You went to team three, right? Yeah, I went to team three
[00:44:16] So you get the dream sheet and you know, I put like all I wanted to go to Maine because I I love the snow and
[00:44:24] And it was like
[00:44:25] Start goes. Yeah. No, you can't do that
[00:44:27] That's stupid because you can't you got to go to a team first, you know, we have four billets up there in Maine
[00:44:32] That's how I eventually got up there. Uh, but I put team. I want to do cold weather. I want to put team two
[00:44:37] um, you know, I
[00:44:39] Put team four. I don't remember what else I put but you put all east coast teams
[00:44:43] I think so and the navy said west coast shielding three
[00:44:50] And uh, you know, I had a great time there, uh, you know, um
[00:44:53] Um, first platoon that you know, um mark muck crampton bob edwards, you know, um folks that you remember, you know, uh, miss mark, you know
[00:45:02] Mark was friggin awesome, man. Yeah, dude. Uh crazy. You know, we can talk about that just a whole
[00:45:08] We got to watch uh mark mark, you know, say it, you know committed suicide and uh, completely unexpected totally
[00:45:15] I mean that dude was solid as stone. Yeah, it's just an awesome mentor to so many people. I mean mentor
[00:45:21] Yeah, wow
[00:45:24] A smile on his face
[00:45:26] Every single time
[00:45:28] I interacted with him which was sometimes on a daily basis, but I mean for his whole career
[00:45:34] He just always had a good attitude about everything right about everything that was going on
[00:45:39] And yeah, so totally unexpected. You know, he retired. He's been retired. He had been retired for
[00:45:45] quite a few years
[00:45:47] maybe
[00:45:48] What do you think five years seven years something like that something like that? Yeah, I mean he kept on just
[00:45:53] Moving on up and doing good things for the teams and and everybody around him. I mean always uh self motivated
[00:46:01] Self improvement guy always looking for that next thing to make him and everybody around
[00:46:05] Yeah, and helping uh, I'm not not just the teams or he would like help kids that were wrestling had like a wrestling club
[00:46:10] He's just doing everything right. Yeah
[00:46:13] no, but yeah, that was that was uh, uh
[00:46:16] That was a great platoon
[00:46:17] you know, uh west back, you know did uh
[00:46:21] So where'd you deploy to the pi or'd you go? Where'd you go? P. I um, p. I
[00:46:26] Penotubo hit
[00:46:28] Oh, you know just after we left and we came back. I came back with foxtrot platoon
[00:46:34] And uh, you know the ashes everywhere
[00:46:37] So you weren't in the pi when penitubo hit. No. No, I was not
[00:46:41] You came how was the work up and everything your first platoon being a new guy
[00:46:44] Uh, what oh, yeah, oh you were a corman. I was a corman taking the hits, you know, uh
[00:46:50] We had a good bunch of new guys
[00:46:53] You know, uh, yeah, gino bam bam
[00:46:58] We can ghost man dave casper lost him to cancer
[00:47:01] Recently, I don't remember these guys were still around there at the time
[00:47:06] Yeah
[00:47:08] Just a good yeah, uh, but legit, you know we
[00:47:11] You
[00:47:13] You make a mistake as a as a new guy back then, you know, you're gonna pay for it. I really didn't get too much grief
[00:47:20] I mean one day out at niland, you know with the old niland, you know with the trio woe and uh,
[00:47:26] they were they were, you know, uh
[00:47:29] Tune in some folks up. I was on watch, you know, it was untouchable
[00:47:33] Dave the ghost man Casper
[00:47:35] Um, they were going after him and they chased him
[00:47:39] He got up on top of the mill bands and the rsu's that were over by the fence
[00:47:44] And that's there's a gap big enough to drive a semi tractor trailer and unload it
[00:47:49] He jumped over that barb wire and made it out into the desert and spent the night up freedom freedom
[00:47:59] Right on and then so what'd you do on deployment back then, uh, you know, I I deployed training, you know, uh fed, uh,
[00:48:06] You know, did you go to any cool countries?
[00:48:08] Yeah, uh, I had a blast in, you know, South Korea, um, you know, we went to Japan did some sub ops there. We did, uh
[00:48:17] Shoot where else did we go?
[00:48:19] I mean, there wasn't a whole bunch of traveling, you know
[00:48:22] Golf kicked off we deployed early
[00:48:25] You know, I did not we didn't do did you backfill someone that went to the golf or something
[00:48:28] Yeah, yeah, uh seal team five worst job ever in the teams. Hey, we just need you to backfill for the guys that are going to war
[00:48:34] You're like, no
[00:48:35] So yeah, I missed out, uh, you know
[00:48:37] Well significant parts of the work up, you know as a new guy too, you know and as a corpsman
[00:48:44] Back then we didn't have the training that they got now
[00:48:47] You know, and I could have got some more of that, you know, uh, but I mean the first stitches I ever
[00:48:52] ever did other than on a
[00:48:55] You know, uh
[00:48:56] fruit
[00:48:59] Was my own knee
[00:49:01] Workup out of niland and they had, uh
[00:49:03] Uh a pistol course we were running there was a pipe you had to crawl through that had bullet holes in it
[00:49:08] and uh, you know, you know dug on my knee and you know, I
[00:49:12] I never even
[00:49:14] used lidocaine because
[00:49:16] I wasn't I taught that in core school
[00:49:19] You know, and I hadn't been through
[00:49:21] Um the empty course where you got all that
[00:49:24] Yeah at this point in the work up and so
[00:49:28] A whole platoon watching me because I'm the doc in the platoon
[00:49:31] Um and uh, which again was just crazy wrong, you know from what they get a platoon guy now had more training
[00:49:38] The regular platoon guy now has more than than what I had there so squirt away and uh, you know
[00:49:43] I never tied a knot on a human, you know a stitch and so
[00:49:47] everybody's watching
[00:49:49] And uh, you know figured it out
[00:49:52] Yeah, herk herk herk doc. Uh, yeah doc herk was you know supervising me and uh,
[00:50:00] I figured it out, you know
[00:50:03] Cleaned it cleaned it out myself
[00:50:06] and that was you know, but
[00:50:09] They were you know, we came back second platoon. We were like getting ready to get uh,
[00:50:13] Corazon Aquinas out, you know 92 time frame 91 92 and that was
[00:50:20] That was a fun little, uh, you know
[00:50:22] Jump into the deployment. We jumped into doing that and you you've done the quick ducks where you're uh, um
[00:50:28] In recoveries where you're driving right into the back of a 47. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we were doing in the back of 53s
[00:50:36] That's why I wrote her. Yeah. How's that work? That's gotta be sketchy
[00:50:40] Especially when you're by yourself, but I you know
[00:50:43] Um, what are they like? Hey, you got this you drive it in there. We'll we'll wait
[00:50:48] Yeah, so so we you know, everybody goes out and uh, no big deal, you know, but they're um, it's uh
[00:50:54] It's fully inflated just about or it was a
[00:50:59] Drive take everybody on shore and then recover back onto the same helo by yourself
[00:51:04] It's 240 not rotor wash
[00:51:07] from uh
[00:51:08] A 53. Yeah, so echo just to explain what he's talking about
[00:51:12] So a ch 53 is a big giant helicopter
[00:51:16] But you ever seen the helicopters that have two big rotors on top, right? That's what we would normally do this on
[00:51:22] Well, that's called a 47 or a 46 is a little small but a 47 is big
[00:51:28] But the 53 has a tail rotor like a normal helicopter. So when you drive in the back
[00:51:34] You're coming close to this thing for sure. Oh, yeah. No, you come in you're coming in at a 45
[00:51:41] Um, and you've got to make sure your your engine's on tilt
[00:51:44] You're coming in at a 45 to void the tail rotor. Um, because that's legit
[00:51:48] Uh, again that rotor wash can flip that boat. I put anything extra in it, uh into the bow of the boat
[00:51:55] And I would lean forward and holding on to the tiller it leaning forward into the boat
[00:51:59] You punch through that and it's a wall when you get through it. There's dead space
[00:52:03] So so you you've got a you got to make a right hand turn
[00:52:08] And gun it one more time until you're and you're in you're inside the helicopter
[00:52:12] It's like by yourself. It's pretty wild to do
[00:52:14] Um, and as a new guy, I mean this is my second platoon
[00:52:18] Uh, without a workup. So that was that was pretty wild and that whole so that those were air force spec ops guys
[00:52:25] And I know there was their big, uh
[00:52:28] Thing and it was uh, yeah, we did exercise with those guys too in the philippines. Um, you know the uh
[00:52:36] The c-130 that they had
[00:52:38] um, it got shot by
[00:52:40] You know npa or some farmer didn't like flying to serve in their jack or what you know, whatever
[00:52:47] Uh, uh, and uh, so it it took a round through and through the plane
[00:52:52] We never knew they they landed it patched it is their exercise and that thing was back up in the air
[00:52:59] When when an air force bird, you know breaks
[00:53:03] Um, and it's in a nice place like hawaii
[00:53:06] You're there for a couple days
[00:53:08] We never knew it even got hit. Yeah, you know, and this is training again. I'm not you know, it's uh
[00:53:14] um, yeah, that was that was
[00:53:16] Pretty wild now this didn't you fall somehow like a oh, yeah, what was that all about?
[00:53:22] ouch just um, so
[00:53:25] I always went off to uh, um, josh woodtree
[00:53:30] Or I had a while to go climbing on the weekends, you know, uh, Lou Langlis, you know talk. We were all in a
[00:53:35] Um
[00:53:37] Andy rios lou, um, who else was in the barracks? Um, you know
[00:53:43] Go off climbing on the weekends, you know, we were still in the barracks and the teams at that time
[00:53:48] Um, and so, you know off camping
[00:53:53] And I was a pretty decent climber right off the bat
[00:53:55] You know, my uncle up in canada would take me climbing
[00:53:58] And uh once in a while as a kid and uh, rarely but um, I just liked it and uh
[00:54:05] I went up there. No one no one could go climbing with me. So not cool. I just go find somebody when I get up there
[00:54:11] so
[00:54:12] I had the soloist, you know, it's a self-bolay device you tie off to the bottom and as you progress you keep putting
[00:54:18] Um pro in it's a camping unit. Um, and I did like a 5-8 and I funny. I remember the names of the climbs because
[00:54:24] I was like, uh, uh, Mike's books. It's on intersection rock right there in uh, in joshua tree
[00:54:30] And then I just hung dog this I got to the top set up a top rope
[00:54:35] Making it safer. Uh, and I just did like a Mike's books like a 5-8 and then the next one was like a 5-11
[00:54:43] Which is above my what I could do. I was a 10c ish climber
[00:54:47] Um, so I just kind of cheated my way up on that literally, you know, because you can you can hang on your pro
[00:54:52] Hang on your whatever. Yeah, well, you just pull on your rope a little bit because it's I'm self-bolaying top rope again. Okay
[00:54:58] Get to the top and and uh, you know, there's uh
[00:55:03] Lady who wants to go climbing with me. I'm like check, you know
[00:55:08] So it's all downhill from there. Yeah, so I throw my rope down and uh, I go do the down climb and I look up
[00:55:16] And there's my rope. It's caught in a crack
[00:55:18] All right, I gotta hurry up. I got the four pieces of pro that I set that top rope up with and
[00:55:26] I climb up there get to the rope put it back through the belay device and when you're when you're using that soloist if you're off track, um
[00:55:35] It drags so I'm in this bowl and there's a uh
[00:55:39] There's an overhang so I gotta reach out and around
[00:55:43] um, and
[00:55:44] I was doing it and it's actually a pretty easy climb is like a five seven
[00:55:49] Um, but I didn't feel comfortable with it and I had no idea what was really up above me. It was really
[00:55:54] It was dumb
[00:55:57] And so I said nope not gonna do it
[00:55:59] So I jumped back into that bowl
[00:56:01] But I took up the slack and that one piece of pro that I set in kept my feet from planting
[00:56:07] Um, but it popped that pro and I flipped out of there backwards and I uh
[00:56:15] You know, I'm 40 feet up
[00:56:17] And I I come against the vertical face
[00:56:21] I palm the rock broke my left wrist
[00:56:23] um tucked into a
[00:56:25] Good plf and I landed in this standstone wash and it
[00:56:30] Folded me like a book separated both my shoulders
[00:56:33] Um chipped my ankle and whatever else
[00:56:37] Um, that was a train wreck
[00:56:39] Um, and there was a class for guides just uh
[00:56:45] 100 feet away and they got me the rest of the way down or they didn't have a part to go and uh
[00:56:51] I called, you know, and
[00:56:53] Ranger said hey, you know
[00:56:56] We've had a lot of people fall from there
[00:56:58] They either land here in the sand because if I went if I would have pushed off a little bit further
[00:57:03] I would have landed in the sand probably wouldn't have been happy either
[00:57:06] Um, and he said yeah, they usually live in the land over here or they land where you do and they don't
[00:57:12] Uh, just by chance I landed right in the middle of the wash. I was tucked into a tight plf parachute landing fall
[00:57:17] Um, you know just not recent graduate of uh, because this is my this is before my first platoon. Okay
[00:57:23] I was not gonna not deploy
[00:57:26] um, so
[00:57:27] I didn't want to go to 29 palms and get stuck out there. I called Gina whoop. Gina came pick me up
[00:57:34] and uh, was another team guy and uh, you know, so yeah, just dropped me off at Balboa
[00:57:38] I'll get it, you know, and they you know did a couple, you know
[00:57:42] Basically you get into going to Balboa on a saturday night
[00:57:45] What do you got there a whole bunch of colds a whole bunch of you know
[00:57:49] That's what they have for an option to get their kids taken care of and uh
[00:57:53] And go up to the nurse. You're gonna say when I've had to go Balbo
[00:57:56] I'm like a sat depending on what time it's like saturday at two o'clock in the morning
[00:58:00] It's like drunk sailors that are gotten fights beat up. It's like such a disaster. No, this this is this is early
[00:58:08] Our late evening. Yeah, so you're all right. They haven't gotten drunk enough to get end up in the hospital yet
[00:58:13] Yeah, but but I'm there and uh, uh, the triage nurse, you know says, uh, hey, I'm ed, you know, I'm uh, uh,
[00:58:20] You know, I I fell and I hurt my you know
[00:58:23] I got I'm banged up whatever I said
[00:58:26] It was fill out this clipboard and come back to us
[00:58:29] And my neck is jacked up. I can't turn, you know, and I sit down and I start to think about filling it up
[00:58:36] And I'm looking, you know, I'm looking like this
[00:58:39] You know, I can't turn my head and I go I just stand back up and said ma'am
[00:58:43] Um, I fell 40 feet and a rock fall and my neck hurts. Sir
[00:58:48] Please don't move and they strapped me into a backboard when you know x-rayed my neck, you know, what else hurts, you know
[00:58:55] This is 10 hours after the fall
[00:58:58] Everything hurts
[00:59:00] And they x-rayed me they didn't find anything, you know, they didn't x-ray everything
[00:59:03] There was more things that hurt than than my wrist and my my ankle, you know
[00:59:09] But uh, yeah, um later on I found out so
[00:59:12] I went climbing two weeks later with my this is three weeks before deployment, but I had no strength in my left wrist
[00:59:19] I didn't know why
[00:59:21] And my little brother wanted to go pre-deployment leave we went up to canada went climbing, you know
[00:59:28] young kids
[00:59:29] Drive, but I deployed in
[00:59:32] And I think a total of three weeks. I got acupuncture like the next day because I could not raise my arms above my head
[00:59:37] Uh, you know, but I got acupuncture stuck a needle in my from an acupuncture student in Coronado, so that's good
[00:59:45] It worked. She's you know
[00:59:47] Anyway, yeah, yeah stuck a needle in my hand and my shin and
[00:59:52] All of a sudden I can raise my hands above my head and you know, we went on deployment
[00:59:57] And I had to do we had to do a prt
[01:00:02] And I'll tell you it on camera here I cheated I did not do the pull-ups
[01:00:06] I kind of cycled around but I did the run probably the slowest I ever ran three miles at that point in my life
[01:00:11] but I was able to pass everything and
[01:00:15] um
[01:00:16] Yeah, I so wrestling tournament the fleet comes into town
[01:00:20] and uh
[01:00:22] Carrier group so they all kinds of activities that don't go out in town and cause trouble. You know and uh
[01:00:30] So I'm wrestling in this tournament
[01:00:32] And I I re-agitated the break in my wrist in the first match
[01:00:39] And then in the finals I separated my shoulder
[01:00:43] And uh, I yeah, I bowed out at that time happily took second
[01:00:47] So I kept separating my shoulders like every three months one or left one of the right one left one of the right one
[01:00:53] You know, uh, just a young kid keep moving forward and uh, I was the corpsman
[01:00:58] But I didn't really know a whole bunch. You know, so
[01:01:00] Yeah, keep moving forward keep going. Yeah, so what'd you get do when you got done with that second platoon that team three?
[01:01:07] so
[01:01:09] second but so in between
[01:01:11] uh, those platoons I screened for for dev group. Oh, okay, and uh
[01:01:17] Yeah, they said we don't want you as a corpsman. Can you cross right? I said yes because I didn't want to be a corpsman
[01:01:26] I could have stayed, you know with more training and all that
[01:01:29] Okay, but but I just want to be a you know, arch-eyed team guy
[01:01:32] You had to cover your own evolutions back then and I never did because I always found somebody else to cover them
[01:01:37] You had to work at it though and I said I should not have to work to have someone else cover my platoon evolutions
[01:01:43] That's just the way it used to be from moons ago
[01:01:45] um, and so I screamed positive I jumped right into uh, uh
[01:01:51] Foxtrot platoon
[01:01:53] uh, did that the end of their work up really and then jumped right onto the deployment and uh
[01:01:58] I came back from that and
[01:02:01] young kid, you know, we never did a cqb work up. I made the mistakes I made and uh
[01:02:09] Then it's a you know, so I didn't make it through and then where do you want to go and uh, you know seal team four
[01:02:14] uh, just because the reputation and uh, um, I wanted to get to the east coast
[01:02:21] You know so they I think I put you know two and four and they said they'd give them whatever I wanted
[01:02:25] And I said let's go go to four and you know south america and uh, so I went and did that
[01:02:31] And then you so you show up at team four just back into platoon life. Yep. Um, hey, can you deploy in two weeks?
[01:02:37] check
[01:02:38] Have your uh, are you a six gunner?
[01:02:41] I am now
[01:02:43] So that's your for you're your third platoon if you get assigned as a pig gunner. Yep. Uh, uh, well, I mean
[01:02:48] I mean as a corpsman I wanted to carry the pig medical gear and everything else, you know
[01:02:55] Again happy new guy, but so so yeah, um, you know, I can work the pig and so I went out and uh
[01:03:02] Bought myself some uh, you know 200 round uh pouches
[01:03:07] and uh figured out made some gear up and off to deployment I went um
[01:03:11] And uh, yeah, can you be the diver up? Yeah, I could be the diver up. Uh, uh, you know, I was diving since I was a kid
[01:03:19] You know, um, I died. I think I qualified when I was 15 or 16 very comfortable in the water
[01:03:27] And uh, yeah, so so we I got dengue fever
[01:03:32] Bad deal. Oh, so what's the deal with that? Yeah, um, you know, uh, get bit by a mosquito and uh,
[01:03:41] You know, I got up to 106.5 temperature
[01:03:44] Bad deal, uh, not at that point though. So we were in Panama and I got I didn't know what I had
[01:03:50] I was just trashed, you know, um, just hot spikes
[01:03:55] Um, colds, I mean can't walking outside just go put a piece of mail in the mailbox, you know outside the barracks
[01:04:01] And I'm freezing and it's 98 degrees
[01:04:04] Um, and then you know go back inside the air conditioning and I'm just all of a sudden, you know, just up and down and up and down
[01:04:10] But then I got better
[01:04:12] So there's a trip to Colombia
[01:04:16] Can I get on there? Yeah, throw them on the bird
[01:04:19] When we landed in Barranquilla
[01:04:24] And they literally kicked our pallet off at the end of the runway because it was a very hot area
[01:04:28] Um, it just hit again, you know, I got better for like a couple of days and um,
[01:04:35] We got
[01:04:37] Can't trace a scheme or something
[01:04:39] Uh, the town we're in
[01:04:41] And my fever got up to 106.5 and uh, you know, it was the other new guy Corbin. I wasn't a Corbin anymore
[01:04:48] But uh, it's like, you feel good. I think I'll get better a little bit, you know, but yeah, I was iced in
[01:04:54] Luckily we were there with the SBU guys and uh
[01:04:59] Um, they brought an air conditioner, you know, we put an air conditioner in the building. We're in we're talking one dirt road town
[01:05:04] You know that tees into the river
[01:05:06] And uh, yeah, that was uh, does dengue fever stick with you for the rest of your life like uh,
[01:05:12] Not not you don't get this. Um, if you get it again, it's supposed to be really really bad. Uh, but no, it's not like malaria
[01:05:20] Um, but man, it takes forever to recover. So on that treasure month-long trip
[01:05:27] Um, so this is why I don't like freaking travel, bro. I'll stay right here. Well, I don't like leaving America
[01:05:32] My wife's always like, hey, let's go to this place. I might know. Well, how about you want to go somewhere?
[01:05:37] Panama's how about freaking northern california? How about, you know, how about we go to tecula?
[01:05:41] How does that sound? Yeah, she wants to go to some foreign place?
[01:05:45] Bro, I did all that. Yeah, and I didn't get dengue fever and I don't want to get it. No, I mean bad deal. Um,
[01:05:50] From from from seal team four. I've known somebody who's had everything like leachmen isis. Yeah, so back in the day
[01:05:57] In in the 90s. Well, even before that the teams were geographically oriented. So
[01:06:03] Seal team one was southeast asia seal team two was europe seal team three was europe
[01:06:09] Seal team one was southeast asia seal team two was europe seal team three was supposed to be southwest asia seal team four
[01:06:17] was south america
[01:06:18] And seal team four, you know had had done the stuff in panama had lost guys in panama had, you know, the
[01:06:25] The combat experience really right of the of the era
[01:06:29] Um, so I can imagine that probably played into your mindset of wanting to go to team four and and it spanish speakers
[01:06:36] Were going to team four right and I mean there was still, you know
[01:06:41] All the snow cap ops that they were legit doing, you know, whether it was just
[01:06:45] You know, I'm sitting on a mountain top of the radio or getting involved with the da. I mean that was happening
[01:06:51] Um
[01:06:52] And this was one of those gigs where we were going in to train in these folks and then we were going to go in as a radio relay
[01:06:59] Um, so at the end we were going in as a radio relay
[01:07:03] They sent me walked an insane amount and
[01:07:07] um, and I'm the 60 gunner and I've weakest snot from from dengue fever and
[01:07:15] um
[01:07:16] Sun up to sun down we did
[01:07:20] Ridiculous, so it's not it was not through the jungle. It was through the edges of open fields that had all these
[01:07:26] um
[01:07:27] Lava rocks, you know softball size a little bigger smaller
[01:07:31] To get into columbia at that time frame
[01:07:34] The marines controlled the mill group so to get access to the country you had to go through the marines
[01:07:39] Marines are trying to build the river in assault teams or rat teams
[01:07:43] So you had to take a marine fighting force with you, you know
[01:07:47] an 01
[01:07:49] you know uh
[01:07:51] staff sergeant and uh, you know a corporal um, so we
[01:07:55] tagged on and
[01:07:57] Yeah, two stayed back what you had your platoon right so you have a squad and how many guys did you have this was a squad?
[01:08:04] Okay, but but then we had all the sp you guys and we were so we were training the sp you guys was training their folks up
[01:08:10] We were training our folks up and you know, we were in the middle of 30 dudes
[01:08:15] um, you know plus on this uh hike
[01:08:18] Uh, and uh, uh, we never saw anything, you know, uh, we went in dry hole and and back out
[01:08:29] this marine uh lieutenant
[01:08:32] Read a book were seals
[01:08:35] Don't wear socks
[01:08:37] Uh, and uh that dude's feet were cas wrapped
[01:08:41] Just trash
[01:08:43] Yeah, bad bad
[01:08:45] bad deal
[01:08:47] Yeah, how far of a hump was it?
[01:08:50] ridiculous
[01:08:52] It was it was
[01:08:54] It was like 20 clicks we walked from sun before sundown. We did two hours in the daylight
[01:09:00] Through the night and then came up two hours after and we never stopped we got there dry hole turn around go
[01:09:06] You know the foot was open field, you know foot thing like 20k you got to condition your feet
[01:09:11] Oh, yeah, like a lot and then there's some advantages to it because socks hold water
[01:09:17] And if you're like working in the jungle, you can get used to it and you can be a good thing
[01:09:21] But if you roll out for your first time no socks
[01:09:24] Yeah, but but you guys were doing that because they weren't walking anywhere. Yeah, that's that's another thing
[01:09:30] literally, I mean swimming up the edge of the stream or the river
[01:09:36] You know 50
[01:09:38] Tops yards if not 50 feet
[01:09:41] Um doing the hit and back in the water again. There was reason for it. Um that this was known to be a long walk
[01:09:49] And uh, yeah, no his feet were not serviceable
[01:09:55] So you're you're down there. How many platoons do you do you end up doing at team four?
[01:09:59] uh
[01:10:01] Three I know one of the one of these platoons you meet your wife, right?
[01:10:04] Uh in between actually, okay. Well, how'd that go down? Yeah, uh, eod's uh explosive ordinance disposal guy married to uh, uh
[01:10:13] Spanish lady. My lily on it was up in virginia beach
[01:10:16] Uh, learning english
[01:10:19] Okay, and uh
[01:10:20] Yeah, so so I was trying to learn spanish, you know, I took a couple little, you know classes on it, but uh
[01:10:27] um, so I you know
[01:10:29] Yeah, it was perfect. You know, how did she get to become the virginia beach to learn spanish to learn english funny
[01:10:36] She knew uh another team guy's wife
[01:10:40] Um, and it was going to stay with them and it ended up staying with cheese
[01:10:44] uh, branquiseo and uh and his wife and then
[01:10:49] However, uh, uh the od guy and his wife introduced us
[01:10:55] Yeah, and she's from where?
[01:10:56] Venezuela
[01:10:57] Okay. Yep
[01:10:59] So she's got an interesting viewpoint on the way things go down from a governmental perspective
[01:11:04] Yes, she does and see what's happened to her now. She sees it's coming here man. She sees it's coming here and uh
[01:11:11] Um, yeah, we'll get into it later. I'm sure but definitely the big push to do this thing that we're doing now
[01:11:17] Yeah, that's gotta be crazy. Um, so you end up so you end up getting married to her. Yep
[01:11:22] uh
[01:11:23] Yeah, we got married and uh, you know, I was always trying to not get married because I'd like exactly what I do because I was always in a platoon
[01:11:30] you know and
[01:11:32] um, and at this point, you know, um
[01:11:36] Still happy being a platoon our first, you know first six months of marriage was all you know, I was in a platoon. I was on deployment
[01:11:44] Get back from that and
[01:11:48] At that point we still had training
[01:11:51] um
[01:11:52] at the teams and uh
[01:11:55] and so
[01:11:56] Team four it used to just be rotate out do a stint in training and then back
[01:12:01] I mean it was as really a crazy quick handover team four, you know, this is just before we started putting it to the groups
[01:12:08] And team four said no you're in training for 18 months
[01:12:12] Uh, which is right. I didn't have to like it, you know, uh, so I was in training and
[01:12:17] Marops I was like
[01:12:19] You know and and and diving I was like not what I want but but I made
[01:12:25] What I ended up doing with it is training it into, you know, even though there
[01:12:30] we had
[01:12:32] Turnover which was uh, you know minimal turnover of platoons back then too
[01:12:35] So we had a lot of folks could just do things, you know, you could do ops right at the beginning of platoon work up
[01:12:41] It wasn't gonna be perfect, but they'd figure it out. So I took um
[01:12:44] Marops and basically we ended up doing um
[01:12:50] Some down pilots with it, uh and other things we'd
[01:12:54] You know, it was any five and they just needed somebody in there
[01:12:57] They could you know, because what was any live fire in it?
[01:13:00] Although I didn't put it in there
[01:13:02] uh
[01:13:03] with the pat the
[01:13:05] Uh, the guy running that the the diving portion, you know, we were doing some sniper shots with uh diving our gear and doing some pretty complicated, uh, um
[01:13:15] You know, we'd get the
[01:13:18] Coast guard involved or the auxiliary which really is your personal boat, you know
[01:13:22] A bunch of older older dudes that that just wanted to do good with their personal boat and doing indigenous, you know
[01:13:28] We had a blast doing down to north carolina and doing a live fire shot, you know
[01:13:33] Um in town
[01:13:35] um, you know two e-fives you had to bring us a chief on board to
[01:13:39] Um certify the shot with good and safe and all that stuff, but we were just you know, you know, it was good, you know made
[01:13:46] Uh, you know adept winners got involved with it
[01:13:48] He was the the captain of the team captain at the time and he loved it
[01:13:51] And he loved the brief because I was always doing these curve balls in there
[01:13:54] Just not not straight on you get to have a happy successful training mission, you know, there's always a curve ball and I
[01:14:00] He wanted, you know, I briefed it that way and we did it that way and uh, he actually had his brother who's uh, I think uh
[01:14:08] He navy pilot, you know a 14 pilot at the time. I think it'd be the down pilot for us one time
[01:14:15] You know we're doing a bunch of stuff out in town
[01:14:17] um instead of just around the base and then you know
[01:14:22] Turned in rectangles and triangles out in the ocean. We actually were doing ops. We went out to ches light
[01:14:28] You know over the horizon
[01:14:31] Launched off the whole piece
[01:14:34] PCs and over the horizon
[01:14:37] over the beach into back bay and
[01:14:41] All the 75 nautical miles and actually did a pilot recovery
[01:14:46] In the intercoastal waterways on a piece of property that I was going to buy and then later on a property that I bought
[01:14:53] had him do reconnaissance on it
[01:14:55] and uh
[01:14:56] Just try to you know, um
[01:14:58] It wasn't going to be regular old. Yeah more ops. Yeah, that's that's what it takes is guys that are going to take the training
[01:15:04] And just step it up to the next level. It's always awesome. And the next folks took it even higher than that for me
[01:15:10] That's the idea, you know always better better better
[01:15:13] Uh without getting too many crazy drift into it. Then you end up you end up going to dli, right? Yeah. Yeah
[01:15:21] My shoulders are getting really bad. Um, you know, I literally could move
[01:15:25] You know like refrigerator magnets around anymore and uh, so I went out there and rehabbed
[01:15:30] You know, that was the idea rehabs right there on the did you have to get surgery? Yeah, so I
[01:15:35] I I didn't get soldiers. Yeah, they wouldn't do it. Um
[01:15:39] I wanted to do it right off that deployment
[01:15:42] And um, they wouldn't do it. They wanted me to do rehab first
[01:15:46] And I got orders dli for the basic and the intermediate and I went out there with this is 97 ish
[01:15:52] Uh, uh, something like that. Um, and uh, um
[01:15:59] Yeah, taking her out there without fast computers and these you know phones you can talk to to translate for you
[01:16:04] I mean dli's six and a half hours of Spanish a day every day
[01:16:09] um and four hours of homework a night
[01:16:12] uh and uh
[01:16:14] Legit, I mean I can I I can speak and uh definitely with you know with my mother-in-law living in their house at
[01:16:20] So various points in father-in-law. I mean I got it down and would your wife speak Spanish to you all all the time
[01:16:27] When you got home from dli? Yeah, I mean so she spoke better English
[01:16:32] When we met that I spoke Spanish so our natural language together was English
[01:16:37] Um, it was kind of like the go-to when my brain got tired
[01:16:40] But but uh, yeah for the most part I could say hey, how do you say this?
[01:16:44] You know instead of you know
[01:16:46] Um looking it up in the dictionary and figuring out how to you because you couldn't right now you just talk to your phone
[01:16:51] And I'll tell you so so that was and that was cool
[01:16:55] It takes you about four months to get it to click where you can actually go out and see you know, um
[01:17:03] Yeah, Monterey and and everything else out there
[01:17:06] Um, but man that that that was a great experience and it was just us no kids
[01:17:10] It you know us and a dog when you're speaking when you're speaking Spanish now. Do you think in Spanish?
[01:17:13] I can yeah, yeah, I don't speak it as much as I used to I am we're right now my mother-in-law is living with us
[01:17:20] So it's it's back in the game again
[01:17:22] Uh, because it's she speaking any English. She does it just it's never clicked with her, you know
[01:17:28] I'm she's older and uh, she's always taken the the the classes. I mean
[01:17:34] Genuine effort it's just not clicking, you know, um, but she can't and she can't get along but
[01:17:40] She wants a brain to rest, you know, if you go when you go to a foreign country
[01:17:44] And you are trying to speak in their language to whatever degree you can
[01:17:50] It's tiring
[01:17:52] Um, and uh, I mean I can speak, you know to the Cabo to the corporal and I can speak to the you know, uh,
[01:17:59] Secretary of State uh in Spanish, you know, and I have you know, so it's varying degrees of Spanish, you know, uh,
[01:18:05] What's the MOTJ?
[01:18:09] Ministeria de Justicia and Gobierno. It's like the Secretary of State and uh, Secretary uh, uh, Justice uh,
[01:18:14] All wrapped into one dude and you know as a chief, um, you get to talk to these folks and you're talking about how to
[01:18:22] Develop, you know ranges in Panama or wherever
[01:18:26] But man at the end of the day
[01:18:28] Your brain is tired
[01:18:30] Because all the colloquialisms for the different countries, um,
[01:18:34] They all come into play you say one thing one country that that means something else in another another country
[01:18:38] And you can get yourself in trouble
[01:18:40] You know, but but it's a whole different animal once you get to speak
[01:18:44] Uh, but uh, so the total time at DLI was how was the total time at DLI learned in Spanish?
[01:18:50] Uh, 10 months. Yeah, I graduated the basic class early to because the
[01:18:55] Intermediate class was was going to overlap
[01:18:58] And so I jumped into that and then uh,
[01:19:00] Again, it's just us two and a dog and a cat eventually
[01:19:07] And uh, yeah, um drove back across the country
[01:19:11] And uh said hey my shoulders are trashed so we cut on
[01:19:17] Cut on both shoulders seven weeks apart
[01:19:20] Um, just as I gained enough function with uh, my left hand, um, you know, they did the right one or whichever one it was
[01:19:28] Um, and I've had it tuned up since I had another one done a few years ago. Um,
[01:19:32] Yeah, it's uh, it's an ongoing problem
[01:19:36] And we're and then obviously you go back to team four after you get done with DLI
[01:19:40] I went back to team four, um, and uh,
[01:19:43] Yeah, I went into uh, you're a chief now. No, uh, no, um
[01:19:48] First class maybe first class. Okay. No second class. I was not
[01:19:53] Not a rate grabber. I was not a
[01:19:55] I was happy where I was. I mean, I it was, um, happy with the leadership, you know, and uh,
[01:20:00] I'm not always completely happy, but uh, I always say it. Um,
[01:20:04] Yeah, you know, you really shouldn't be if you're happy with what's going on. Hey, uh, and it's working your team. Um,
[01:20:11] Be happy with it. Uh, but when you finally decide at the end that you're not happy with it. It's kind of too late
[01:20:19] So you're an e5 and now you go back to the team
[01:20:23] for and then jumping into another platoon your shoulders healed healed up enough. Um,
[01:20:29] So
[01:20:30] I was an echo platoon knowing that I was going to get the surgery. They were a, uh, a cd counter drug platoon, you know doing stuff
[01:20:37] mostly in the Caribbean and, um, the mass chief said, yeah, hey, we broke you. We'll fix you. And it was just the with the idea. Hey, um,
[01:20:43] You know ed squared away. He'll do the paperwork whatever stick in the background.
[01:20:46] And you know, he's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy.
[01:20:51] I let me do the paperwork whatever stick in the background. I got theßer surgery done you get a month. Um
[01:20:57] Congolese, lean and I, you know, uh, I literally
[01:21:01] I did the surgeries without any anesthesia. Just just the, um, the nerve block
[01:21:06] Off the table and went
[01:21:08] To the team, you know to to give them whatever paperwork and check him without I was just an you know, I was excited
[01:21:14] the chief said that and I never took leave.
[01:21:19] I just wanted to get signed up to start my physical therapy.
[01:21:22] I did physical therapy twice a day at work.
[01:21:26] Our medical's right in the middle of the compound
[01:21:30] and I'd get a full session
[01:21:33] and then I would get like a partial session
[01:21:36] and then I brought my wife in.
[01:21:38] They taught her how to do all the exercises.
[01:21:41] I built a pulley at home, you know,
[01:21:43] to pull my arm up and down, I built a finger board
[01:21:45] so you can climb the wall with your fingers
[01:21:48] and I mean, six months, you know, I did the PRT
[01:21:53] and legit though, you know, they cut,
[01:21:55] so they did a fully open, they did rock blazes
[01:22:00] the same week, same doctor and they did his,
[01:22:03] they scoped his but mine were pretty much
[01:22:07] kind of collar bones were tent stakes
[01:22:08] and you know, kind of big piece of cauliflower
[01:22:12] so you wanted to get his big hands in there
[01:22:14] and trim them down.
[01:22:15] They remove your deltoid and I'm awake
[01:22:19] and they have a Makita drill check
[01:22:23] and they drill two holes at 90 degrees of each other
[01:22:26] and then lasso that thing entire deltoid back down.
[01:22:30] So it's because they want to get in there and see it all
[01:22:34] and six months later PRT with, you know,
[01:22:39] a very stern master chief there,
[01:22:42] that's very strict on pull ups.
[01:22:46] Yeah, 26 pull ups, 105 push ups,
[01:22:49] the whole swim and everything.
[01:22:50] So you were pretty much good to go six months later.
[01:22:53] Yeah, I mean, I was tuned up and ready to go
[01:22:56] and yeah, into the platoon, you know,
[01:22:59] I even built before all the cool Connick's
[01:23:04] box workout boxes, I went over to SDV
[01:23:07] and got them to weld some stuff up, weld the bench,
[01:23:10] they would collapse up and fit in one of those ISU 90s,
[01:23:13] you know, built to pull apart
[01:23:15] and go across the doors when you open it.
[01:23:18] And should have patented that stuff.
[01:23:20] Yeah, buddy, hey, you know, team guys are pretty innovative.
[01:23:23] You know, Dane, a guy in my second platoon,
[01:23:26] you know, he kind of invented the camelback, you know.
[01:23:32] But what did he use, like an IV bag or something?
[01:23:34] He used a two quart collapsible canteen and an IV tube,
[01:23:40] you know, and had it on his back.
[01:23:42] But hey, you know, you can,
[01:23:44] it's cool to come up with the idea.
[01:23:46] There's innovation, you know,
[01:23:48] inventives and innovation, you gotta get it to market.
[01:23:50] Yeah, well, there's the other's execution too,
[01:23:52] because you gotta be able to actually do it,
[01:23:53] you actually make it happen.
[01:23:55] I always, you know, this sounds so obvious now,
[01:24:00] but I was a radio man, right?
[01:24:02] And so when I was carrying the radio,
[01:24:03] I was gonna have my little flashlights
[01:24:05] and do regular AA flashlights, little AA flashlights.
[01:24:08] You put the red lens over them, you tape them all up.
[01:24:10] So you'd be like a little pinhole of light.
[01:24:13] Right, right, right, right.
[01:24:14] But still you gotta worry about the batteries.
[01:24:16] I mean, you go like on a four day recon,
[01:24:19] your batteries are gonna, so it's a pain.
[01:24:21] And I remember looking at the pilots with their lip lights,
[01:24:25] just the little LEDs, and thinking, wow,
[01:24:28] I wonder what that thing is.
[01:24:29] And then by the time the war started,
[01:24:32] someone made those little just LED click flashlights,
[01:24:35] I was like, oh, that's the smartest thing ever.
[01:24:37] Yeah.
[01:24:38] And I had two ideas in my freaking head,
[01:24:42] and they didn't connect together to say, hey man,
[01:24:46] it's real obvious, here's a cool little flashlight
[01:24:49] you could use and make it into like something
[01:24:51] everybody could carry.
[01:24:52] Yeah, you know, until somebody comes up
[01:24:56] with the limpid backpack,
[01:24:58] team guys were swimming with these bomb, with magnets
[01:25:02] on their hands.
[01:25:04] I've seen the drawings of that.
[01:25:06] Rico, he invented the limpid backpack.
[01:25:13] Simple idea.
[01:25:16] A backpack with a metal plate in it
[01:25:19] that you stuck this limpid explosive mine on it,
[01:25:22] and you would swim with it on your back.
[01:25:24] It seems so obvious.
[01:25:25] It's so obvious because somebody invented it.
[01:25:28] The chest seal, the Ashman chest seal,
[01:25:30] this team guy invented that.
[01:25:31] Yeah, the Ashman, yeah.
[01:25:32] Made this thing that everybody carries now.
[01:25:35] It seems kind of obvious, but you know,
[01:25:38] everybody was happy with a glove.
[01:25:39] Yeah, like a credit card.
[01:25:41] Or a credit E-I-D card.
[01:25:42] A credit E-I-D card, that's what I always tell it as an EMT.
[01:25:45] Yeah, what a brilliant thing.
[01:25:46] Yeah.
[01:25:49] Not everybody comes up, well,
[01:25:50] sometimes you come up with a great idea.
[01:25:51] So you made your ISU 90, you're out there,
[01:25:54] you're ready to work out of a box.
[01:25:56] Yeah, and back with a platoon again, tuned up.
[01:26:00] And you guys are doing counter drug.
[01:26:03] What was that deployment like?
[01:26:05] So it was just a bunch of little deployments.
[01:26:07] They had the CD money, you know,
[01:26:09] and then you named everything you bought
[01:26:10] was a counter drug stapler, you know, a cow.
[01:26:13] Ha ha ha ha ha.
[01:26:16] You know, it was a different pot of money,
[01:26:18] and you're going down, and...
[01:26:19] You're doing recon's.
[01:26:21] What are you doing?
[01:26:21] No, we're just working with the locals.
[01:26:23] It's really fit for an internal defense, really.
[01:26:26] Just getting them tuned up and some huge exercises.
[01:26:32] We would island hop for some of them.
[01:26:34] And, you know, the Army has more commission ships
[01:26:39] than the Navy, which is pretty wild.
[01:26:42] Our Army's a big machine, you know.
[01:26:45] Is it still like that?
[01:26:47] I don't know, someone said it's not.
[01:26:49] And I, no desire to confirm it or not,
[01:26:51] but it's just a wild stat.
[01:26:53] They have more helicopters than the Air Force.
[01:26:55] I mean, they're a monster.
[01:26:56] They're huge.
[01:26:57] The big green machine.
[01:26:58] So we would island hop on their LSU-2000,
[01:27:05] the big giant landing craft,
[01:27:08] and we'd get off there and go stay in a hotel
[01:27:10] and go teach, you know.
[01:27:11] And then another year we went to Belize,
[01:27:14] and they had us staying in the middle of a soccer field
[01:27:18] with countries, you know,
[01:27:20] and a line of outhouses, not as nice.
[01:27:25] Belize the islands, you know,
[01:27:26] vacation land, inland, different animal.
[01:27:30] And that was wild.
[01:27:32] You know, there were some countries
[01:27:34] that did not want to be there.
[01:27:36] They just wanted the gear,
[01:27:37] and they weren't there because they were told.
[01:27:38] And, you know, that was like a hurricane disaster,
[01:27:43] giant exercise where, you know,
[01:27:46] terrorists take over the local school
[01:27:48] while, you know, everything's going on.
[01:27:49] And a huge monster exercise.
[01:27:53] My first bout with Killer B's, you know.
[01:27:57] Have you ever seen a swarm of Killer B's?
[01:28:01] I think I've, no, actually no.
[01:28:04] I've driven, remember in San Diego for a while,
[01:28:07] Echo Charles, there was like bees?
[01:28:09] Like so.
[01:28:09] Yeah.
[01:28:10] I've driven through some swarms of bees, you know.
[01:28:13] And I don't know if it was quite the murder,
[01:28:14] wasp, or whatever those things were.
[01:28:16] But no, I've not dealt with actual legit Killer B's, no.
[01:28:20] Cloud just coming across.
[01:28:22] And yeah, one guy just screamed,
[01:28:25] get in the vehicle or lay down flat.
[01:28:28] And this cloud came over the entire field
[01:28:31] and then just went away.
[01:28:32] It was the craziest thing.
[01:28:33] Did anyone get attacked?
[01:28:35] No one got hit, significant that I remember.
[01:28:37] It was just the weirdest thing.
[01:28:40] But that happened.
[01:28:40] So they weren't really living up to the rep.
[01:28:42] No.
[01:28:44] We were in, we were in Columbia once,
[01:28:46] and actually doing, you know, kind of something, you know,
[01:28:51] going in, you know, and the locals sat down on a hive,
[01:28:59] an underground, you know, ground hive,
[01:29:01] and jumped up and ran and left all their guns.
[01:29:06] And I don't, you know, literally,
[01:29:08] I mean, it was horrible.
[01:29:09] It was a cloud again.
[01:29:11] And we're in a bad spot, actually.
[01:29:14] You can't be without your gun.
[01:29:18] And so I've got-
[01:29:19] Unless you're getting attacked by bees,
[01:29:20] then you said hell with it anyway.
[01:29:22] But it's also where these guys live.
[01:29:25] Yeah.
[01:29:26] You know, I mean, it's just, yeah,
[01:29:29] just outside of Cartagena,
[01:29:32] they take the mother ship down,
[01:29:34] that's, you know, it's a sandbagged, big giant ferry,
[01:29:39] and they take it down and in and go in,
[01:29:40] and it's bad guy land.
[01:29:43] Don't drop your gun.
[01:29:44] But they did.
[01:29:46] And so I've got my beekeeper's hat that I, you know,
[01:29:49] when you want to relax in the jungle,
[01:29:51] you throw that beekeeper's hat on,
[01:29:52] it's your turn to relax.
[01:29:53] It's so nice.
[01:29:54] Yeah.
[01:29:55] Don't like breathing the air back in on me,
[01:29:57] but hey, I'll take it, you know,
[01:29:59] and I've got my gloves and I got the, you know,
[01:30:02] the tips cut off of index finger and thumb and middle finger.
[01:30:07] And so Ed's gonna go get the guns.
[01:30:10] And I've got my hands clenched, hiding those little exposures.
[01:30:15] As soon as I reached out to grab one of the rifles,
[01:30:19] I got whack, whack, whack, whack.
[01:30:20] It was a great, they are just honed in.
[01:30:24] And we spoke the area too,
[01:30:25] to kind of try and calm them down.
[01:30:26] The idea was, I don't know how much it worked, but yeah,
[01:30:30] legit, not cool.
[01:30:35] So what happens, you get done with Appletune.
[01:30:37] So I got to fix my error, you know,
[01:30:41] and I'm going back to Green Team.
[01:30:44] And yeah, a lot going on in the household at that time.
[01:30:49] I was building a house,
[01:30:52] and I had drafting in like half a semester in ninth grade.
[01:30:57] So I drew the complete plans to a house.
[01:31:00] And yeah, not a great plan.
[01:31:05] The house plan was great.
[01:31:07] Green Team planned not so much.
[01:31:09] Not at the same time.
[01:31:10] Her dad was sick in the house.
[01:31:11] So our first child was being born all at the same time.
[01:31:17] And we're out at Shaw's doing a CQB.
[01:31:21] And everybody's taking a nap,
[01:31:23] and I'm talking to the plumber who's trying
[01:31:25] to put a bathroom in the closet, literally.
[01:31:31] The city held us up back because the city employees
[01:31:36] disagreed with the guy with PhD in dirt
[01:31:39] and said the septic field had to be this.
[01:31:41] And so it held everything back.
[01:31:43] And I'm doing this, I got 110 days leave
[01:31:47] that I took to do this thing.
[01:31:48] And I'm doing it in blocks.
[01:31:50] You know, I'm relinquishing, you know,
[01:31:53] what I'm doing, it's tilting for,
[01:31:55] and just set a trip up, do the trip,
[01:32:02] take two weeks of leave,
[01:32:05] and just knocking it out.
[01:32:07] Cause I'm talking, I'm digging the foundation.
[01:32:09] You know, I've cut trees down, milled the trees.
[01:32:12] I built the cabinets.
[01:32:14] I built from scratch the stairwell.
[01:32:16] You know, all the cabinets, all the window trim
[01:32:19] on the first and second floor.
[01:32:22] It cost 180-ish thousand to build it,
[01:32:25] and it appraised for 720.
[01:32:28] I sold it the next year when I'm up in,
[01:32:32] or several years later.
[01:32:33] So I refinanced it when I moved to Maine
[01:32:37] cause I didn't want to have two home loans.
[01:32:40] And yeah, so I did the refi for 720,
[01:32:44] sold it the next year for 610.
[01:32:47] Put it on the market that day,
[01:32:48] and sold it in a day, half a day.
[01:32:52] So I did very well with the house,
[01:32:54] but smashing everything together,
[01:32:56] Green Team and Tommy being born.
[01:32:58] And yeah, I went home to see him.
[01:33:02] He actually heard his birth over the phone,
[01:33:05] and then flew in to make sure everything's all good.
[01:33:10] I was supposed to try and be there,
[01:33:12] but on the plane, pre-911.
[01:33:16] Yeah, not a great plan.
[01:33:20] But it worked out.
[01:33:22] So where'd you go after that?
[01:33:23] SDV-2.
[01:33:24] Did you want to go to SDV?
[01:33:26] Yeah, we were told we were going to be the snipers
[01:33:29] for all group two.
[01:33:31] And yeah, you said you heard that too.
[01:33:36] Got to tell all the group two first.
[01:33:39] All kinds of interesting things.
[01:33:41] Yeah, you know, SDV's awesome.
[01:33:43] Went to the SDV school,
[01:33:45] which everybody there gets qualified to drive that.
[01:33:49] And even though the plan was to be in the back,
[01:33:53] just to get out of it and go do something and come back.
[01:33:55] But it was neat to go to the school, learn all of that.
[01:34:01] I did a platoon there, the war kicked off.
[01:34:05] And we ended up, no one from the East Coast was going.
[01:34:11] We deployed with Team Two, and I think they sent a squad.
[01:34:16] At four, they sent a squad to Afghanistan.
[01:34:20] And no one was going.
[01:34:23] And we went to Kosovo.
[01:34:25] And we were doing reconnaissance there.
[01:34:27] Some of us were a little sketchy.
[01:34:29] We were getting to use some cameras and do some things.
[01:34:31] We were looking for specific people.
[01:34:34] Some of it was walking around town, playing closed,
[01:34:37] which we really hadn't had anything at that point
[01:34:40] to just be a team guy in a foreign country.
[01:34:45] That was easy enough.
[01:34:47] Were you at SDV when September 11th happened?
[01:34:51] Yes.
[01:34:52] 600 yard line getting out of the van
[01:34:54] at Sniper School.
[01:34:58] You were going through Sniper School?
[01:35:00] Yep.
[01:35:01] So when you heard that SDV was gonna be a Sniper's
[01:35:04] for everybody, you said, oh, if I go there,
[01:35:06] I can go to Sniper School?
[01:35:07] They said you will go to Sniper School right away.
[01:35:10] And that's cool.
[01:35:12] Yeah, I know, Sniper School, I won't say it was easy,
[01:35:16] because it's not, it's very difficult.
[01:35:18] But our workups at Team Four were basically,
[01:35:21] a lot of it was, especially the basic warfare part,
[01:35:25] was mini Sniper School.
[01:35:27] Really good marksman, really getting after it.
[01:35:29] The month of field craft, and then another month
[01:35:33] of land warfare, and then you get it all over again,
[01:35:36] going back into the jungle.
[01:35:38] That field craft that you needed, Sniper School,
[01:35:40] was all there.
[01:35:41] All the math was there for the shooting.
[01:35:44] It was all taught to us over and over and over and over again.
[01:35:47] So, yeah, I missed Honor Man by half a point.
[01:35:53] For Sniper School?
[01:35:54] Yes.
[01:35:55] That's a bummer.
[01:35:59] Yep.
[01:36:01] And, you know, it was, yeah, a little bit
[01:36:07] of love-hate relationship there,
[01:36:08] because I was always trying to get the guys
[01:36:11] on the reconnaissance side more reconnaissance work,
[01:36:14] and not as TV support stuff.
[01:36:18] So, then I became the LPO for all of it,
[01:36:23] the whole task unit, and I had to shift,
[01:36:26] and be nice to everybody.
[01:36:28] You know, when you fight for your squad,
[01:36:30] you fight for your potential.
[01:36:31] So, you were like a recce squad.
[01:36:33] Yes.
[01:36:34] You were the LPO of the recce squad at first,
[01:36:35] and then you became the LPO of everything.
[01:36:37] Yeah, a whole task unit.
[01:36:40] That was a good shift, too.
[01:36:41] Did you guys go on deployment somewhere?
[01:36:43] Yeah, we went to Spain, and from Spain,
[01:36:45] we went to Kosovo for whatever it was,
[01:36:49] couple of months, just doing reconnaissance.
[01:36:51] But this is post-September 11th.
[01:36:53] Post-September 11th.
[01:36:54] So, you're freaking chomping at the blame.
[01:36:57] Like, I went back to a team to go help out
[01:37:01] where help was needed, and that should've been
[01:37:05] where the war was.
[01:37:06] And it wasn't happening for the East Coast for a while.
[01:37:10] It was these Tuesdays.
[01:37:11] And then,
[01:37:14] then Buddy Miner was running the sniper school.
[01:37:18] Solid Stone, and he said,
[01:37:20] yeah, you come here and we will send you over
[01:37:22] as soon as an opportunity, you know?
[01:37:24] So, I went,
[01:37:27] you know, would be the scout course manager,
[01:37:29] and eventually the sniper course manager
[01:37:31] managed the compound.
[01:37:34] And, yeah, first opportunity, you know,
[01:37:36] deployed to Afghanistan, took my whole,
[01:37:39] you know, crazy sniper suite with me.
[01:37:42] And,
[01:37:43] 37 weapons.
[01:37:44] 37 weapons.
[01:37:45] Hey, it's, you know, yeah, you're Mark 11,
[01:37:48] you're Mark 12, you know, you're 10 inch upper,
[01:37:51] you're 16 inch upper, you're 300 win bag,
[01:37:53] you're 50 cal sniper rifle, you know,
[01:37:56] yeah, you're Mark 23, yeah, name something else.
[01:38:01] And who'd you attach to when you got over there?
[01:38:04] SEAL Team 2 and the CG SOTA, you know,
[01:38:06] and I would just try and get out on everything
[01:38:08] I would just try and get out on everything I'd get out on.
[01:38:11] You know, I ended up, I ended up doing a lot of briefing too,
[01:38:14] you know, it wasn't as, you know, cool as what I,
[01:38:17] you know, was expecting, but,
[01:38:18] you should have stayed in E5 is what you were thinking.
[01:38:20] Yeah.
[01:38:22] Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:24] It was, you know,
[01:38:27] but, you know, I learned a ton,
[01:38:29] and, you know, I was happy to get out there and support
[01:38:33] and be part of it.
[01:38:34] And it's a wildlife experience, you know,
[01:38:38] but yeah, I came back from that
[01:38:41] and finished up at Snipers, I'll tell you what,
[01:38:45] teaching folks and, you know, working with the cadre,
[01:38:49] that that's a wild, wild experience too,
[01:38:51] because our sniper school is legit.
[01:38:54] Our sniper school is awesome.
[01:38:55] Yeah.
[01:38:56] And our snipers are awesome.
[01:38:58] Oh yeah, no, you know, Brian Sargent came on board,
[01:39:01] you know, shortly after I got back and took over
[01:39:04] the sniper school, and that was awesome.
[01:39:09] We just took it to crazy levels.
[01:39:12] We were getting some 100% graduation rates,
[01:39:15] which had never been done before,
[01:39:16] usually lose 10% per major grade at the evolution.
[01:39:20] And we were just like,
[01:39:21] How'd you guys get it to 100%?
[01:39:23] We learned how to teach better.
[01:39:24] And we made sure the cadre was on the students, you know,
[01:39:29] but we learned how to talk, you know,
[01:39:33] don't think I'm being soft.
[01:39:36] I'm gonna tell you right now,
[01:39:37] Brian Sargent's one of my, you know,
[01:39:39] longest friends in the teams.
[01:39:41] And I know for a fact he was not being soft on himself.
[01:39:44] He's not soft on anything.
[01:39:46] He's not soft on himself and he's not soft on anybody else.
[01:39:48] So if he's saying somebody did it, they did it 100%.
[01:39:52] And yeah, learning how to talk to people right, you know,
[01:39:56] assigning the right instructor, the right students,
[01:39:58] we had the one-eyed sniper, you know.
[01:40:01] Adam Brown?
[01:40:02] Adam Brown got shot in his dominant eye.
[01:40:04] And what does this team guy decide to do
[01:40:07] when he gets shot in his dominant shooting eye?
[01:40:10] I'm gonna go to sniper school.
[01:40:11] Let's see if he's trying to get his eye healed, you know.
[01:40:15] And so we teach him how to shoot left-handed.
[01:40:19] Hydro became his, you know,
[01:40:21] who's a freak of a human fighting brain cancer right now.
[01:40:25] But a freak of a human and a crazy instructor
[01:40:29] and taught the dude to shoot iron sights left-handed
[01:40:34] and smoked it.
[01:40:37] But he cleaned the shooting test, you know,
[01:40:43] with the scope rifles, both of them, I believe.
[01:40:44] That's awesome.
[01:40:45] You know, you're talking out to a thousand yards,
[01:40:48] just pinging on steel.
[01:40:50] It's incredible.
[01:40:52] And you know, snaps and movers out to 800 yards
[01:40:56] with a 300 win mag at the time.
[01:40:58] It was incredible, you know.
[01:40:59] But, you know, Hydro found what he needed to say,
[01:41:03] how he needed to say it to him, you know.
[01:41:06] And Hydro's always someone that's on top of the students too.
[01:41:10] You know, he's not gonna leave them
[01:41:12] and go have a sidebar with a couple of instructors
[01:41:14] figure out what they're gonna do tonight.
[01:41:15] Yeah.
[01:41:16] You know, and the instructors, you know,
[01:41:19] a lot of them really wanted to, you know,
[01:41:22] it's not as hard as it was when I was in.
[01:41:24] And I go, yeah, dude, it's harder.
[01:41:26] You're just instructing better.
[01:41:28] And so we made up this test that wasn't graded,
[01:41:37] but we were, under the training command,
[01:41:43] you get three strikes.
[01:41:45] And we don't think that's right for sniper school
[01:41:47] because you can't have a third strike in a sniper shot.
[01:41:50] And so we had, you know, a guy that made it, you know,
[01:41:52] it was third time every time.
[01:41:55] We made up an exercise, basically briefed the students
[01:41:58] in the morning, hey, pull your rifles out.
[01:42:00] This is what you're doing.
[01:42:01] We're gonna put you in an urban hide.
[01:42:03] And the base was awesome.
[01:42:05] The base worked with us so incredible on everything.
[01:42:08] I had a 20 foot bullet trap made on a trailer,
[01:42:11] six and a half foot tall.
[01:42:14] I made two of them that you could back together,
[01:42:16] get a 40 foot runner.
[01:42:18] So I would drive around the base
[01:42:21] and made all the SDVs worked out, SDZs worked out,
[01:42:26] where they would shoot a blank.
[01:42:30] I would back the trailer up to where the blank was shot.
[01:42:33] And I would go stand next to the target
[01:42:35] and load a live round.
[01:42:39] And I would stand there with my binaus, three, two, one,
[01:42:43] execute.
[01:42:44] And so we had to have trust that student
[01:42:48] would not hit the window sill,
[01:42:49] not hit the fence of the tree that it was weak.
[01:42:51] This was short shots, 150 yards.
[01:42:54] I mean, sniper easy shots.
[01:42:55] But not when you're under pressure
[01:42:57] and not whatever you did the night before, the day before.
[01:43:02] But we wanted to be able to tell, you know,
[01:43:05] parent commands, hey, yeah, he did.
[01:43:07] He passed everything, but let's take a second look at it.
[01:43:11] He's not safe enough to do this evolution.
[01:43:14] And so I don't know where that went.
[01:43:15] We did it when I was there.
[01:43:16] I don't know where it went to after that.
[01:43:18] So where are you standing with your binaus
[01:43:20] as this shot's going?
[01:43:20] Right next to the target.
[01:43:21] Like two feet away from the target?
[01:43:24] Yeah.
[01:43:25] Yeah, that's a high level of trust right there.
[01:43:26] Yeah, I did it all day.
[01:43:29] They're my students.
[01:43:30] Yeah, and our snipers are freaking awesome, man.
[01:43:33] Yeah, and you're not, I mean,
[01:43:34] so these guys are already qualified on the weapons
[01:43:36] at this point.
[01:43:37] They've got some stocks to do.
[01:43:39] And they got like 50 cal week to do.
[01:43:41] They're really qualified on the weapon.
[01:43:43] This is where the question was,
[01:43:46] can that guy, when we wanted to do it,
[01:43:49] make the shot first time every time?
[01:43:51] Because that's what you want for our snipers.
[01:43:52] But they were my students.
[01:43:54] And so I had to have the confidence in them
[01:43:58] that they would do it, and I did.
[01:44:00] And it was, yeah, I don't know.
[01:44:05] So sniper school's morphed throughout the years
[01:44:07] is all kind of just about the same.
[01:44:09] Everybody tries to take it up to another notch
[01:44:11] and make it better.
[01:44:12] They're always fighting with the parent command
[01:44:14] that wants more snipers through.
[01:44:16] And, you know, but we'll always do it
[01:44:18] without lowering the standard.
[01:44:20] Yeah, I mean, obviously I had 13 snipers
[01:44:25] when I was a task unit commander.
[01:44:27] And like what a blessing from God
[01:44:29] to have 13 snipers in the battle or a modium.
[01:44:32] And you just can't ask for anything else.
[01:44:36] So, and the performance was epic.
[01:44:38] You know, the way the guys shot.
[01:44:40] I mean, I had guys take shots at enemy fighters
[01:44:46] holding children.
[01:44:50] And using children as human shields.
[01:44:54] And those kind of shots, shots through windows,
[01:44:57] through vehicle windows, and just hitting the driver
[01:45:00] and no one else in the vehicle.
[01:45:01] Like just awesome, unbelievable professionalism
[01:45:04] from the snipers.
[01:45:05] It was just outstanding.
[01:45:07] And you know, I always sit, when you start,
[01:45:08] when you look at the schools that we run,
[01:45:10] it's what you talked about earlier, you know,
[01:45:12] when you were running Marops, you're like,
[01:45:14] hey, how can I take this next level?
[01:45:15] How can we do a little bit better?
[01:45:16] How can I get more people more squared away?
[01:45:18] When you look at seal breaches,
[01:45:20] like the breaching schools, just awesome.
[01:45:23] The sniper schools, awesome.
[01:45:24] Just anything that you take a seal and you put them,
[01:45:29] you let us run a course, it's just gonna get good.
[01:45:32] We're just gonna get better.
[01:45:33] Just constantly trying to improve.
[01:45:35] And that's such a benefit for our community.
[01:45:37] It's one of the best things about our community.
[01:45:38] Oh yeah, the idea that the peer pressure,
[01:45:44] that you're not gonna let the standard drop,
[01:45:46] and that you are gonna provide something
[01:45:48] that they've never had before.
[01:45:50] And I mean, your reputation in the teams is all you have.
[01:45:54] I don't care what you did yesterday.
[01:45:56] You do something stupid a day,
[01:45:58] everybody's gonna remember you for that.
[01:46:00] You know, and if you slack off and you get,
[01:46:03] you make an easy training for jungle warfare,
[01:46:09] you're gonna get called on it.
[01:46:11] I mean, those trainings that we got, all of them,
[01:46:14] they've all been taken up another notch.
[01:46:16] And the biggest challenge as a leader
[01:46:20] is to make sure they don't get out of the lane too much.
[01:46:23] That instructor drift.
[01:46:24] Yeah, making stuff a little bit too crazy.
[01:46:27] Kinda happen from time to time.
[01:46:29] So you wrap up your time at Sniper School, what's next?
[01:46:37] Then I'm off to Maine.
[01:46:39] Ah, you finally get that goal.
[01:46:42] Well, I hadn't had short duty
[01:46:44] in what became 21 years a little bit.
[01:46:49] And so, and I'm kinda broken at this point too.
[01:46:51] You know, a ton of weight gain,
[01:46:54] couldn't figure that out.
[01:46:57] Like how much weight gain?
[01:46:58] I was up to 275-ish.
[01:47:01] Oh, dang.
[01:47:02] Does that ish mean 283 or something?
[01:47:05] Could be, you know?
[01:47:08] I just couldn't figure it out.
[01:47:09] My gut quit working, the anthrax vaccine, you know?
[01:47:13] That was a series of six shots.
[01:47:15] And all of a sudden, like I can have one beer.
[01:47:21] And I really didn't figure it out.
[01:47:22] We all went on the Atkin, the Fatkins diet, I call it.
[01:47:28] And when we went to Kosovo on that deployment.
[01:47:33] So I wasn't having any gluten, you know?
[01:47:37] And when we got back, we went to-
[01:47:40] And what effect did the Atkins diet have on you?
[01:47:44] Did you shred off a bunch of fat?
[01:47:46] We got crazy strong.
[01:47:48] And I didn't know what was going on at the time.
[01:47:52] So, and that was for several months.
[01:47:55] Did you lose fat though, on the Atkins diet?
[01:47:57] On the Atkins diet, probably.
[01:47:59] I just noticed we got really strong.
[01:48:01] I mean, no real notice to losing crazy amounts away.
[01:48:05] That's the purpose of that.
[01:48:06] I mean, that guy Atkins made that diet for people.
[01:48:08] And it did.
[01:48:09] I lost fat.
[01:48:11] We're eating meat and fat.
[01:48:13] Not to say that we followed it very strictly as far as,
[01:48:16] I mean, the whole percentages and all that.
[01:48:19] Like for the keto diet,
[01:48:21] I'm like a keto kook and I'm rigid.
[01:48:25] But definitely no bread, you know?
[01:48:27] No gluten, no beer, no nothing, no pasta.
[01:48:31] We go to Germany.
[01:48:33] So you feel good too?
[01:48:35] Feel good, okay.
[01:48:36] And then we go to Germany, you know, decompress, debrief.
[01:48:41] And how comes the Hefeweisen?
[01:48:44] Out for some pasta and beers and Bubeligen in Germany.
[01:48:48] And I didn't even make another restaurant.
[01:48:51] I just started going to Heven.
[01:48:53] And it basically shuts my gut down.
[01:48:57] And it was years.
[01:48:59] We didn't, you know, I wouldn't got my gut checked out.
[01:49:01] Yeah, yeah, a little ulcer in there, you know.
[01:49:04] Yeah, still stressed.
[01:49:05] I don't know, you know, couldn't figure it out.
[01:49:08] And I just kept throwing up all the damn time
[01:49:10] and gaining weight and I'm eating healthy, you know?
[01:49:14] I'm not drinking.
[01:49:15] I'm working out like a nut.
[01:49:17] And I'm just puffing up, the joints are getting,
[01:49:19] you know, the head's getting foggy.
[01:49:21] But at this point you're eating normal food.
[01:49:25] Normal, regular, healthy American diet, you know?
[01:49:29] Meat and potatoes, salad, you know, pasta, you know?
[01:49:34] And just couldn't, but it's all healthy.
[01:49:37] A ton of fruit.
[01:49:38] And what are you walking around at right now weight-wise?
[01:49:40] Right now, 205.
[01:49:41] So you want to, you are 70 pounds heavier than this.
[01:49:44] Oh yeah, plus, yeah.
[01:49:46] And this is when you get orders to go up to Maine?
[01:49:48] Yeah, yep, yep, I was gonna stay warm.
[01:49:51] Yeah, you were extra layers.
[01:49:54] Still, I mean, it's still strong,
[01:49:56] but the swelling started, you know,
[01:49:58] with the joints and everything like that.
[01:50:00] You know, I mean, I'm dumbbell pressing 145s.
[01:50:05] I mean, I was still freaky strong.
[01:50:08] And that's picking up off the ground, sitting back,
[01:50:11] and then sitting back up again
[01:50:12] and sitting back in the racks, legit, you know, press.
[01:50:16] That's funny, because I always drop those, whatever.
[01:50:19] If we're over 120, they're getting dropped, I don't know.
[01:50:22] They can't do it, respect to the dumbbells.
[01:50:24] Okay, cool.
[01:50:25] And no, it wasn't till, I don't know, maybe,
[01:50:32] so we're talking 99, we got the anthrax vaccines,
[01:50:36] and they cut mine off at the fifth shot,
[01:50:38] they never gave me the sixth.
[01:50:40] They just stopped doing it,
[01:50:41] because it was causing a lot of problems for a lot of people.
[01:50:43] Apparently it was a lawsuit too.
[01:50:45] A lot of aviators had to stop flying,
[01:50:49] but what it did to me.
[01:50:50] Yeah, I don't know, I got it, no factor,
[01:50:52] I never noticed it.
[01:50:53] Yeah, no, so people are different, you know?
[01:50:55] And yeah, it definitely,
[01:51:00] something there that caused something different for me.
[01:51:03] I think I got it when I went into boot camp though in 1990.
[01:51:06] Was it, is that possible?
[01:51:08] I don't think it was getting pushed then.
[01:51:09] Okay.
[01:51:10] It was the same one that they were giving the farmers.
[01:51:12] You know?
[01:51:13] Okay.
[01:51:14] Dairy farmers used to get,
[01:51:15] or still get the anthrax vaccine,
[01:51:16] but not, apparently not this one.
[01:51:19] Okay.
[01:51:20] And once I figured it out,
[01:51:23] Doc just said, hey, why don't you cut gluten out?
[01:51:26] And this is 2012 timeframe,
[01:51:29] so I'm walking around gaining weight,
[01:51:31] and getting sore, you know, crazy headaches,
[01:51:35] cut gluten out, bam, instantly lose 25 pounds.
[01:51:39] No kidding.
[01:51:40] And I kept on, you know, losing a little bit,
[01:51:42] and now I'm a keto kook.
[01:51:45] I mean, I'm strict.
[01:51:46] Like there's no, there's no pizza night.
[01:51:49] Nothing.
[01:51:50] I don't substitute.
[01:51:51] Not even just ordering an extra meat pizza,
[01:51:55] and just scraping the cheese, pepperoni,
[01:51:57] and sausage off into a bowl, and eating that,
[01:51:59] because I'm known to do that right there.
[01:52:01] Hey, that's all keto, and that's good to go.
[01:52:03] I know it's good to go.
[01:52:04] Yeah, I do the meat pizzas.
[01:52:06] Yeah.
[01:52:07] And, you know, with a side of guac or something,
[01:52:11] you know, butter in my coffee when I'm traveling,
[01:52:13] instead of MCT oil.
[01:52:15] Figure it out, your diet's huge.
[01:52:17] You've gotta figure out something.
[01:52:19] You know, I never stop working out,
[01:52:22] even though some things got, you know,
[01:52:23] caused me crazy headaches, I find something else to do.
[01:52:26] You know, find, you know, the blood flow restriction stuff,
[01:52:29] and some sort of suspension trainer.
[01:52:32] That will fire you up, you know, you use less meat.
[01:52:35] The blood flow restriction trainer,
[01:52:36] that's the, where's the katsu, right?
[01:52:38] Katsu, katsu.
[01:52:39] Katsutsu, K-A-T-S-U-U.
[01:52:41] Right?
[01:52:42] Correct.
[01:52:43] It's like a little system, you put it on,
[01:52:44] it's like a really strong,
[01:52:49] what is that called, blood pressure.
[01:52:51] Right, right, right, right.
[01:52:52] Cuff, that squeezes hard,
[01:52:54] and cuts the blood flow off to your lip.
[01:52:56] Right, the idea is you cut it by 80%,
[01:52:59] and then you work it.
[01:53:00] Right, and then you work out with 20% of the weight.
[01:53:04] So you're taking a load off your body,
[01:53:06] but you're still getting a hard,
[01:53:08] a mentally hard, and physically hard workout.
[01:53:11] So you're not causing all that stress and damage,
[01:53:14] and you're getting a legit workout.
[01:53:16] I mean, the thing I do is 30 minutes,
[01:53:18] I'll do some other stuff too, like with katsu bands,
[01:53:22] you know, you can do the rower for 20 minutes, legit.
[01:53:26] You're hurting.
[01:53:27] Yeah, you mentally have to fight to finish.
[01:53:31] Especially your arms,
[01:53:32] because you can, arms you gotta watch,
[01:53:34] you can cut the blood flow off,
[01:53:36] your brachial arteries are easier to get to
[01:53:38] than your femorrhoals.
[01:53:39] Femorrhoals you literally can't cut it off
[01:53:41] with a real tourniquet.
[01:53:44] But there's some training to go along with that, of course.
[01:53:46] I mean, just don't go ahead and start,
[01:53:50] cut the blood flow off.
[01:53:51] You all know what you're doing.
[01:53:52] And my workout partner's awesome, Pat.
[01:53:54] I mean, legit.
[01:53:56] I was his client first,
[01:53:58] as taking care of my neck, taking care of my hip,
[01:54:01] shoulder rehabs, hip and knee rehabs,
[01:54:05] and became a workout partner.
[01:54:08] And so I've got a pro that brought me into it,
[01:54:13] blood flow restriction stuff.
[01:54:14] And there's crazy Doppler systems that,
[01:54:17] a lot of it was pre-amputee.
[01:54:19] This one system, can't remember the name of it right now,
[01:54:21] but it's four grand, you know.
[01:54:24] But it actually has a Doppler,
[01:54:25] tells you what your blood flow is.
[01:54:26] Oh, God.
[01:54:27] You know, he was thinking of bringing
[01:54:28] something on board for clients.
[01:54:30] But you have to,
[01:54:33] you really have to know that it's okay,
[01:54:37] because the pain you're gonna feel in your arms, legit.
[01:54:41] And you question it,
[01:54:43] but if you have this Doppler, it says, oh, it's okay.
[01:54:46] You know, if you do your capillary refill,
[01:54:48] you get three seconds on it, you know, then you're okay.
[01:54:51] You know, it just gotta know you're not,
[01:54:53] it hurts, but you're not harming yourself.
[01:54:56] Yeah.
[01:54:56] Any workouts that cause questioning
[01:54:59] are good, you know.
[01:55:01] Like that 20 rep squat workout,
[01:55:04] that causes questioning of life.
[01:55:06] And like whether you wanna be, you know,
[01:55:08] I've been doing that workout where I'm literally questioning
[01:55:11] if I even wanna be strong.
[01:55:12] If I even wanna be a man, I'm just like,
[01:55:14] well maybe I could just hang up on everything,
[01:55:17] just call it good, I'm just gonna become a whatever.
[01:55:20] So, you know, take on a different course,
[01:55:23] a different path in my life.
[01:55:24] Oh yeah.
[01:55:25] So workouts like that are good.
[01:55:27] Yeah, no, no.
[01:55:28] I mean, you've gotta do something.
[01:55:29] That's like the greatest thing about,
[01:55:31] you have to have some little piece of adversity, you know.
[01:55:34] I don't care.
[01:55:35] In Maine, you gotta go get the mail,
[01:55:37] and you gotta, you know, and it's really cold outside.
[01:55:40] And you know, we got chickens, or we had chickens.
[01:55:43] I'd like to get them again,
[01:55:44] because kids gotta get the eggs.
[01:55:47] You can come into the house when you get off the bus,
[01:55:49] or you can go get the eggs and come in the house.
[01:55:52] But if you come in the house,
[01:55:53] you're still going to get the eggs,
[01:55:55] and you gotta put your boots back on.
[01:55:56] And in the morning, before you get on the bus,
[01:55:59] you gotta go change out, make sure the water's,
[01:56:01] you know, not frozen, and replace it.
[01:56:05] Good little responsibility for them.
[01:56:07] Yeah, yeah, but it's a piece of adversity
[01:56:09] that's easy, easy to overcome.
[01:56:11] You gotta have something in your life
[01:56:13] that makes and makes decisions.
[01:56:18] Yeah.
[01:56:19] So going back, you get this billet up to Maine,
[01:56:23] which for people who don't know,
[01:56:24] probably wouldn't, why would you know this?
[01:56:25] There's a Sears School survival,
[01:56:27] evasion, resistance, and escape school up in Maine.
[01:56:30] And it's where the whole Navy, is it just Navy?
[01:56:33] Is there any Marine Corps?
[01:56:34] And then you get a couple, you know,
[01:56:36] foreign nationals in there once in a while.
[01:56:38] But they come like, for instance, aircrew.
[01:56:40] If you're a pilot or you're aircrew,
[01:56:42] you gotta go up to this school
[01:56:43] and learn how to survive, how to evade,
[01:56:46] how to resist interrogation, and how to escape.
[01:56:51] I know I went, when I went to SEAL Team One,
[01:56:53] when I was a new guy,
[01:56:54] the first thing they did was send you to Sears School.
[01:56:56] Great.
[01:56:57] I went to the one that's out here on the West Coast.
[01:57:00] And very, very good training, very thorough training,
[01:57:04] very cool training.
[01:57:06] But you ended up being an instructor
[01:57:08] up there at that school.
[01:57:10] And you show up there what's cool about this school,
[01:57:13] kind of like being a Bud's instructor,
[01:57:15] which I was never a Bud's instructor,
[01:57:16] but you get a glimpse into human psychology.
[01:57:19] Oh, man.
[01:57:19] That, you know, I was talking to Andy Stumpf the other day.
[01:57:24] He was like debriefing me on, you know,
[01:57:26] he was a second phase dive instructor at Bud's.
[01:57:29] And he could just know when he's doing pool comp
[01:57:32] on something, he had all these different,
[01:57:34] you know, he could just watch the way a person's
[01:57:36] moving their body and know exactly what they're gonna do.
[01:57:38] Oh, he's getting ready to bowl.
[01:57:39] Oh, he's gonna pass out.
[01:57:41] Oh, this guy's panicking.
[01:57:42] You just see it over and over again.
[01:57:45] And so same thing at Sears School,
[01:57:47] you're gonna watch people from a detached perspective
[01:57:50] because you're an instructor,
[01:57:51] you're not all freaked out or engaged in it.
[01:57:53] And you get to see how they respond
[01:57:55] and you get to learn how, well,
[01:57:57] the interrogation piece is huge as far as human interaction.
[01:58:00] Oh, wow.
[01:58:01] Everything.
[01:58:03] So we conduct training to 50 below zero.
[01:58:06] And just the idea of that for some point.
[01:58:09] And we modify it.
[01:58:10] You know, I mean, you don't just do the same thing.
[01:58:13] The instructor's huge responsibility.
[01:58:16] And you've got folks that have been cubicle warriors,
[01:58:19] they're pilots, they signed on to be a pilot
[01:58:22] or an air crew with a, you know,
[01:58:24] a coachy seat and an airplane.
[01:58:25] Oh, they definitely liked that.
[01:58:26] And, you know, you get some,
[01:58:29] you got some Marine recon to go through, you know,
[01:58:31] used to get seals go through, still do.
[01:58:33] Like we've talked about, they got their own course now.
[01:58:38] And they're doing some things that are legit.
[01:58:43] You know, you're making a snow cave
[01:58:45] and that's where you're staying tonight.
[01:58:47] And you watch people.
[01:58:49] And this one, he was, you know,
[01:58:52] going through to be a C2 pilot.
[01:58:55] And he did not want to stay outside that night.
[01:58:58] And he was trying to sleep
[01:59:00] because you have these Adirondack shelters,
[01:59:02] which is actually going to be colder
[01:59:04] and you're cramped in with all these other people.
[01:59:06] But there's, it's off the ground
[01:59:09] and there's only insulation under the floor.
[01:59:11] So you're just, you're going to freeze.
[01:59:12] You make a snow cave and you're going to be happy as happy.
[01:59:15] You're going to be, your body's going to warm it up.
[01:59:17] You just have to have the confidence to do that.
[01:59:19] And watching somebody try and slow roll it.
[01:59:22] And I go, hey, tonight you're sleeping here.
[01:59:26] Whether you get this done in the daytime
[01:59:28] or you get it done at night, you'll be happier.
[01:59:32] I'm doing you a favor.
[01:59:34] And you, but watching their minds work,
[01:59:37] watching people try and attach themselves to people
[01:59:39] so they can get through, you know,
[01:59:42] like, cause there were still team guys going through.
[01:59:46] And, you know, people want to attach themselves
[01:59:49] to that team guy cause they're going to drag them through.
[01:59:51] But if you can't do what that team guy's going to do,
[01:59:55] especially when you go on two brand of Asian,
[01:59:58] you know, it's, yeah, it's wild to see.
[02:00:01] And when they are in the captivity portion,
[02:00:05] you know, watching what happens,
[02:00:09] you know, either diamond people out,
[02:00:10] then you don't need, people really get into the problem.
[02:00:13] And they really, I mean, there's a little made up language,
[02:00:17] you know, it's got like 150 words.
[02:00:19] And they don't come out of character at all.
[02:00:23] The first time you see some of these people
[02:00:26] cause they hide them and they come into the back of the building
[02:00:28] that students never see them in the classroom portion.
[02:00:31] And the first time they see them, they're in character.
[02:00:33] And yeah, it's, it's-
[02:00:35] Are you guys doing the Eastern block thing still?
[02:00:37] Yeah, man.
[02:00:38] They couldn't get away from it.
[02:00:40] You know, it's a vehicle.
[02:00:42] But I was like, you know,
[02:00:44] that's what the war is going on right now.
[02:00:46] I was telling you, I mean,
[02:00:48] when I went to Sierra school and you get,
[02:00:50] you have to turn, if you don't get captured by certain time,
[02:00:51] you gotta turn yourself in.
[02:00:52] They put me in a truck, they pull us out.
[02:00:54] They put me against the wall.
[02:00:56] And this guy's like, they asked me a question.
[02:00:59] And you know me, I'm freaking 19 years old, you know,
[02:01:02] just got out of buds and I'm just like,
[02:01:04] what's this dude's gonna do to me?
[02:01:06] And I gave him some wise ass answer.
[02:01:08] Bwack!
[02:01:09] He slapped me as hard as he could.
[02:01:13] I mean, look, I've been punched.
[02:01:14] I've been slapped many times,
[02:01:15] where I've been punched in the face.
[02:01:17] This was as hard, you know, this was an open-handed slap.
[02:01:20] And he did it like three or four more times.
[02:01:22] And I was like, okay,
[02:01:23] I guess I'm gonna have to freaking chill out a little bit
[02:01:26] because my bro right here is ready to get it on.
[02:01:30] Yeah, basically, if you're getting some extra treatment,
[02:01:34] then you're not doing it right.
[02:01:36] Something, you know, because it's not about being tough.
[02:01:38] You're a punk as well.
[02:01:39] Well, from my case, what I was not doing right
[02:01:41] was I was not being humble and respectful
[02:01:44] and treating the thing as if it was real.
[02:01:47] I was just like, whatever.
[02:01:49] Okay, okay, 100%.
[02:01:53] I'm in.
[02:01:53] There's, you know, the tough marine mentality, you know,
[02:01:56] which is good to have, but you gotta know when to say,
[02:01:58] hey, that's not gonna work in this situation.
[02:02:02] And using those tools and techniques, you know,
[02:02:04] to be polite, you know.
[02:02:08] Give me a rundown of interrogation techniques
[02:02:10] that you like.
[02:02:12] I like the nice guy interrogator.
[02:02:13] I said I wouldn't go do the hard side, you know.
[02:02:17] Basically, I taught the camping part first, you know,
[02:02:20] and then I went and did that deployment we talked about,
[02:02:23] you know, I've never been away from,
[02:02:24] we get in that later, but I like the simple soft sell approach,
[02:02:31] just talking to folks.
[02:02:33] And it's really the way you order questions, you know,
[02:02:36] that read technique where you really give somebody
[02:02:38] a reason why they did something they did wrong.
[02:02:42] Kind of give them a way out,
[02:02:44] but leading them to admit to something they did wrong.
[02:02:47] It's, that soft sell is magic.
[02:02:52] It's really just a conversation.
[02:02:53] Cause I'd be like the first person that they've seen
[02:02:56] that's nice to them after they've, you know.
[02:02:59] Been slapped around and all of a sudden you're doing cool.
[02:03:02] Like, hey, I understand.
[02:03:03] I understand why, you know, you've been isolated
[02:03:08] and kept away from everybody.
[02:03:09] You heard probably the coughing, you know,
[02:03:11] so we have to keep you away from everybody
[02:03:12] and we had to take away all your stuff
[02:03:14] and make sure you're all clean and good.
[02:03:17] And, you know, and there's purposely a camera
[02:03:20] with a red light on it that they can see.
[02:03:22] And they're admitting to different things.
[02:03:24] And it's really, it's wild to see.
[02:03:29] It's way beyond what a lot of the instructors think it is.
[02:03:33] It's how to get through roadblocks,
[02:03:36] how to get yourself out of a ticket.
[02:03:38] It's how to, you know, it's everyday instances.
[02:03:43] It's a job interview.
[02:03:45] It's really sitting across the table right now
[02:03:48] and thinking slowly, you know, sometimes if I ask a question
[02:03:51] I might swallow or take a drink of water
[02:03:52] so I can think for a half a second
[02:03:54] and come up with that, you know, better,
[02:03:56] polite or answer.
[02:03:57] It's keeping that military bearing
[02:03:59] and not, you know, being starting a fight, you know,
[02:04:05] that helps you out a crazy amount.
[02:04:08] Yeah, we've had some POWs on here,
[02:04:11] mainly from, actually I think all the POWs
[02:04:14] have from the Vietnam War.
[02:04:16] And it's incredible to hear their stories
[02:04:18] and what they went through.
[02:04:20] And they came back and put injected their lessons learned
[02:04:24] into the Sierra Schools.
[02:04:26] And so that was awesome to get those lessons learned
[02:04:29] and just different breaking points, you know,
[02:04:32] how long someone can take it
[02:04:33] and, you know, everyone's gonna eventually break,
[02:04:37] but, you know, how much, you know, how long are you gonna go?
[02:04:40] And even when they break, they give bad information
[02:04:42] or useless information and pretty heroic stuff there.
[02:04:46] Did you say you went on a deployment
[02:04:47] while you were at Sierra School?
[02:04:49] Yeah, so originally I was gonna go out the door
[02:04:52] with Seal Team two and do my re-enlistment there with them
[02:04:57] and get it all happy and tax-free.
[02:05:00] And that got denied because I needed there at the school.
[02:05:06] You know, there's only a couple of seals there.
[02:05:08] And really, you know, there's some Marines there too,
[02:05:10] but then the rest are all air crew and pilots.
[02:05:13] That's not what they do for a living.
[02:05:15] So, and then later on, you know,
[02:05:18] it kind of made a little better, better stink about it,
[02:05:20] a little better sales pitch to go.
[02:05:22] And I was gonna go on deployment with Seal Team eight
[02:05:25] to Iraq and it was all worked out.
[02:05:28] I was even gonna stay there longer.
[02:05:30] I was gonna really do some things,
[02:05:33] Seal related there, you know, maybe not,
[02:05:36] but I was gonna be in task unit and I was bringing up
[02:05:38] my snack.
[02:05:39] Well, I mean, we were capturing a lot of guys
[02:05:41] throughout the war and having, you know,
[02:05:43] at a point we kind of transferred to having our own,
[02:05:47] well, not our own seals, but other seals,
[02:05:49] due interrogations and due intel gathering.
[02:05:51] They were freaking great, man.
[02:05:53] They were awesome.
[02:05:54] So it was really good to have guys
[02:05:56] that were able to do that kind of stuff.
[02:05:58] Yeah, and it's, and I probably wouldn't have been doing that,
[02:06:02] but actually working in, you know,
[02:06:05] the pitch from our side of recovery,
[02:06:08] but really I was just gonna be working with a task unit
[02:06:11] and I was gonna be an extra gun and work whatever,
[02:06:14] you know, worked it out with the Command-Mash Chief.
[02:06:18] Have gun, we'll travel.
[02:06:20] Yep, and all worked out, ready to go.
[02:06:23] So I get, I'm on my way down to Virginia Beach
[02:06:27] and the civilian ops guy says,
[02:06:30] hey, we have this requirement in Columbia, you know,
[02:06:33] the agency guys got wrapped up down there
[02:06:36] and they're trying to get them out
[02:06:39] and we need a Spanish speaker.
[02:06:41] Okay, so I was on my way down there
[02:06:45] and they got released, but I was already on my way down,
[02:06:55] so I went to go work with the front Teresa
[02:06:58] and was attached to Debt South
[02:07:00] and stayed down there for four months
[02:07:03] and that was pretty wild
[02:07:05] because I hadn't been to Panama since it closed
[02:07:10] and went into the Darien, you know,
[02:07:14] just checking some things out
[02:07:16] and you see an entire boat load of gateway computers
[02:07:22] going, making its way into the Darien.
[02:07:25] You can't miss those boxes, you know,
[02:07:26] the white and black boxes.
[02:07:30] And then you see a whole, you know,
[02:07:32] Cayuca, you know, dug out Canoe Load,
[02:07:34] come of empty El Panama, you know, beer coming back out.
[02:07:41] A lot goes on in the Darien Gap, you know,
[02:07:43] where it's really a national forest,
[02:07:44] you can't go in there.
[02:07:46] There's no vehicle traffic in there
[02:07:48] unless you, you know, narco-terrorist.
[02:07:51] And so, yeah, there's definitely a ton that goes down there,
[02:07:53] a whole bunch of, I'll leave it at different things
[02:07:56] to get funneled through
[02:07:57] and it was really neat to see and be part of that
[02:08:01] and try and get the front Teresa online
[02:08:03] to, you know, help us out
[02:08:05] and keep things from coming north.
[02:08:08] And that ends up being your last deployment in the teams?
[02:08:11] Yeah, and then back up to, you know,
[02:08:15] back up to finish my time out at Sears School.
[02:08:18] Tunne Learn though, watching the different interaction
[02:08:21] with, you know, the Chinese that were down there,
[02:08:25] you know, getting their fingers into everything, you know.
[02:08:29] Yeah, you know, yeah, I'll leave it at that.
[02:08:32] There's definitely some work that needs to be done there.
[02:08:38] You see, then it next up is retirement.
[02:08:40] And what are you planning to do when you retire?
[02:08:42] So this is now 2009 you're gonna retire?
[02:08:44] Or you retire?
[02:08:44] Yeah, new year's year 2009.
[02:08:49] Start the new year unemployed was a plan.
[02:08:52] Gotta go Whittlewood in Maine.
[02:08:54] And I had, you know, nest egg settled up.
[02:08:57] I didn't need to work for a few years
[02:08:58] if I didn't need one too, you know.
[02:09:00] And that never happened.
[02:09:03] You know, the call started coming
[02:09:05] and I started doing some training back with the teams.
[02:09:08] Just contracting?
[02:09:10] Yeah, we're gonna sit X's, work some different training pieces,
[02:09:14] ended up doing some research, test development stuff.
[02:09:18] And then, then I'm going to Yemen,
[02:09:23] not with the teams, the contractor there,
[02:09:26] and, you know, administrative, the security guy.
[02:09:30] And that was pretty wild, cause that's the, you know,
[02:09:34] AQAP, you know, al-Qaeda and the Arabian Peninsula,
[02:09:37] the hot, hot spot, we were right in the hot spot
[02:09:40] of the hot spot.
[02:09:41] So really learning how to use my words
[02:09:44] cause we didn't have a gun.
[02:09:46] And you've got, you got to run around blowing up our wells.
[02:09:50] And it's, the stories are pretty weird
[02:09:55] because they're that dumb.
[02:09:57] Everybody's gotta understand they're all stoned.
[02:10:00] Everybody in Yemen choose cotton, you know,
[02:10:03] which is a hallucinogenic and phenamine.
[02:10:07] And they're all, you know, in the city,
[02:10:09] they start chewing it, you know, about four o'clock
[02:10:12] in the desert, they chew it earlier.
[02:10:14] In the desert, it's got a whole bunch of
[02:10:19] different fertilizers in it.
[02:10:20] And it's, it's, it winds them up a little bit more.
[02:10:24] And so you try, you know, we don't want to get a,
[02:10:28] doing everything at the same time, all the time.
[02:10:30] You leave in the gate, you know,
[02:10:32] but you try and get things done in the morning
[02:10:34] cause they're wound up in the afternoon.
[02:10:36] And so that's different.
[02:10:37] And we've got three different facilities we're checking out,
[02:10:40] trying to keep the oil flow into the job.
[02:10:43] Your inner security is the tribe
[02:10:47] and the outer security and all the outposts
[02:10:50] are the Yemeni army and they hate each other.
[02:10:54] The Yemeni army has a drinking problem.
[02:10:57] They make their own hooch along with a cot.
[02:11:00] And the State Department contract for pilots,
[02:11:05] pilot training, you will not chew cotton while flying.
[02:11:10] So that kind of sets the quesa of it.
[02:11:12] That actually has to be written in a contract of,
[02:11:16] and literally we had millions of dollars
[02:11:20] of oil production slowed or stopped
[02:11:22] because they didn't get their tea and crackers.
[02:11:26] And literally, cause the driver guards
[02:11:28] want their tea and crackers.
[02:11:30] Well, their cousin hijacked the truck
[02:11:34] that has the tea and crackers in it
[02:11:35] and took it back to the town, Bahan.
[02:11:38] And we'll tell your cousin to let it go.
[02:11:42] And eventually just let him and Ha on it for a while
[02:11:48] cause the sharing agreement gets pushed to the right
[02:11:52] and they're not really losing money, it's just delaying it.
[02:11:56] And so you eventually resolve it.
[02:11:57] Hey, we'll go ahead and give you money
[02:11:59] to buy your own tea and crackers
[02:12:01] and we'll get, you know, things going again.
[02:12:04] Eventually they say okay.
[02:12:05] And then eventually they come around to say yep,
[02:12:08] we're happy getting the raise
[02:12:09] and now we want our tea and crackers again.
[02:12:11] It's, but you get run down in the desert by a guy
[02:12:15] who just got, his brother got drawn to the desert
[02:12:18] cause he's running around with Al Qaeda.
[02:12:20] And his brother wants payback or his dad
[02:12:24] through his brother wants payback for his son.
[02:12:28] He wants his back pay cause he used to work for the army
[02:12:34] but he now he worked for Al Qaeda when he got,
[02:12:36] you know, got the drone strike.
[02:12:39] And he wants back pay and medical benefits from the company
[02:12:43] cause he used to work for the company also
[02:12:46] but he was blowing up the pipeline and the wells, you know,
[02:12:51] one day he got it below the restrictor, the cutoff.
[02:12:55] And so it wouldn't stop.
[02:12:57] You know, normally it'll just cut itself off the fire.
[02:13:01] So you got to bring wild oil in it like four
[02:13:03] or five million a day.
[02:13:05] Day.
[02:13:06] Yeah.
[02:13:07] There's a bill.
[02:13:09] And this guy runs you down in the desert.
[02:13:12] I know there were a couple of shots over your head
[02:13:15] to just kind of chest bump, you know,
[02:13:19] not really intended to shoot at you
[02:13:21] but shoot at you pretty close.
[02:13:23] And they outnumber us and they've got better firepower.
[02:13:27] So you stop and you talk it out, you know.
[02:13:31] And, you know, hey, we'll work on this.
[02:13:33] And, you know, I make the fake glass in the air
[02:13:36] and they look like I'm looking for the drone.
[02:13:38] And my security guy is like their cousin, you know,
[02:13:44] but he's sworn to take care of me and it's legit.
[02:13:48] And there's two guys with belt fed, you know,
[02:13:50] RPKs and yeah, it's you learn to use your words.
[02:13:58] It's serious school help with that.
[02:13:59] And I'm doing it through an interpreter too.
[02:14:02] You know, Helo pilot has a stroke that works
[02:14:07] for the oil company because they're spiraling up
[02:14:11] to 11,000 feet to get out of the range of the fire.
[02:14:15] Cause I'm there during the Arab spring.
[02:14:17] And the guy has a stroke that later that day
[02:14:23] in the chow hall and they come find in me, you know,
[02:14:25] hey, Mr. Ed, you know, he just had a stroke.
[02:14:29] All right, let's load them up and, you know,
[02:14:32] get one of our vehicles.
[02:14:33] He didn't work for us.
[02:14:34] He works for a separate company that's not taken care of him.
[02:14:37] Like, I mean, those people are taking care of me
[02:14:40] and we're taking care of everybody.
[02:14:41] And so load them up, take them to the hospital.
[02:14:46] I didn't go, you know, just provided what he needed.
[02:14:50] And then next day, Mr. Ed,
[02:14:53] they're not letting us into the hospital.
[02:14:55] You know, it's free, this free medical care,
[02:14:57] but you got to bring your sheets and your food every day
[02:15:00] and go out in town and get the medicine
[02:15:02] that they're prescribing for you and bring it back.
[02:15:05] Well, that day, President Sala got blown up, you know,
[02:15:10] and one of the shakes that got blown up in that mosque
[02:15:14] was in that same hospital.
[02:15:16] So that tribe took over the hospital
[02:15:18] and they've got it sandbagged in.
[02:15:21] They've got, you know, literally,
[02:15:24] RPGs walking through the hallways, you know,
[02:15:28] good times, good times.
[02:15:30] And, you know, I'm this 200 and,
[02:15:34] probably 65 pound white guy, you know,
[02:15:37] blonde hair guy at this time, you know,
[02:15:39] and then, yeah, get me this interpreter.
[02:15:44] And we're going to the hospital.
[02:15:47] I said, hey, here's what you're gonna say.
[02:15:49] You're gonna say how I say it.
[02:15:51] You got to tell them that you're very happy
[02:15:54] that they're there.
[02:15:55] You're very sorry about their shake, you know,
[02:15:59] getting blown up and we've got a guy in there too.
[02:16:03] You guys are taking care of your guy.
[02:16:05] We want to take care of our guy.
[02:16:06] Please continue to make the hospital secure,
[02:16:09] but we'd like to go in there
[02:16:10] so we could take care of our guy also.
[02:16:12] Could you please let us in?
[02:16:14] And it worked.
[02:16:15] They were getting shut down, you know,
[02:16:16] and would not be allowed in.
[02:16:18] So we go in there and it's a trade.
[02:16:20] They've got all these old overpressure blast folks
[02:16:22] that are just smoked.
[02:16:23] And then this guy's in there with, you know,
[02:16:26] I had a stroke, you know, grown man diaper
[02:16:28] and not getting taken care of.
[02:16:30] And so we get them all set.
[02:16:32] They run out in town to go get the medicine
[02:16:34] and I stayed there with him and they come back
[02:16:38] and they call me up and said,
[02:16:39] they're not letting us in again.
[02:16:41] What would you do?
[02:16:42] Well, we just want in.
[02:16:44] Start all over again.
[02:16:46] You're happy to there.
[02:16:47] They're making the hospital secure.
[02:16:49] Not really happy, but you're telling them they're happy.
[02:16:52] You got your guy, we got our guy.
[02:16:53] We want to take care of our guy
[02:16:55] like you're taking care of your guy.
[02:16:56] And up, you know, then they come back in
[02:16:59] and it's, yeah, the ability to find something.
[02:17:04] The common piece, your guys hurt and our guys hurt.
[02:17:06] We're happier here.
[02:17:08] You know, you're going through a checkpoint, you know.
[02:17:11] Man, I'm happy you guys here.
[02:17:12] Have you guys seen anything?
[02:17:13] Is everything good?
[02:17:15] You know, is anything we need to be aware of?
[02:17:17] You know, because, you know,
[02:17:20] you're not happy to there, but you got to explain that.
[02:17:23] You know, get that, find something that's in common
[02:17:27] that may or may not be.
[02:17:28] Yeah, build a little quick relationship.
[02:17:30] Yeah, a little rapport.
[02:17:31] Yeah.
[02:17:32] So, ton of that.
[02:17:34] Yeah.
[02:17:35] So how long did you do that contracting stuff for?
[02:17:39] It's just kind of continual since I retired.
[02:17:42] You know, it really started working
[02:17:44] to get for Brian, Sergeant, you know.
[02:17:46] And he'd get me set up on all kinds of, you know,
[02:17:49] name of companies, but it was fantastic.
[02:17:51] You know, everything from going to the Olympics
[02:17:53] to the World Cup, living out town with the athletes.
[02:17:56] And, you know, as team guys, you're just not a monkey.
[02:17:59] You're setting everything up,
[02:18:02] squaring everything away,
[02:18:03] way beyond what security guy does.
[02:18:06] And making sure everything flows smoothly,
[02:18:08] picking up, you know, gaps without dropping security.
[02:18:11] And security is a civilian, especially executive stuff,
[02:18:16] is you really have to have a really,
[02:18:21] you know, easy but hard mentality at the same time.
[02:18:24] I'm trying to look like somebody
[02:18:25] that you don't want to bother,
[02:18:27] and you're going to go, you know,
[02:18:28] bother the other watch company, you know,
[02:18:32] because that one's not worth hitting.
[02:18:34] And at the same time, you know,
[02:18:36] they might want you sitting at the table with them
[02:18:37] when you'd rather not, because that's not your job.
[02:18:40] But it is to them.
[02:18:42] So you gotta make a bunch of assessments.
[02:18:44] And, you know, yeah, do some stuff you wouldn't normally do,
[02:18:49] but you do the assessment.
[02:18:50] And, you know, it's really interesting, super, super flexible.
[02:18:55] And you have to be super personable,
[02:18:59] be able to talk with, you know, heads of state
[02:19:03] that these, you know, top, I mean,
[02:19:07] I've been to F1 races in the absolute most,
[02:19:13] without naming the company, as good as it gets.
[02:19:15] And you're talking to some wild people.
[02:19:17] And, you know, they want to talk to you,
[02:19:20] because you're the seal, you know,
[02:19:22] and they're proud to have you with them,
[02:19:24] and they're showing you off.
[02:19:26] I got a job to do still.
[02:19:28] But it's a wild mix.
[02:19:32] And if you are the grumpy guy,
[02:19:35] because I was with, you know, a rock band,
[02:19:38] and who's really good people, super, you know,
[02:19:44] yeah, just, that was super enjoyable.
[02:19:46] But we got some, we're always augmented overseas
[02:19:49] by somebody else.
[02:19:51] And the folks that are augmenting us,
[02:19:57] they just have this militant look about them,
[02:20:01] you know, including having sleeves rolled up,
[02:20:03] and like, you know, even, you know,
[02:20:07] cargo panties, you know, pants and stuff.
[02:20:10] And that's not the look we want, folks.
[02:20:12] And a lot of ways to do overseas, you know,
[02:20:14] I'm making sure the law enforcement that's there
[02:20:17] is that they, and I don't know them very well,
[02:20:24] so it's, you know, because we're jumping
[02:20:26] into a lot of things, but I'm making sure
[02:20:28] they feel right, you know, that they're not
[02:20:31] nervous themselves.
[02:20:33] You know, if you're there a long time,
[02:20:35] I'm making sure the driver is the same feel today
[02:20:38] as he had yesterday and the day before, you know,
[02:20:41] so that, you know, he wasn't threatened
[02:20:44] and told to make a left-hand turn, you know,
[02:20:46] when he's supposed to be going straight.
[02:20:48] It's a ton of that.
[02:20:49] I've talked to the clients a lot, you know,
[02:20:52] they need to build rapport and be kind
[02:20:56] to their security personnel and their drivers and things
[02:20:59] so that, you know, they love them, you know,
[02:21:03] their family, because you're asking them to take,
[02:21:06] you know, when I'm, it's, the deal is,
[02:21:08] I'm gonna stick my neck out for these people
[02:21:10] and this father's gonna risk his life for these folks,
[02:21:13] and so are those folks.
[02:21:15] So you better treat them kind and like family, you know,
[02:21:19] and I know a lot of these folks, they use us as a,
[02:21:22] you know, a bit of a prop, you know,
[02:21:25] hey, let's get going, you know, or interject here and there,
[02:21:28] and it's, it's, there's some, you know,
[02:21:32] some of these guys are skilled sales folks
[02:21:33] and they're doing some act and, you know, you take it on it.
[02:21:36] Yeah, but he knows that I know also, you know,
[02:21:40] so okay, it's, again, it's a wild ride
[02:21:43] if you're not flexible and you don't have a mentality
[02:21:46] that can roll with it a little bit,
[02:21:48] yeah, you're not gonna be very successful at it.
[02:21:50] And I've had some wild clients, I really enjoyed that part.
[02:21:53] I like taking care of folks and I'm, yeah, admittedly,
[02:21:57] I'm saying I'm pretty damn good at it
[02:21:59] because they keep calling me back, you know,
[02:22:02] and you know, and Brian's keeps feeding stuff
[02:22:04] and I haven't done it in a while.
[02:22:06] I started doing a lot of already, you know,
[02:22:08] RDT and research, testing development with teams
[02:22:11] and some other fun things.
[02:22:12] So yeah, you know, became a firefighter, you know,
[02:22:16] a volunteer firefighter and all,
[02:22:17] or was rather an Alma until we moved from there.
[02:22:20] Then I became a reserve deputy sheriff in Lincoln County.
[02:22:25] And so you're doing some contracting,
[02:22:28] you're doing some firefighting,
[02:22:30] you're doing some reserve sheriff activity.
[02:22:32] At what point do you get roped in
[02:22:36] to the political arena?
[02:22:39] Yeah, and I'm doing all that.
[02:22:41] I bought an excavator, you know,
[02:22:43] I'm grading driveways and digging foundations for folks,
[02:22:47] I'm doing some diving for folks.
[02:22:49] I mean, I've got all these things going on,
[02:22:51] I'm getting my, I got my private pilot license,
[02:22:54] I'm about to start getting my commercial license.
[02:22:57] And yeah, it's, you know, 14-ish months ago,
[02:23:01] people have been asking a lot for us to get involved,
[02:23:04] for me to get involved in the politics
[02:23:06] and because things are going sideways.
[02:23:09] And I kept saying nope, nope, nope.
[02:23:11] And things got to the head and they asked again,
[02:23:15] again I said no and tell a story over and over,
[02:23:18] and my wife said yes you will.
[02:23:21] And her, she's from, and she was yes, yes, yes you will.
[02:23:24] We talked about it, her being from Venezuela
[02:23:26] and seeing that, you know, that leadership gap
[02:23:31] in Venezuela, you know, caused it to spiral down.
[02:23:33] People don't realize it was Venezuela.
[02:23:36] We used to get 17% of our oil from Venezuela.
[02:23:38] Oh yeah, more than any other country.
[02:23:39] I mean, they were, they were a wealthy country.
[02:23:44] And now they are, you know, again,
[02:23:47] just like the hospital in Yemen,
[02:23:51] you had to go out in town and get medicine
[02:23:53] and provide your sheets and provide your food in hospital.
[02:23:56] There's no medicine out in town now either.
[02:23:59] You had to go to Columbia.
[02:24:00] Her family's a big part of it's originally from Columbia.
[02:24:03] Well, they escaped the Narco State and went to Venezuela
[02:24:06] and now they're fleeing back to the Narco State.
[02:24:08] They had to go to Columbia to get medicine
[02:24:10] for her uncle who was in the hospital.
[02:24:12] And yeah, hey, we've got kids, you know,
[02:24:16] we've got two in college and one in high school.
[02:24:20] And there where we're doing it.
[02:24:21] We sat down as a family and we talked about it.
[02:24:23] We had to make sure everybody was good to go with it.
[02:24:27] And, you know, to varying degrees to, you know,
[02:24:31] what does my 15 year old know about it?
[02:24:33] You know, he gets a large degree, you know,
[02:24:36] he was, since he was, you know, that tall, you know,
[02:24:42] he was, dad, this is made in China in it.
[02:24:44] That's not right, you know.
[02:24:47] So he gets a lot of things and he gets this to a degree.
[02:24:50] My older sons helped me write stuff, you know,
[02:24:52] he helped me write that pledge, you know,
[02:24:53] may take an ownership of the condition of our country
[02:24:57] because I have not participated, you know, in this.
[02:24:59] I've always served, but never this.
[02:25:01] He helped me write that.
[02:25:02] He helped me write my first speech.
[02:25:04] No one could write for me.
[02:25:05] It all comes from the heart.
[02:25:07] I free flow just about everything
[02:25:10] because it's from the heart.
[02:25:11] It's legit.
[02:25:12] You know, this is not what I would normally do, you know.
[02:25:17] I say it over and over again too, you know,
[02:25:19] I grade my church driveway, you know,
[02:25:21] I show up there when nobody's there, you know,
[02:25:23] and I grade it.
[02:25:25] It's a steep dirt hill and make it all pretty again,
[02:25:30] load my tractor up and I go away before anybody comes back.
[02:25:33] And now I'm doing a selfie while I'm doing it.
[02:25:35] That is not who I am.
[02:25:37] It is now.
[02:25:40] Was there a straw that broke the camel's back
[02:25:42] as far as making you say, yeah, I'll do it?
[02:25:45] Or was the straw just your wife said, you better do this?
[02:25:48] It's all the crazy divisiveness, you know.
[02:25:50] In Sears school, you know, we actually taught
[02:25:55] how not to get indoctrinated and not,
[02:25:57] how not to allow these divisions happen
[02:26:00] while you're a captive.
[02:26:01] You know, in the Korean War, there were 14 Americans
[02:26:05] that were taught in captivity that America's bad
[02:26:08] and they did not, these captors convinced them
[02:26:12] to stay in North Korea.
[02:26:13] That's insane.
[02:26:15] That's happening here in America.
[02:26:16] How many ways are they trying to divide people?
[02:26:18] Whether you're vaccinated and unvaccinated,
[02:26:20] you're taught you're bad and evil if you're not vaccinated.
[02:26:23] And you're taught, you know,
[02:26:26] you deny the election or you think we need an election
[02:26:30] integrity to take a look at the election, you know,
[02:26:33] then you're a traitor to the country.
[02:26:36] Hey, let's just take a look at it.
[02:26:37] Make sure the people that think it was stolen understand it.
[02:26:41] You know, I'll take that's an okay stance to have.
[02:26:44] All this division in the country is insane.
[02:26:47] It's not comfortable.
[02:26:49] You know, I've complained about it
[02:26:51] and it's the only thing I can do to make it right.
[02:26:56] So we're stepping up and we're definitely stepping up
[02:26:58] as a family.
[02:26:59] My wife is a huge part of the campaign.
[02:27:02] I mean, driving force and couldn't do it.
[02:27:06] You know, wouldn't want to do it without family buy-in.
[02:27:09] But yeah, it's a legit push, you know,
[02:27:13] I was gonna go get my commercial pilot's license.
[02:27:15] I was gonna do one more thing that was gonna be fun.
[02:27:17] I had Joy flying.
[02:27:19] That's on hold for a little bit.
[02:27:20] What's been the biggest surprise
[02:27:22] about entering the political arena?
[02:27:25] Confirming all that divisiveness, you know,
[02:27:28] because I walk up and I will talk to anybody.
[02:27:31] I go to these fairs, all the farm fairs and all that,
[02:27:37] agricultural fairs and I walk, I give my spiel.
[02:27:42] You know, I always start with a retired Navy SEAL
[02:27:45] because no one wants to talk to a politician
[02:27:46] and I am definitely not that.
[02:27:48] So I said, I'm at the Atlanta Retired Navy SEAL
[02:27:51] running for U.S. Congress.
[02:27:52] You have time for me to tell you about the campaign?
[02:27:54] Great, I did 21 years in the Navy,
[02:27:56] all of the SEAL teams, I'm a volunteer firefighter,
[02:27:58] I'm a reserve deputy sheriff.
[02:28:00] I never wanted to run for office, I'm running
[02:28:02] because I was asked to.
[02:28:04] And the guy goes, oh, hey, that sounds great.
[02:28:09] Who's the president of the United States?
[02:28:10] You know, I have to like it,
[02:28:14] but Joe Biden's the president of the United States.
[02:28:16] And he asked me, you know, was the election stolen again?
[02:28:21] And I go, hey, we need to work on election integrity
[02:28:24] so everybody's comfortable with the results of the election.
[02:28:27] You know, whatever happened,
[02:28:29] everybody denies that the election,
[02:28:31] you know, Hillary Clinton, you know,
[02:28:33] is still denying that her election was legitimate.
[02:28:37] You know, the hanging chads and floor, all that stuff.
[02:28:41] We gotta have something.
[02:28:42] That man called me a traitor.
[02:28:45] Volunteer firefighter, reserve deputy sheriff,
[02:28:47] 21 years in the SEAL teams.
[02:28:49] I want to check the election integrity
[02:28:51] so everybody's comfortable and I'm a traitor.
[02:28:54] Not cool.
[02:28:56] So a lot of that, you know,
[02:28:59] building the campaigns pretty wild, you know,
[02:29:01] we're definitely money visits main.
[02:29:05] It doesn't stay there so we don't get, you know,
[02:29:06] the donations don't flow in.
[02:29:09] Although we're working our tail off.
[02:29:11] We're out raising, you know,
[02:29:13] somebody's been in DC for 14 years.
[02:29:17] It had been in politics for 30 plus years
[02:29:19] and we're out raising our three to one in human money.
[02:29:22] But she gets 91% from PACs and, you know,
[02:29:25] so she's got smoke in us and coin.
[02:29:28] You know, and mostly out of state.
[02:29:32] That's a wild thing, you know,
[02:29:33] cause you can look at all that stuff in the FEC website.
[02:29:36] That was a second quarter file.
[02:29:38] That's gotta be like just so crazy to think
[02:29:42] if you live in Maine, which obviously I got companies
[02:29:44] up in Maine, you know, but, and I don't live there,
[02:29:47] but if you live in Maine and you think that the people
[02:29:50] that are trying to get someone elected don't live in Maine
[02:29:54] and have no interest in Maine,
[02:29:55] but they wanna wanna change what people are gonna vote for.
[02:30:00] That's kinda crazy, right?
[02:30:01] Yeah, and I don't know the right answer to fix that, you know?
[02:30:04] And that was actually started by a Republican,
[02:30:06] you know, the super PAC thing, which is, you know,
[02:30:09] they can do unlimited expenditures in your name.
[02:30:12] It's, no, definitely not right.
[02:30:16] And I, you know, I'm definitely the weirdo.
[02:30:18] I'm gonna probably go a lot, learning about who I am also.
[02:30:23] Because I've never put full thought
[02:30:25] into all these ideas that conservatives have.
[02:30:28] And now I have to, because it comes out of my mouth,
[02:30:32] and it's on film or recorded forever.
[02:30:36] And so, you know, and it's also, you really have to think
[02:30:39] about, you know, just like when I was in the platoon
[02:30:42] and I became the recce guy, you know, squad,
[02:30:46] and now I'm the task unit, you know,
[02:30:48] or the whole task unit, those are all my folks now, you know?
[02:30:53] So now I'm representing all of district one,
[02:30:56] and I will represent district one.
[02:30:59] So I gotta think about, you know,
[02:31:01] what's gonna be right for everybody.
[02:31:03] And, you know, I'll admit default.
[02:31:05] I'm not, you know, that's how we fix things.
[02:31:08] That's how we fix things in the teams and military.
[02:31:10] If you can't say, hey, let's look at the result of that.
[02:31:15] And, oh, that might have not been the right thing.
[02:31:20] You're gonna keep going down there.
[02:31:22] Politicians never do that.
[02:31:24] They never admit to wrong.
[02:31:27] I'm not that guy.
[02:31:28] I am not polished.
[02:31:30] But I've never run for office.
[02:31:32] You'll notice I am, and, you know, and, hey, check.
[02:31:37] But I'm honest, and I'll keep my integrity.
[02:31:42] You know, I'll keep my beliefs.
[02:31:44] And learning a lot about me is part of it
[02:31:50] because you really have to think your decisions
[02:31:55] are gonna weigh in and make affect lives.
[02:32:00] Yeah, it's crazy with the politicians.
[02:32:01] The number one to come out and say,
[02:32:04] hey, this is the right answer.
[02:32:07] About whatever.
[02:32:08] You can say it about anything.
[02:32:09] Right, right, right.
[02:32:10] And anything, like, hey, this is the right answer.
[02:32:11] This is what we need to do.
[02:32:12] And then it doesn't work out as good
[02:32:14] as they thought it would, or maybe it's even bad,
[02:32:16] or whatever, but instead of saying,
[02:32:18] hey, you know what, that is what I thought we should do.
[02:32:20] It turns out there were some other factors
[02:32:22] that were involved, and here's some adjustments
[02:32:24] we need to make.
[02:32:25] Instead, they just ride that parachute into the ground,
[02:32:28] right?
[02:32:29] Like, hey, this is the plan I came up with.
[02:32:30] We're sticking with it.
[02:32:32] And even when you come up with something,
[02:32:34] I've been in leadership positions for a long time now.
[02:32:37] I mean, I guess for at least 25 years
[02:32:40] or something like that.
[02:32:41] I've been in leadership positions.
[02:32:43] And to say, hey, this is 100% right,
[02:32:49] everyone else should be quiet is such a bad move.
[02:32:52] Because the chances that you're so smart,
[02:32:54] or that I'm so smart, that I'm gonna figure out
[02:32:56] the best way to conduct this operation,
[02:32:58] I'm gonna figure out the best solution
[02:32:59] to this business problem we're having,
[02:33:01] or I'm gonna come up with the problem-solving move over here.
[02:33:07] The chances that I am just so smart
[02:33:10] that I figure it all out.
[02:33:11] No one else can figure it out,
[02:33:12] but I figured it all out.
[02:33:13] And by the way, when I figured out,
[02:33:15] I calculate all the variables in the future.
[02:33:19] Right, that's what I'm, I'm so smart
[02:33:21] that I figure out all the future variables.
[02:33:23] And I'm gonna get all those right as well.
[02:33:25] That's how smart I am.
[02:33:27] So why would you make statements
[02:33:29] that you're 100% right about anything?
[02:33:31] It's a dumb move.
[02:33:32] And then when you're not, which is okay,
[02:33:34] right, why would you not say, hey, you know what?
[02:33:36] Here's what I thought was gonna happen.
[02:33:38] Here's the plan we went with
[02:33:40] because of that's what I thought,
[02:33:41] and that was the consensus, and then it was wrong,
[02:33:44] and here's the adjustments we're gonna make.
[02:33:45] No big deal.
[02:33:46] Right.
[02:33:47] No big deal.
[02:33:48] I've worked for bosses, and I know you've worked for bosses
[02:33:50] that pretended like or thought
[02:33:52] that they had the 100% solution.
[02:33:54] And then they won't back down from their decision,
[02:33:58] even when it's wrong.
[02:34:00] And they think their respect is gonna go down,
[02:34:04] that people respect them less if they say, hey, I was wrong.
[02:34:06] But it's absolutely the opposite is true.
[02:34:09] When I say, hey, I screwed this up,
[02:34:11] people go, oh, okay, police, Jock was humble enough
[02:34:12] to admit that he was wrong,
[02:34:13] and he's gonna make some adjustments now.
[02:34:15] Nothing wrong with that.
[02:34:16] We haven't, politicians have not learned that lesson yet.
[02:34:19] Right.
[02:34:22] The fear of the sound bite, the fear that, you know,
[02:34:26] well, you should step down
[02:34:27] because you made that bad decision.
[02:34:29] No, that was a wrong decision.
[02:34:33] I admit it's wrong.
[02:34:34] We're gonna move forward.
[02:34:35] And, you know, I'll make mistakes.
[02:34:38] And I'll admit it and we'll figure something out
[02:34:41] to find what's better.
[02:34:43] But that's not happening right now.
[02:34:45] It's not happening and it's got to, you know,
[02:34:48] if anybody thinks it was okay to mask kids up
[02:34:52] that are, you know, born when this thing started
[02:34:55] and they've never seen a human face
[02:34:58] except their parents for two plus years, that's insane.
[02:35:02] Hey, you know, the development, you know,
[02:35:06] been slowed down in all our children.
[02:35:08] And was that really worth it?
[02:35:10] You know, was that worth shutting down businesses?
[02:35:14] You know, we got folks that their business was shut down
[02:35:19] and they sold out and they're never gonna
[02:35:21] open them back up again.
[02:35:23] And was that really worth it?
[02:35:26] You know, while saying that everybody can go to work
[02:35:28] in the big box stores and you're actually having
[02:35:30] more people in the big box stores?
[02:35:32] Is that right?
[02:35:34] You know, instead of spreading it out
[02:35:36] to all the other stores while keeping them
[02:35:38] because that's a human, that's that individual's decision.
[02:35:42] Yeah.
[02:35:43] And you go, look, sometimes you're in a scenario
[02:35:46] you don't know what's gonna happen.
[02:35:48] Like, hey, there's a bunch of people dying in Adelaide.
[02:35:50] Like, okay, well, we're gonna lock some stuff down here.
[02:35:53] Okay, well, okay, got it.
[02:35:56] And then like a few weeks go by and then a month goes by
[02:35:59] and you say, hey, it seems like in other areas of the world
[02:36:02] this isn't that bad and all of a sudden you can't,
[02:36:07] no one says, hey, we need to adjust our thought process
[02:36:10] right now.
[02:36:11] Right.
[02:36:12] We made some rash decisions early on
[02:36:14] because we didn't know what was going on.
[02:36:16] And you know, if you're my boss and you make a rash decision
[02:36:20] because you don't know what's going on
[02:36:21] and I don't know what's going on, I go, okay, well,
[02:36:22] hey man, let's give it a try.
[02:36:24] So no one knows what's happening.
[02:36:26] Let's err on the side of safety.
[02:36:29] But then when you start seeing, you know,
[02:36:31] other information come in and you say, wait a second,
[02:36:33] this doesn't seem like it's as bad.
[02:36:35] And we had people just holding the line on stuff
[02:36:38] that didn't make any sense.
[02:36:39] I mean, there's some kind of a,
[02:36:41] there's something in California going on right now
[02:36:44] where the Indian casinos stayed open.
[02:36:50] And the other casinos are mad.
[02:36:53] I don't know if I know enough about it to talk about
[02:36:56] because I saw an advertisement or read an advertisement
[02:37:00] about it, but the other casinos are mad that they were open
[02:37:04] and that they were able to make money.
[02:37:05] They said, they profited when the other casinos shut down
[02:37:08] and I'm like, thinking to myself, hey,
[02:37:11] if I was in charge of a casino
[02:37:13] and there was a bunch of casinos that were open
[02:37:15] and everything was okay, that seems like an indicator to me
[02:37:19] that maybe it's okay.
[02:37:20] Like when we had the Super Bowl in Los Angeles, California
[02:37:23] and there was 90,000 people in the arena
[02:37:27] and it was no super spreader, there wasn't a bunch of people.
[02:37:32] And yet they went back to masks again.
[02:37:34] It was like, you can't make this up.
[02:37:36] Right.
[02:37:38] The roller coaster of, you must do this
[02:37:44] and then you see the politician doing that,
[02:37:47] doing exactly what they said, don't do.
[02:37:50] And it's like, hey, it's very disturbing.
[02:37:55] Yeah, it's very disturbing.
[02:37:58] And again, I have the, well, I live in California,
[02:38:02] Echo Charles lives in California,
[02:38:03] where we were like ground zero
[02:38:05] for the politicians saying one thing
[02:38:07] and doing something completely different,
[02:38:10] which you can, Americans will only stand for that stuff
[02:38:16] for so long.
[02:38:18] And it was actually longer than I thought in many cases.
[02:38:21] It was sometimes like, hey man,
[02:38:23] like, we had a revolution against England
[02:38:31] because they raised the taxes two cents on our bushels of tea.
[02:38:36] And we're like, all right, you know what, that's enough.
[02:38:38] We're done.
[02:38:39] You know?
[02:38:40] And so there's only so much Americans can take.
[02:38:43] I think they definitely got pushed to the limit of that.
[02:38:46] They took more than I thought, you know?
[02:38:48] Especially as time dragged on.
[02:38:51] But what's really disturbing is just the decisive,
[02:38:55] the divisiveness that you mentioned already,
[02:38:59] where it's like, well, it doesn't seem like in retrospect
[02:39:03] that putting masks on little kids was a good idea
[02:39:07] for two years.
[02:39:09] And inside of people going, yeah,
[02:39:10] that definitely seems like it was a bad idea
[02:39:12] and we should try and learn from that in the future.
[02:39:14] Instead they're like, no.
[02:39:16] Right, no.
[02:39:17] You're like, hey man, what reality are you in?
[02:39:21] Right.
[02:39:22] What reality are you in?
[02:39:23] Well, watching them from afar dump sand
[02:39:28] in the skate parks of California.
[02:39:31] And put two by fours across basketball hoops.
[02:39:34] And I was up in Baxter State Park.
[02:39:40] It's a 13 mile ski uphill to get where you can stay
[02:39:45] and sleep for, take a break.
[02:39:48] And then it's another three miles up much steeper terrain
[02:39:52] to where you're gonna start to do actual,
[02:39:54] you know, ice climbing and all that.
[02:39:57] So we made it 16 miles in uphill.
[02:40:01] There's nobody in the park.
[02:40:03] You know, that's the cool thing about Baxter
[02:40:05] is in the winter is you cannot drive in there.
[02:40:09] You've got very limited people
[02:40:11] and they only allow so many people in there.
[02:40:13] We're away from everybody.
[02:40:16] Park Ranger comes up very sad.
[02:40:19] You have to go home now.
[02:40:21] We just made it here.
[02:40:24] There's nobody, there's nobody within, you know,
[02:40:27] 50 miles from us.
[02:40:28] I mean, you know, and so we had to, you know,
[02:40:33] ski out of, you know, back down the hill of the mountain.
[02:40:39] And that was so insanely disturbing.
[02:40:43] And it came down from the Secretary of State,
[02:40:46] I believe is what they said.
[02:40:48] And that was so, we were isolated.
[02:40:52] We were away from everybody.
[02:40:54] You know, a lot of this has to do with the ecosystem
[02:40:59] that, and really the digital ecosystem
[02:41:03] that a human being lives within.
[02:41:04] Right.
[02:41:05] Because I know people that were in the ecosystem of,
[02:41:10] you know, COVID was the most heinous disease
[02:41:15] that ever came to the world.
[02:41:18] And these are people that are friends that I know
[02:41:20] are normal, like logical people,
[02:41:23] but their digital ecosystem,
[02:41:26] the word inside there, the truth inside
[02:41:30] that digital ecosystem was just so closed loop
[02:41:35] that there was no other perspectives coming in whatsoever.
[02:41:39] And it was very disturbing to see,
[02:41:43] to see people that their world was so closed loop
[02:41:51] that they couldn't comprehend another viewpoint at all.
[02:41:56] And part of that ecosystem was to protect itself
[02:42:01] from outside thought.
[02:42:02] And so anybody that offered some other perspective
[02:42:05] was immediately attacked.
[02:42:08] Right.
[02:42:08] It wasn't a, you couldn't have a conversation
[02:42:11] with someone in that other ecosystem.
[02:42:13] You couldn't have a conversation with them about it
[02:42:15] because they would go on the attack
[02:42:20] and they would utilize the truths in air quotes,
[02:42:25] the supposed truths from inside their ecosystem,
[02:42:28] which they truly believed that they were true.
[02:42:32] And it was, honestly, it was very sad to see.
[02:42:36] It was very sad to see people going through that.
[02:42:39] And I would try and address it a little bit with people,
[02:42:44] maybe mention to them something from outside
[02:42:47] their closed loop and they would go on the attack
[02:42:51] and go super defensive and it wasn't worth it.
[02:42:54] I want to maintain a relationship with a person
[02:42:56] that I've known for 10 years or 12 years or 20 years.
[02:42:58] They're your friend.
[02:43:00] And I don't want to fight with them over this thing.
[02:43:03] It's like, okay, if you want to continue to live,
[02:43:05] like literally quarantine yourself inside your house
[02:43:09] and we met at an outdoor place to say hi
[02:43:15] and just mentioning that, well, hey,
[02:43:17] just so you know, like I'm training Jiu-Jitsu.
[02:43:20] Right, and I've been training Jiu-Jitsu with my friends
[02:43:22] and all the time and like none of us are sick
[02:43:25] and everyone's okay and just to see the look of horror
[02:43:28] in their eyes, almost as if I was one
[02:43:32] of the worst human beings ever,
[02:43:34] it was really sad to see, but again,
[02:43:37] I think a lot of it has to do with,
[02:43:40] you know, you got to open up your perspective.
[02:43:42] You know, you got to open up your perspective
[02:43:44] and you got to listen to more than one
[02:43:48] more than one ecosystem of information.
[02:43:51] Otherwise, you're not seeing everything.
[02:43:53] And look, you can go far to the other side
[02:43:55] of the spectrum as well.
[02:43:57] And you can get just as wrapped up in that ecosystem
[02:44:00] where you don't listen to anybody else.
[02:44:02] So it's a very strange time and I think, you know,
[02:44:08] I always find that people run into a problem
[02:44:11] with their ego, right?
[02:44:12] Same thing that we just talked about
[02:44:13] if I'm a politician.
[02:44:13] My ego won't allow me to say I was wrong.
[02:44:16] My ego won't allow me to say,
[02:44:18] hey, I don't know what to do,
[02:44:19] but this is what I think we should do.
[02:44:21] Let's try this.
[02:44:22] My ego says, no, you know everything.
[02:44:23] I know everything.
[02:44:25] I'm not gonna make any mistakes.
[02:44:27] Well, the same thing happens
[02:44:28] when it comes to processing information.
[02:44:30] You get your root idea that you believe
[02:44:34] and you don't want to admit,
[02:44:36] hey, you know what?
[02:44:37] I was actually wrong about that.
[02:44:38] I was actually, that wasn't a good idea.
[02:44:40] Or you know what?
[02:44:41] That's what I thought a month ago.
[02:44:44] And clearly there's new information
[02:44:46] that I should process and pay attention to.
[02:44:48] And people just unfortunately aren't thinking
[02:44:51] that way anymore.
[02:44:52] And it's like this weird tribalism
[02:44:54] that takes hold that's crazy to see.
[02:44:57] It's gonna be Rwanda, dude.
[02:45:00] You have to know somebody
[02:45:01] to actually know that they're different than you.
[02:45:03] And that didn't go very well.
[02:45:06] I mean, they had to know each other.
[02:45:08] What's going on with the lobstermen up in Maine?
[02:45:12] I'll tell you what.
[02:45:12] Just because I look, this is such a huge deal in Maine.
[02:45:17] What is this?
[02:45:18] A $2 billion industry in Maine?
[02:45:20] $2 billion, yeah.
[02:45:22] $2 billion industry.
[02:45:23] This is, when you think of Maine, you think lobster.
[02:45:29] Of course, hey, I hope you think OriginUSA.
[02:45:32] I hope you think about making jeans, right?
[02:45:34] 100%.
[02:45:35] I hope you think about boots.
[02:45:36] I hope you think about the best Jujutsu geese in the world.
[02:45:38] You're gonna think about that stuff too.
[02:45:39] But before that, I have to admit,
[02:45:42] you're thinking about lobster
[02:45:44] because Maine is the epicenter of lobster.
[02:45:49] It's life in Maine.
[02:45:52] And so what is going on?
[02:45:54] Yeah, no one wants a Massachusetts or a Canadian lobster.
[02:45:57] I've never seen an advertisement
[02:45:59] for fresh Massachusetts lobster, right?
[02:46:02] No, they want Maine lobster.
[02:46:03] No offense to Massachusetts.
[02:46:05] No offense to Canada, but you want Maine lobster.
[02:46:08] So they're coming up with all these ideas,
[02:46:11] the right whale up there,
[02:46:13] which is not even in the Maine waters.
[02:46:15] They haven't seen it.
[02:46:16] And they had an entanglement.
[02:46:19] Hold on, I'm just gonna clarify this.
[02:46:20] So it's called the right whale.
[02:46:21] This is a breed of whale called the right whale.
[02:46:25] Yeah, it writes itself, when it dies,
[02:46:28] it writes itself in the water and it floats.
[02:46:32] So if there are a whole bunch of dead right whales,
[02:46:35] they're gonna all be floating.
[02:46:36] You know, they actually, history,
[02:46:39] they used to chunk it up and bring it on the ship in pieces
[02:46:43] because it would be just floating there.
[02:46:45] And that's the other part of the,
[02:46:48] one of the parts of,
[02:46:49] hey, it doesn't make sense what you guys are talking about.
[02:46:54] They're coming up with all these ideas to,
[02:46:57] save the right whale,
[02:46:58] but they're looking at the lobster man.
[02:47:00] The lobster man, not the problem.
[02:47:02] Everything from the size of the pectoral fin,
[02:47:05] and they don't have a notch in it,
[02:47:06] where the humpback whale has a notch
[02:47:09] and a huge pectoral fin that would get caught
[02:47:11] in a horizontal rope.
[02:47:13] All these things they wanna do don't need to be done.
[02:47:16] It's ship strikes that kills them.
[02:47:18] And it's Canadian snow crab gear that does it.
[02:47:22] The main lobster man have done all these things
[02:47:25] to take care of it and get it out of the way.
[02:47:27] And some of the things that they do, for instance,
[02:47:29] is they put like breakaways in the lines, right?
[02:47:32] So if I was a right whale,
[02:47:34] and I got caught up in a main lobster man's line,
[02:47:39] it's designed to break.
[02:47:41] And I get out and I'm fine.
[02:47:43] You're good.
[02:47:44] And they've already done that.
[02:47:45] They've already done that.
[02:47:46] Well, all the ropes are all identified.
[02:47:48] So if it does get caught in a main lobster man gear,
[02:47:52] it's identified as main lobster gear.
[02:47:55] And they put several breaks in it.
[02:47:57] It's all been done and taken care of.
[02:48:00] And it really was, hasn't been a problem ever.
[02:48:04] But the National Marine Fisheries Services,
[02:48:10] they made a decision that if a whale dies in Canada,
[02:48:16] we take credit for it.
[02:48:17] We're half credit for it.
[02:48:19] So one died there and we're getting blamed
[02:48:22] and we're gonna shut down our industry.
[02:48:24] And no one made, they're under NOAA, right?
[02:48:27] Explain what NOAA is.
[02:48:28] Yeah, NOAA.
[02:48:29] Yep, National Oceanographic Atmospheric Administration.
[02:48:34] And it's everything from mapping and weather in the ocean.
[02:48:38] And they have subcategories.
[02:48:40] And one is National Marine Fisheries Services.
[02:48:45] And they came up with this study,
[02:48:50] and there's cryptic deaths.
[02:48:53] So if they get one death, they assume there's three more,
[02:48:57] even though these things are gonna float.
[02:48:59] And they stopped, they had crews that were
[02:49:04] detanglement crews, well, they disband them all
[02:49:06] because they're not entanglements.
[02:49:08] They had observers out there
[02:49:11] or they don't have any observers anymore
[02:49:13] because they're not there.
[02:49:15] And still they're trying to get them to modify things
[02:49:18] in a manner that will shut the industry down.
[02:49:21] So give me an example of what the NOAA,
[02:49:25] what do they wanna modify for the lobstermen?
[02:49:29] They're really trying to get them to bite in
[02:49:31] and weigh in on the decisions that are gonna harm them.
[02:49:35] So closures of the prime areas.
[02:49:38] So prime areas of where you drop lobster pots
[02:49:45] and catch lobsters, they wanna shut them down.
[02:49:47] They wanna shut them down, they wanna try ropless gear,
[02:49:51] which is, in the short, remote control,
[02:49:54] a buoy pops up from the trap
[02:49:56] and you've got 10 to 20 traps strung out
[02:49:58] and you're gonna count that this,
[02:50:01] you're dropping it in,
[02:50:02] no one's gonna know where the traps are
[02:50:05] because you might drop them in six knots of current
[02:50:08] in a string and they're gonna drop 150 feet,
[02:50:13] even further.
[02:50:15] How much does a lobster trap
[02:50:18] with some kind of a radio activated?
[02:50:20] Or a sonar activated to get the buoy to pop up?
[02:50:24] Yeah, it's gonna be,
[02:50:25] whatever they end up doing,
[02:50:29] they're about four grand.
[02:50:31] A regular lobster buoy, 10 bucks.
[02:50:34] So who's gonna be able to do that?
[02:50:36] It's gonna be big giant,
[02:50:41] big box store, Walmart, China,
[02:50:43] taking over our lobster industry, can't happen.
[02:50:47] Because regular mom and pop can't do that,
[02:50:51] absorb that cost.
[02:50:54] We were looking at getting another seafood processing plant
[02:50:58] built in Maine instead of shipping it up to Canada
[02:51:02] and that's just like the oil industry,
[02:51:05] they're not gonna build another refinery
[02:51:08] because they can't have a guarantee that
[02:51:10] the oil industry is gonna be around.
[02:51:14] Just so they're not building that seafood processing plant.
[02:51:19] There's a whole other slew of jobs in the construction
[02:51:21] and running of that that are gone.
[02:51:27] It's gonna have a crazy ripple effect across Maine.
[02:51:30] When people come there, to go to Reds Eats
[02:51:34] and stand an hour and a half in a line,
[02:51:37] they'll go eat a lobster roll.
[02:51:40] Yeah, like I said, when you think of Maine,
[02:51:43] you think of lobster 100%.
[02:51:46] Yeah.
[02:51:46] So to shut this down would be insane.
[02:51:48] So what will you be able to do when you're elected?
[02:51:53] Well, the voice has to come out loud.
[02:51:57] You know, we're gonna look at cutting funding
[02:52:01] for the piece that's causing the problem.
[02:52:05] They got a job to do, I got it,
[02:52:07] but if they're looking at it,
[02:52:09] and if they're looking at the lobstermen
[02:52:11] and they're not looking at where they need to look,
[02:52:14] then they're killing right whales
[02:52:16] by accusing the lobstermen of being the culprit.
[02:52:20] You know, once you focus in on one thing,
[02:52:24] you're not looking to take care of the problem.
[02:52:26] You know, it's ship strikes and a lot of pleasure crafts
[02:52:31] and folks trying to get too close to the whales,
[02:52:34] but it's not the Maine lobstermen.
[02:52:36] It's snow crab traps way up in Canada.
[02:52:40] And we get accounted for, like I said earlier,
[02:52:43] death there, that's insane.
[02:52:47] And that's America doing it.
[02:52:50] That's NOAA, that's National Marine Fisheries Services
[02:52:53] doing that.
[02:52:54] Why is this happening?
[02:52:57] Okay, so if I'm, let's say I love animals, which I do.
[02:53:02] Let's say I love whales, which I guess I kind of love whales.
[02:53:04] I mean, whales are cool animals.
[02:53:06] I mean, I can see them from my house and it's awesome.
[02:53:09] You know, I look out and we can see them sprain
[02:53:11] and we see, they come pretty close to the lineup
[02:53:14] sometimes surfing.
[02:53:15] It's pretty awesome.
[02:53:18] So let's say I do, whales are awesome.
[02:53:21] I wanna protect whales.
[02:53:22] And then I start going, oh, well,
[02:53:23] maybe these lobster traps could kill them
[02:53:25] and that seems bad.
[02:53:26] And then I start doing the research
[02:53:29] and I see that they can break out of the lines
[02:53:31] if they get tangled,
[02:53:31] because we put this into place.
[02:53:33] I see that they're counting, what'd you say, mystery deaths?
[02:53:37] Cryptic, they call it cryptic death.
[02:53:39] So if they find one dead, they say there's three more.
[02:53:42] Okay, so now I say I've got, I'm multiplying.
[02:53:46] When I start running the numbers on this,
[02:53:49] it doesn't make any sense to do that
[02:53:51] because this whale floats.
[02:53:52] So why would we say that it's dead?
[02:53:55] So as I start looking at this, I start saying,
[02:53:56] well, this doesn't seem like it's a problem.
[02:53:58] Let's focus on, you know, some other issue
[02:54:01] because apparently the, because it is apparent
[02:54:04] that the lobster traps and the lobster men
[02:54:07] are not the problem.
[02:54:09] So why are they not making this connection?
[02:54:13] Why are they continue to go down this path
[02:54:15] which there's evidence, clear evidence
[02:54:17] that this isn't a problem?
[02:54:19] Well, because you can't have windmills where you're lobstering
[02:54:23] and they want to put windmills in those areas.
[02:54:25] And hey, if they make sense, cool.
[02:54:29] Right now they do not make sense
[02:54:31] and you don't make up a lie, you know,
[02:54:33] even if it's right, the windmills,
[02:54:35] but you make up a lie to make it happen, that's wrong.
[02:54:38] Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that the reason
[02:54:40] that they want to do this is to,
[02:54:41] because they can put windmills out there?
[02:54:43] Can I say that 100% because,
[02:54:45] but that's where they want to put them, you know.
[02:54:48] Okay, so you're saying there is a plan to put windmills
[02:54:52] out in that section of the ocean.
[02:54:54] And it's the, they want to do it on the sea mounts,
[02:55:00] the mountains in the sea
[02:55:00] because that's where all the sea life goes
[02:55:03] because you put the shortest chain on those.
[02:55:06] These are three to one ratio chains, nine foot lengths,
[02:55:11] and 50 fathoms, you know, I think it's 50 fathoms,
[02:55:16] you know, 300 feet, and that's going to rake
[02:55:20] and destroy the bottom and then they're going
[02:55:23] to run horizontal lines.
[02:55:26] You know.
[02:55:27] To get the power back.
[02:55:27] Yeah, to get, well, to string these things together.
[02:55:30] And, you know, that'll catch a right whale
[02:55:34] because they get caught in their mouth.
[02:55:36] And all the pictures that they keep showing
[02:55:38] of the right whale with entanglements,
[02:55:41] you know, it's never been our lobster gear.
[02:55:46] It's bigger braided line and not the problem.
[02:55:51] You know, it's, yeah, you got to really look at it.
[02:55:55] None of it makes sense.
[02:55:56] You know, none of it makes sense
[02:55:58] and no one's going back and saying,
[02:56:00] hey, let's reassess this.
[02:56:03] You know, it should have never gotten to this point.
[02:56:05] They're looking to start and shut things down next month.
[02:56:08] You know, hey, we're going to do a lawsuit.
[02:56:10] Yeah, well, it's getting shut down.
[02:56:12] Who's doing a lawsuit?
[02:56:14] They're saying that the state's going to.
[02:56:18] The lobsterman did one and took it to court.
[02:56:22] And it's all the cryptic deaths.
[02:56:27] And the, you know, we were us taking credit
[02:56:30] for half of theirs.
[02:56:31] They want a 90% reduction in deaths.
[02:56:36] Yet windmills, you know, the new vineyard wind farm
[02:56:41] down in mass.
[02:56:43] They get to do 20 takes.
[02:56:46] It's level B harassment, which is.
[02:56:49] But what's 20 takes?
[02:56:51] What does that mean?
[02:56:52] Taking by level B harassment.
[02:56:53] You can harass them.
[02:56:55] And if it gets taken, you had permission to harass it.
[02:57:00] So you can stop them from breathing, you know,
[02:57:03] by not allowing them to come to surface.
[02:57:06] You can stop them from mating.
[02:57:08] You can stop them from sheltering.
[02:57:10] You can disrupt their migratory path.
[02:57:14] So.
[02:57:15] You can do all that to the whales?
[02:57:17] The windmills can.
[02:57:19] Cause they're going to do some blasting.
[02:57:21] They've got to do some sonic testing.
[02:57:24] Just a vibration of the, you know,
[02:57:25] what is the windmill itself going to do?
[02:57:29] And if you multiply that times all the windmills
[02:57:31] up and down the coast, that's more right whales
[02:57:36] than are alive as they count them.
[02:57:39] You know, so again, it doesn't make sense.
[02:57:42] It's not about the lobster man, you know,
[02:57:45] take a look at it and everybody jump on board, you know,
[02:57:50] cause you know, they're, you know, it's so frustrating.
[02:57:56] And you can look at me as crazy you want,
[02:57:58] cause it's that crazy.
[02:57:59] It doesn't make sense.
[02:58:00] And it's moving forward.
[02:58:04] Crazy.
[02:58:05] That's why we're running.
[02:58:06] Yeah.
[02:58:07] Cause there's so much that, that, you know,
[02:58:10] we just got to, and I don't know what I'm going to do.
[02:58:12] You know, I know I'm going to butt heads
[02:58:14] in my own party too.
[02:58:16] Cause I'm that guy.
[02:58:18] If it doesn't make sense, it doesn't make sense, you know,
[02:58:20] and it's about the country, you know,
[02:58:22] it's never about your platoon.
[02:58:25] You're going to fight for your platoon,
[02:58:26] your task unit, your team.
[02:58:27] But in the end, you don't do anything.
[02:58:30] That competitiveness in a platoon and task unit,
[02:58:33] it never supersedes your, your task in the country.
[02:58:38] You know, I love the competitiveness in a platoon.
[02:58:41] You know, it's, it's awesome.
[02:58:43] Cause you're all fighting.
[02:58:44] You all want to be the, you know, when,
[02:58:46] when the building's burning, you want to be, you know,
[02:58:50] the squad that gets called to go in.
[02:58:51] And you don't, you know, firemen don't want the fire,
[02:58:55] but they're all, all the men are competing
[02:58:57] so that they can be the guy on the team
[02:58:59] that goes in and helps, right?
[02:59:02] But you never let that competitiveness, you know,
[02:59:04] it's like taking, you know, politicians are like taking
[02:59:07] the firing pins out of, you know, the rifles
[02:59:10] so that they, they, they look better than the other guy,
[02:59:13] you know, you know, it's, it's, it's like a sales team,
[02:59:18] you know, you know, cutting the cord to the copy machine
[02:59:21] before the other sales team gets to print out their,
[02:59:24] their briefs, you know, it's, that's the competitive
[02:59:27] that's going on in politics.
[02:59:28] It's, it's, I've got six years is what the,
[02:59:32] what the family agreed to is to do this for six years.
[02:59:36] And I believe in term limits, you know,
[02:59:38] I will definitely self-impose
[02:59:39] because I got an awesome life I want to get back to.
[02:59:41] And that's what, you've got an objective
[02:59:46] and when you, when you transfer to one command to the next,
[02:59:49] you know, you've got a limited time there
[02:59:51] and you're going to take that piece of string
[02:59:53] and you're going to pass it off as a rappel line
[02:59:55] and then pass it off as a howler's line.
[02:59:57] And, you know, you're going to have an objective
[03:00:00] at the end of that time that you're going to be successful.
[03:00:03] You're going to have made America better.
[03:00:06] And that's not happening.
[03:00:08] It's a whole bunch of politicking
[03:00:10] and a whole bunch of saber rattling to get the next,
[03:00:14] you know, election, you know, spun up, fund,
[03:00:18] you know, funded and everything else.
[03:00:21] Yeah, finding that common ground and getting it done.
[03:00:25] If they weren't so worried about getting their next,
[03:00:27] you know, seat in Congress, the next term set up,
[03:00:30] they probably wouldn't be spending money
[03:00:32] and sprinkling it all over the place, you know,
[03:00:34] making people happy with a little bit of money here,
[03:00:36] a little bit of money there.
[03:00:37] Hey, you know, this party's trying to do that to you
[03:00:41] and that party's trying to do this to you,
[03:00:43] you know, when that's not true, you know,
[03:00:47] definitely these hot button topics.
[03:00:51] You look at the mailers that come in, you know,
[03:00:54] where they're teaching hate, you know.
[03:00:58] And these are like mailers for different candidates
[03:01:02] up in Maine.
[03:01:03] Yeah, in Maine, everywhere.
[03:01:05] You know, you know, the,
[03:01:09] even broach the subject,
[03:01:10] because it's, you get demonized, you know, abortion, you know.
[03:01:14] One side thinks it's a baby,
[03:01:16] the other side thinks it's a woman's right.
[03:01:18] And basically that topic is either side thinks the other person's
[03:01:24] completely evil and that's not the case.
[03:01:28] Each side was taught something different, you know,
[03:01:32] you know, Republican women don't wanna take away
[03:01:34] women's rights, they're strong Republican women.
[03:01:37] And they're strong, they believe in women's rights,
[03:01:39] but they also believe it's a baby, you know.
[03:01:42] And on the other side, they were taught something different.
[03:01:47] And people are trying to make laws right now,
[03:01:51] they're saying they want to,
[03:01:52] but it's not legal to make a law federally about it
[03:01:58] because it just got, it has to go back
[03:01:59] through the Supreme Court.
[03:02:01] And both sides are saying the other side's gonna do something
[03:02:06] evil to your side.
[03:02:07] Well, no, you actually can't.
[03:02:09] So why are you campaigning on it?
[03:02:11] You know, and that's, I get,
[03:02:14] you will, this conversation is older, over, done.
[03:02:20] When I say, you know, my stance on it in pro life,
[03:02:23] but I will not legislate on it.
[03:02:26] I'll vote no, either way, it comes to me.
[03:02:29] You know, it's, I mean, saying this on air right now
[03:02:32] is crazy questionable
[03:02:34] because some people that will just shut down,
[03:02:37] shut down both sides, you know,
[03:02:41] because the people think I should take my position
[03:02:45] and use it to what they want, you know?
[03:02:48] But that's not constitutional.
[03:02:50] So your statement pisses everyone off.
[03:02:52] Yeah, yeah.
[03:02:54] So you got that going for you at the lender.
[03:02:56] But you know what, I'm honest about it.
[03:02:58] And it's not constitutive, it belongs at the state.
[03:03:01] That's how the country gets along
[03:03:02] is we have all these little countries
[03:03:04] that unified and became a federal republic.
[03:03:07] And, you know, there's different laws
[03:03:10] in Massachusetts and California and Maine
[03:03:14] and the people vote on them, the representatives,
[03:03:18] you know, represent them.
[03:03:20] And that's how we get along.
[03:03:22] Otherwise we would tear ourselves apart a long time ago.
[03:03:25] You know, and, you know, we're not going back to the 60s.
[03:03:29] You know, segregation, we're not, you know?
[03:03:31] That gets, I get so much gets thrown at me.
[03:03:34] And I'm just gonna be honest, you know?
[03:03:37] And it's that hate, and I mean it's hate.
[03:03:43] They're accusing one side or the other of, you know,
[03:03:50] taking away women's rights.
[03:03:52] The other side just thinks it's a baby.
[03:03:54] Everybody knows it's life.
[03:03:56] It's just when it's become human life.
[03:03:58] And we go so far left and right of it, you know?
[03:04:02] There's only three countries in the world
[03:04:04] that have late-term abortion, you know?
[03:04:09] China, North Korea, and America.
[03:04:12] And again, I don't care where anybody stands at.
[03:04:15] I don't hate anybody for their thought on it.
[03:04:17] I know that people have been taught different about it.
[03:04:20] You know, so I have no idea
[03:04:23] if we should be going down this route.
[03:04:25] Honestly, uh-uh, because it, it's crazy.
[03:04:31] I've been doing my lobster boat swims.
[03:04:33] Did I tell you about those?
[03:04:35] No, tell me about your lobster boat swims.
[03:04:36] My lobster boat swims.
[03:04:38] So I'm swimming, you know, they have the Lop,
[03:04:41] they had a rally, a concert on the water,
[03:04:43] all the lobsters come around.
[03:04:45] And 60 degree water, and I got my campaign material
[03:04:51] in a dry bag.
[03:04:53] And I'm swimming boat to boat, skinning it.
[03:04:55] And I'm, hey, I'm Ed Thielander,
[03:04:57] retired Navy SEAL, running for U.S. Congress.
[03:04:58] Mind if I come on board and tell you about the campaign?
[03:05:01] I hit 50 boats one day, like three and a half, four hours
[03:05:04] in the water.
[03:05:05] I did it five times.
[03:05:06] Swimming with the sharks.
[03:05:08] And, uh, and Harpswell, the great whites are out
[03:05:12] tearing SEALs apart, not this one.
[03:05:16] And, you know, I'm campaigning boat to boat again.
[03:05:20] And, you know, it's just neat getting a lot of love.
[03:05:24] And, yeah, hit the news guy.
[03:05:29] He's on the float.
[03:05:30] And, uh, I won't say what channel.
[03:05:33] I really want to.
[03:05:34] But, uh, you go, hey, I'm Ed, you know?
[03:05:38] And, uh, yeah, I know who you are.
[03:05:40] Hey, great, I said, you know,
[03:05:42] be great to get on camera.
[03:05:44] No, I won't cover you.
[03:05:47] You know, that's a crazy wild thing, too.
[03:05:49] You know, it never has that been done before.
[03:05:52] And, uh, pretty disappointing.
[03:05:56] You know, that's, yeah, that's another crazy disappointing
[03:05:58] thing is, uh, that, that slant on it is pretty tough.
[03:06:03] Well, that's a good way for people to keep their
[03:06:05] intellectual, media, uh, loop closed.
[03:06:10] Yeah. Yeah.
[03:06:11] Well, I'm just not going to put you on.
[03:06:12] Right.
[03:06:13] That's that.
[03:06:14] Not going to let anyone form their opinions about you
[03:06:15] because they're not going to know who you are.
[03:06:16] Craziness.
[03:06:17] Oh, yeah.
[03:06:18] Craziness.
[03:06:20] So, I mean, it seems like that gets us to present day.
[03:06:23] We caught up right now.
[03:06:24] Pretty caught up.
[03:06:25] Yeah.
[03:06:26] Yeah.
[03:06:27] We're, uh, running hard.
[03:06:28] We're, we're, uh, it's, uh, you know, I hit three, four
[03:06:31] events in a day, you know, I mean, I hit three events,
[03:06:34] four events before I had my debate the other day, you
[03:06:37] know, just because I got to get the name out there.
[03:06:39] And we're, you know, uh, we're everywhere all the time.
[03:06:42] Uh, you know, wife included, you know, a kid or two once
[03:06:45] in a while and, uh, just driving hard, you know, and
[03:06:49] seeing, uh, what, what comes up.
[03:06:52] And you're down to the wire right now, huh?
[03:06:54] Yeah. We're down to the wire.
[03:06:55] Uh, got another forum or debate on Wednesday as a
[03:06:58] forum, I guess, they haven't given us the format yet.
[03:07:01] Uh, so that's coming, you know, that there's a, uh, a
[03:07:05] third party candidate that just jumped in September 9th.
[03:07:08] Kind of can't figure that out yet.
[03:07:10] He's a right in candidate that activates rank choice voting.
[03:07:13] Um, so yeah, just vote Ed Thielander right across all
[03:07:18] three slots.
[03:07:19] Um, he's the love party.
[03:07:22] Love over violent empire.
[03:07:25] Well, I did say I love whales.
[03:07:26] Maybe I'm part of his thing.
[03:07:28] Yeah.
[03:07:29] It's rank choice.
[03:07:30] It's another crazy thing.
[03:07:32] What's rank choice?
[03:07:33] What do you, so you can put him in order of rank.
[03:07:35] Yeah.
[03:07:36] The top person gets three points or whatever.
[03:07:38] So if, if, uh, if I don't win by 51%, you know, over 50%,
[03:07:46] then it goes by rank choice.
[03:07:48] So, you know, you choose one, two, and three, or you can
[03:07:52] just do one across for, for one candidate and kind of your
[03:07:56] bad, well, it's, you know, uh, doesn't give any points to
[03:07:59] the other people.
[03:08:00] How are the polls right now?
[03:08:02] The polls, uh, you know, the legit poll we have, uh, is
[03:08:07] that we're out raising her three to one in main individual
[03:08:10] people, human donations.
[03:08:12] Okay.
[03:08:13] That's a good sign.
[03:08:14] The other ones is generic.
[03:08:15] Uh, and it doesn't really take an account me cause I'm, I'm
[03:08:19] still very unknown, even though we've been doing it for 14
[03:08:22] months.
[03:08:23] It's amazing.
[03:08:23] You know, there's, you know, uh, districts, you know,
[03:08:26] three quarters of a million people, main smaller being
[03:08:28] there's six, it's 680 plus thousand, you know, can't
[03:08:31] reach all those folks.
[03:08:33] So we're out there.
[03:08:34] We're, we're in the places that, that Republicans don't
[03:08:37] dare to tread cause, you know, they're coming on board.
[03:08:40] Um, you know, our first max donor was a far left Democrat
[03:08:43] and Democrats signing up, uh, um, to help us out.
[03:08:48] The don't, why do you think that is?
[03:08:50] Why do you think Democrats are signing up to help you out
[03:08:52] as a Republican?
[03:08:53] Cause people are tired of what's going on.
[03:08:55] Uh, they, they want to see change.
[03:08:57] There's, you know, tired and scared for the winter.
[03:08:59] You know, Maine is, uh, uh, we heat.
[03:09:03] The fuel prices is going to be crazy.
[03:09:04] Yeah.
[03:09:05] 60% of people in Maine heat with oil and it's over double,
[03:09:10] almost triple what it was, uh, last year, uh, and, and
[03:09:14] going up, you know, um, that's going to people are really
[03:09:18] going to choose between heat and heat.
[03:09:20] Um, and they were making that choice, uh, before, you know,
[03:09:24] uh, it's, it's going to be a very tough winter.
[03:09:27] Um, people don't want to be dependent on the government,
[03:09:30] but it's kind of being forced on them right now.
[03:09:32] And that's wrong.
[03:09:33] We want the Republicans, we want folks to be successful on
[03:09:37] the run.
[03:09:38] We help out, um, but man, it's, uh, it's opportunity and
[03:09:42] freedom, you know, uh, and responsibility and, uh, people
[03:09:46] want that.
[03:09:47] Maine is, you know, very independent.
[03:09:51] Uh, it's, uh, a ton of the voters, most of, uh, of large
[03:09:56] in the state are independent.
[03:09:57] Um, and, uh, they just want to be left alone and, and, uh,
[03:10:02] you know, nobody wants to pay taxes, but they do and, and,
[03:10:04] and they want to work.
[03:10:05] Yeah.
[03:10:06] I don't get people working again.
[03:10:07] It's what they want to, uh, a lot of things have been
[03:10:10] shut down and, and, uh, yeah, it's hard to find workers.
[03:10:13] You're experiencing that, you know, um, working on that.
[03:10:17] And some folks that, uh, been signing up for, uh, some training
[03:10:21] by Ashel on front and a couple of folks going to the
[03:10:23] musters, uh, as I'm, you know, going to the, uh, um, these
[03:10:27] job fairs, you know, talking to the, the, not only the
[03:10:31] students that they're going to some of these high school,
[03:10:33] uh, job fairs, but the employers too, you know, um, and I,
[03:10:38] I mentioned earlier, uh, uh, the camp was rolling, but, uh,
[03:10:42] yeah, the, uh, the Republican national committee, um, the
[03:10:46] executive director, uh, issues, uh, the field manual for
[03:10:53] discipline equals freedom to everybody that comes on board.
[03:10:56] Uh, pretty wild.
[03:10:57] Yeah.
[03:10:58] It's, uh, but yeah, people are tired.
[03:11:01] People are scared and, uh, you know, what's in power right now
[03:11:04] is influencing that, you know, whatever side you're on, uh,
[03:11:08] it's, uh, it's, it's time to make them change.
[03:11:11] If you want change, because you can't keep doing the same
[03:11:14] thing, things aren't going right.
[03:11:15] You got to vote it in and, uh, yeah, you know, uh, I do reach
[03:11:20] across the aisle, you know, and, uh, you know, I'm, you're,
[03:11:24] you're typical Republican, uh, conservative, you know, doesn't
[03:11:28] have purple hair.
[03:11:29] I talked to them, get ton of love off of everybody, you know,
[03:11:32] uh, tattoos up to the eyeballs.
[03:11:34] I don't, you know, I'm happy to talk to anybody, you know,
[03:11:37] um, you know, cannabis, you know, uh, folks, uh, medically,
[03:11:42] you know, so on board with it, recreationally, it's legal and
[03:11:45] main, let's tax it and move forward and, and, uh, protect
[03:11:49] the, the end, it's, it's, you know, those folks are still
[03:11:51] buying stuff, uh, and, uh, you know, Republicans aren't
[03:11:55] normally about that.
[03:11:56] Now I'm stepping on the over the line telling everybody
[03:11:59] right now I am, uh, and that's not, you know, the Republican
[03:12:03] standard.
[03:12:04] Uh, I'm willing to say, hey, you know, uh, yeah, I wasn't,
[03:12:09] I've never tried it, you know, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm not a
[03:12:12] heavy drinker, not never tried any of that.
[03:12:14] Uh, but medically, I know it's helped so many people.
[03:12:18] Um, and, uh, you know, prescribing an 11 year old
[03:12:22] Adderall, not a good plan.
[03:12:24] Uh, you know, there's other alternatives out there are not
[03:12:27] addictive that, that can keep them focusing straight.
[03:12:29] And, uh, we've got to be so much smarter about that.
[03:12:32] So you, so you have different viewpoints from the standard
[03:12:35] and you got an open mind thinking about what makes sense to
[03:12:37] you and not what the party line is.
[03:12:40] Yeah.
[03:12:41] Uh, it's, it's, that's very scary.
[03:12:43] Yeah.
[03:12:44] It's, it's the way I've lived my life.
[03:12:48] That's how I got where I'm at, you know, uh, that's how I've
[03:12:50] got along, you know, from, from childhood to now.
[03:12:54] And, uh, that's what America needs.
[03:12:56] I need somebody that's going to problem solve and get along
[03:12:58] and, and say, Hey, you know, um, I made a mistake there.
[03:13:02] Uh, let's move forward.
[03:13:04] You know, and, uh, can't, you can't not, you know, the
[03:13:08] Oodle-oop, you know, uh, for anybody want to explain that.
[03:13:13] Observe or orient yourself, decide and act.
[03:13:18] And then back to the beginning.
[03:13:19] Don't just keep moving forward.
[03:13:21] You know, small incremental decisions, you know, uh, and, uh,
[03:13:25] yeah, but if you don't admit you've even two to 2% or 100%
[03:13:31] got it wrong, uh, you're never going to improve and, you know,
[03:13:34] do what we did in the SEAL teams and make such an awesome machine.
[03:13:38] Our debriefs in the SEAL teams are brutal, brutal.
[03:13:42] Uh, and, uh, they don't do that.
[03:13:46] You know, uh, well, I'm going to do that.
[03:13:49] You know, uh, I'm concerned to be in my own party, you know,
[03:13:52] uh, uh, that I'm going to get along on a lot of things.
[03:13:56] We'll see, you know, um, you know, and everything I say, um,
[03:14:00] I'm willing to, yeah, check it out and see where, where it really is.
[03:14:04] Um, and I've tucked on subjects that, that, uh, in this podcast
[03:14:08] that, meh, you know, uh, people are going to say, you know, crazy wackadoodle dude.
[03:14:13] Hey, you know what?
[03:14:14] I'm still willing to look at it and, uh, make a decision, uh,
[03:14:18] maybe say I was wrong and, and move forward.
[03:14:21] Can't do it otherwise.
[03:14:23] Well, it's a refreshing attitude to hear.

[03:15:24] Gluten intolerance.
[03:15:25] And now I'm a keto kook and, uh, yeah.

[03:15:48] was when I went keto and that was, yeah, within a year and a half easy, uh, year.
[03:15:56] I mean, I just, it just came right off.
[03:15:58] And now you stay at 205.
[03:15:59] I can go down if I want to.
[03:16:01] Um, easy.
[03:16:02] Um, I just don't want to buy any more suits.
[03:16:10] Right on.

[03:16:46] Thank you for jumping into this mayhem that you're jumping into now.
[03:16:51] And, uh, I wish you luck in the political arena.
[03:16:53] I just, the fact that you can come on here and, and explain that you have
[03:16:57] different viewpoints than maybe one side or the other side and you agree with
[03:17:01] some and you agree, disagree with others.
[03:17:04] That's an open mind.
[03:17:05] And for me, I think that's what it's going to take to get our country moving
[03:17:08] in the right direction.
[03:17:09] So thanks for what you're doing, bro.
[03:17:11] And thanks for coming on.

[03:17:20] Echo Charles.
[03:17:22] Are you happy you're not running for political office right now?
[03:17:25] Yes.
[03:17:25] Currently, I am currently happy that I'm not currently running.
[03:17:27] You kind of had a look on your face during portions of that, um, recording
[03:17:32] that you were kind of happy that you weren't running for.
[03:17:36] Yeah, we were, um, talking beforehand and you know, you want, when you get
[03:17:40] into that arena, this is what I gathered.
[03:17:42] When you get into that arena, you see the curtain kind of gets pulled back
[03:17:45] and you see kind of how things work.
[03:17:47] And then you, so essentially you have a problem in there where it's like, Hey,
[03:17:50] we need to change this.
[03:17:51] How are we going to change that?
[03:17:52] Well, you know, this system is set up to allow this.
[03:17:55] Not necessarily for this, but it kind of allows for this.
[03:17:57] Well, okay.
[03:17:58] We'll change that then.
[03:18:00] Oh, well, but that system has to be voted on by the people who are benefiting
[03:18:03] from that system that allows this.
[03:18:06] And it's like, oh man, so okay, what do you got to do then?
[03:18:08] Then you got to do this.
[03:18:09] And you got to, and it's like this big, like unraveling of a thing with like
[03:18:15] so many unintended consequences.
[03:18:16] And it's like, man, it goes deep.
[03:18:19] And then that's, that's on top of like the obvious stuff.
[03:18:22] I was like, wow, man, I'm glad you're running and not
[03:18:24] me right now.
[03:18:27] Well, good on him.
[03:18:28] I'm glad we could get him out here.
[03:18:31] Because, you know, he's, he's making an effort.
[03:18:35] He's, and he's got a little, he's got like a pledge about taking ownership
[03:18:40] of what's going on, which is sort of, you know, taking ownership and actively
[03:18:44] participating in what's happening with the country.
[03:18:48] I can't make that claim.
[03:18:49] You know, I'm attacking it from a different angle, which for me, the angle
[03:18:54] is trying to bring manufacturing back to America, trying to grow businesses,
[03:18:59] trying to improve our economy through that methodology.
[03:19:02] But as far as jumping into the arena like him, you know, respect.
[03:19:06] So good on him.
[03:19:08] I wonder what, because you know, like taking responsibility for a mistake,
[03:19:11] it kind of seems real obvious from the outside, or maybe because just because
[03:19:14] you talk at all times.
[03:19:15] So now it's obvious to me, but I wonder if there's like some weird mechanism
[03:19:19] in the political world behind the crypto that kind of like doesn't allow for that.
[03:19:25] You know, like the obvious, not an obvious one, but the one that just hit me
[03:19:30] like right away was, let's say I say something dumb, or I say something about
[03:19:35] something or make a decision that's wrong or whatever.
[03:19:37] And I say, well, I'm not like, I made a, I made a mistake, you know, or whatever.
[03:19:41] Is it because everyone will attack them like in the media, you know, media outlets
[03:19:45] have different sides where they'll attack them.
[03:19:48] They'll attack them and then be like, Hey, uh, freaking Jocko.
[03:19:52] Finally, uh, admits he was wrong.
[03:19:55] No, no, no, they'll say it way worse than that.
[03:19:57] They'll say, finally confirms he's inadequate for this decision making
[03:20:02] type or something like this, you know, I think it may have something to do with.
[03:20:05] Do you remember at the monster that we just went to, there was a woman that asked
[03:20:10] it basically, you know, is it okay to say I'm sorry?
[03:20:13] Yeah.
[03:20:14] Yeah.
[03:20:14] I remember and you know, like, of course it's okay to say it.
[03:20:17] You know, when you make a mistake, you say, sorry, apologize for whatever mistake you made,
[03:20:20] but there's people like there's a whole leadership theory that you never apologize.
[03:20:27] Right.
[03:20:27] Yeah.
[03:20:27] I've heard that.
[03:20:28] And, you know, so I think the thing that we're talking about on the political side,
[03:20:33] I think there's something out there that's very similar.
[03:20:36] Never admit that you're right.
[03:20:37] Never admit that you're wrong.
[03:20:38] Right.
[03:20:39] Never apologize to, you know, the opponent and you know, to me, it's the same thing.
[03:20:45] You're just, if you make a mistake, apologize.
[03:20:50] Hey, this is a mistake.
[03:20:51] Here's what I thought was going to happen.
[03:20:52] Here's what actually happened.
[03:20:53] This is, I was wrong about this.
[03:20:55] Here's what I plan to adjust for next time.
[03:20:56] And I learned a good lesson that I can confirm will not happen again if I can prevent it at all.
[03:21:03] Yeah.
[03:21:04] So yeah, I think it's just that.
[03:21:07] I think it's just, and the other thing is nowadays, I mean, I guess it's not even that,
[03:21:12] just nowadays, what is it, Gerbil said that if you repeat a lie enough, it becomes the truth.
[03:21:17] And so I think a lot of people are just like, yeah, you know, I didn't say that.
[03:21:22] No, I did not say that.
[03:21:24] You know, you know, Chaco, it said, do you still confirm the what you said last week
[03:21:34] about the blah, blah, blah?
[03:21:36] And I go, I did not say that it was taken out of context.
[03:21:39] Right. But even though I did say it, you know, but you said, no, I didn't say that it was taken
[03:21:43] out of context. In fact, that reporter has been known to take things out.
[03:21:47] You know, you just go in there.
[03:21:48] In fact, my opponent has worked with that reporter in the past that that's why they
[03:21:52] asked that question because they're actually, you know, nefarious and their activities.
[03:21:57] So that's what everybody does.
[03:21:58] Everyone just denies, makes counter accusations, tells the lie enough time that it becomes the
[03:22:05] truth. And I think that's the standard operating procedure. And I think most people don't have
[03:22:12] time to pull the thread on it. I mean, some of the presidential debates last year were just
[03:22:18] ridiculous. Like they're just, they're just making accusations and then not even defending
[03:22:24] but just making a counter accusation and just, you know, you said that blah, blah, you said
[03:22:30] that the economy would do this. I never said that. You're like, what are you going to do?
[03:22:34] Go look up the quote? No. So it just becomes two people just shouting at each other.
[03:22:40] It's, it's horrible. The political thing is horrible right now.
[03:22:44] Props to these guys that are, these, these guys that are stepping up and doing something about it,
[03:22:48] good on you. And that's where Ed's at. So good luck, Ed. I think he's going to have a rough time.
[03:22:56] He's got, he's got, he's the problem is not a conformist. You know, he's not conforming to one
[03:23:01] side or the other side. He's got one view over here, but he's got another view. He's got one
[03:23:06] conservative view, one liberal view. Yeah. Do you think, because, you know, when you watch it on TV,
[03:23:11] that's like, so you know what happens? He gets shredded by both. That's what happens. Sorry for
[03:23:15] cutting you off. But only on, because I don't know. I don't know. I don't know everybody. Yeah. But
[03:23:20] it feels like, you know that I don't know. Yes. But I feel like when you're kind of like an honest
[03:23:28] person who's like, oh, wait, like, I know I'm supposed to think this because I'm in this party,
[03:23:33] but like, man, I'm still, I'm still kind of like pumping the brakes a little bit before I go hard
[03:23:37] on it because I want to find out more. And oh, I'm sorry. I made that mistake. And hey, this is
[03:23:41] what I'm going to do. Like this is how we're going to fix this mistake. You know, like, you would
[03:23:44] think that your everyday American person would be like, Hey, I think I like that guy. I think I,
[03:23:50] I think I'd really, I don't know him that much, but you're probably correct. And that the extreme
[03:23:55] people on either side were attack. Right. But it's the normal people like, dude, cut, cut him some
[03:24:00] slack. You know, he said something he didn't mean and he adjusted it. And then, but then they,
[03:24:05] at the same time they watch the news who's like kind of like, if you use the cliche word fear
[03:24:11] mongering, but it's like, they'll fear monger, you know, they'll be like, Hey, wait, this guy
[03:24:15] freaking is already making mistakes or something like that. You know, like they'll put it in your
[03:24:20] head that this guy is unreliable because he made a mistake and he even admitted the thing. Like,
[03:24:24] it's like, he flagrantly made him, you know, it's like that kind of stuff. And it's like,
[03:24:28] bro, you framed that as like this kind of scary bad thing. One really most of us kind of think
[03:24:33] that's good. If you did, if this media, whoever the news, whatever, if they didn't say shit,
[03:24:38] bro, we would have liked that guy. In fact, we wouldn't need that. We need that kind of attitude
[03:24:42] actually, you know. So it's like, man, we're all kind of getting washed up in the cyclone, you know.
[03:24:48] Yeah. At some point, someone's going to break through that has like a common sense attitude.
[03:24:53] That's what I felt too. I was like, Hey, you know, that's actually not true. No, I, you know,
[03:24:57] I said that, but I made a mistake. And here's what, here's, here's a more, here's a more
[03:25:02] a holistic look at that issue. So, and boom, you know, but, but again, if that, if the out,
[03:25:10] if the media outlet is against that person, they're only going to sound bite the negative thing.
[03:25:14] Yeah. That's not to mention, you know, how they say, and I don't know, because obviously I'm not
[03:25:18] in politics at all, but they do say, I've heard people are saying that if you go, let's say,
[03:25:25] you know, like, um, like Tulsi, you know, had this happen to where she'll go in the, I don't
[03:25:30] know, Democratic party, whatever, she'll go in and she'll start doing stuff that's like against,
[03:25:36] quote unquote, against the party, then they'll get drummed out by the party itself. Yeah.
[03:25:39] And if they're playing that freaking like kill them game or whatever, like they'll
[03:25:45] drama person out who's like being all honest and stuff. Yeah. Well, Tulsi's a great example.
[03:25:50] She got crucified. Bro. So it's like this hard ass game to like, to improve genuinely, you know?
[03:25:58] Holy cow. Freaking. I don't know. It feels like, I felt it though, like, I think you're right.
[03:26:04] I think like slowly by slowly, people are going to be like, wait, how about let's actually like do
[03:26:09] the right thing? Yeah. How about, like, let's just try it, you know, a little bit. You know,
[03:26:13] some people are crazy too. There's like crazy people. There's people that they're,
[03:26:19] their political beliefs are a religion and they're fanatical religious people, fanatical
[03:26:24] political people, which to me is, is if you're that focused, if you get emotionally upset
[03:26:31] about political things, then I think you should, you got issues, right? You know,
[03:26:38] you know what I'm saying? Yeah. It's people that get emotionally and look, I can understand,
[03:26:42] you know, you get mad about something or there's something that bothers you. Like,
[03:26:46] oh, that's, you know, that's, that shouldn't do it like that. Right? Yeah.
[03:26:50] But if I'm going crazy about it, yeah, like even you heard me talking about California,
[03:26:55] right? California has done so much dumb stuff in the last two years. And I'd be like,
[03:27:00] you are you kidding me right now? Yeah. But I didn't freak out. I didn't get on.
[03:27:05] That's another thing. If you're on social media and that's like a place where you're spending your
[03:27:10] time flipping out on flipping out on people. What was it? I think I was on that podcast with
[03:27:16] Chris Williamson and he asked me something about what was it? Like, how do you, you know,
[03:27:22] I think it was, it was basically either how do you handle negative comments or something like this?
[03:27:27] And I was like, bro, I mean, my recommendation is you don't spend a bunch of time being concerned
[03:27:33] about bots, brother bots. So I think when you're politically outraged about it, because, because
[03:27:42] here's the other thing you gotta remember. Okay. If you're a lobster man and you're about to have
[03:27:47] your, you're about to have your, your entire ability to provide for your family. I can understand
[03:27:54] getting outraged about that. I can understand being like, Oh, you know what? I'm going to protest
[03:27:59] because they're about to take my livelihood away from me. But there's a lot of things that people
[03:28:04] get emotional about that actually really aren't going to have an impact on their life. Yeah.
[03:28:08] No, no, yeah. Or it's like a hypothetical thing or whatever. Yeah. Also to like,
[03:28:14] and then I don't necessarily see people getting outraged about it, but, but being like really
[03:28:19] concerned about it, you know, on a personal level is the one that does make sense to me is like the
[03:28:25] taxes and stuff where like when you know you're going to get less of your paycheck, that makes
[03:28:30] sense to me. Yeah. You know, yeah. Well, if you want to make, if you want to get even more frustrated
[03:28:35] about that, once you realize that the government is taking a bunch of your money and then you see
[03:28:42] what they're doing with it and you, and you say to yourself, wait a second, right? Like, hey, if you
[03:28:47] were building awesome bridges, you know, and the streets were clean, like look at California,
[03:28:54] if you're like, Hey, you know what? I pay a lot of tax in California, but look, look at Main Street,
[03:28:59] you know, Los Angeles, this beautiful place, but you're not saying that you're literally,
[03:29:03] it's disgusting, right? It's disgusting. And then they do other crazy things. So you could start
[03:29:09] to get a little spun up about that, but you know what you do then you leave the state, which is
[03:29:12] what a lot of people have done. How many people are leaving California? Yeah. A lot. Yeah, that
[03:29:17] should be an indicator. And you could look at the federal taxes the same way. You're like, Hey,
[03:29:22] look, I want to pay for the security law, pay for the military, right? Hey, that's cool to pay for
[03:29:25] some infrastructure. I'm good with that. But then when you start pulling the thread on those things,
[03:29:31] we should do a podcast where we just read through some of those expenditures. Oh, it's insane.
[03:29:37] It's totally insane what the government spends money on. You can't make it up. If I tried to
[03:29:43] make up things right now for dumb stuff for the government to spend money on, I couldn't come
[03:29:47] close to the dumb stuff that they actually spend on government spends money on the dumbest things.
[03:29:54] And yet what are you going to do? Well, you do your best to vote for people that want to tax
[03:30:02] less and that want to have a smaller government because big, the bigger the government doesn't
[03:30:09] become more efficient, doesn't solve more problems. Like when you're going to, when you're doing an
[03:30:14] operation, you're going to have this conversation with life life was like kind of in the learning
[03:30:19] mode and you're taking down buildings and you think, Hey, I was put everyone in the building.
[03:30:26] But you can put so many people in the building that they're kind of in the way. Now you got to
[03:30:30] like hire someone you got to advance or promote someone to be in charge of the other group while
[03:30:34] they're in the building. And that means those two people got to communicate. So you got to put
[03:30:37] someone in charge. You see what I'm saying? All of a sudden you got a bureaucracy in a in a in a
[03:30:40] kill house. We don't want that. That's like the big government problem. You know, a big assault
[03:30:47] force, look, you need an assault force. You have enough people to handle the rooms and handle security
[03:30:51] cool. I get it. But you can't just double that and say, Okay, now it's going to be more efficient.
[03:30:57] It might not be more efficient. And if you triple it, you may have some real issues. Now, now you
[03:31:03] have a problem. And now the problem is the assault force itself. You have a chance of creating a
[03:31:09] blue on blue because there's so many freaking assaulters going in. So the same thing happens
[03:31:13] with the government. I mean, here's they just what this bill coming where there's 87,000 more
[03:31:20] IRS agents. I think it doubles the size of the IRS. That's too many assaulters in the room.
[03:31:28] You should have saved like there's too many. Hey, if the tax code, they don't even know really
[03:31:33] what the tax code is, you know, I hire someone, I can't figure out what my taxes are. I can't even
[03:31:40] come close to figure out what my taxes are. I have to hire someone who's got multiple people
[03:31:45] working for him that goes through and figures all that out. Because that's how complicated it is.
[03:31:51] So I have to pay someone who also pays other people to figure out what I need to pay the government.
[03:31:58] It makes sense that if the government is going to bill me for something, they just give me a bill
[03:32:02] and I pay it. You know, I don't go into a restaurant or dinner and I say, hey, you know, how much do
[03:32:11] I owe you? And they say, well, figure it out. Yeah, here's a scale. You better weigh that rice.
[03:32:17] Yeah, here's the cost of rice right now. And by the way, if you don't come up with the right number,
[03:32:23] we're going to have you arrested when you leave the restaurant because you didn't pay the money
[03:32:28] that you owed us. Well, I don't know how much I owe you. Well, you better figure it out. That's
[03:32:33] crazy. What if you overpay the government like your taxes and you like, let's say you overpaid your
[03:32:39] taxes and it rolls forward. It rolls forward. Do they do that automatically though? Or do you
[03:32:44] have to like say, hey, I overpaid and then they do it? I'm not sure, but I know that my accountant,
[03:32:51] shout out Brandon, good to go. Freakin awesome guy. Sometimes he tells, he sends me a list like,
[03:32:57] this is what you overpaid and how this has got rolled up. But I don't know if he didn't do that,
[03:33:00] would they just be taking that money? Probably. I wonder, yeah. So that would kind of make it
[03:33:07] like officially unfair. Bro, it's officially unfair as it is. Right? I think it's officially
[03:33:15] unfair as it is. You are going to charge me. You want me to pay you money, but you won't tell me
[03:33:20] how much because I got to figure that out. And if I get it wrong, you're going to come arrest me.
[03:33:23] How's that work? How did you know I was wrong? Well, why don't you just tell me what that number
[03:33:28] was? Right? I got to pay this other dude and his team to figure out how much money I owe you.
[03:33:36] And if I don't pay you the correct amount, you're going to arrest me, but you won't tell me what
[03:33:39] that number was. That's a crazy talk. You wouldn't think that that made any sense whatsoever. And
[03:33:43] yet that's how it works. And now we got to hire 87,000 more people. 87,000. By the way, when you
[03:33:50] hire 87,000 people at the government, would you get government federal jobs like that? That's a
[03:33:56] lifetime of pay. That's retirement pay. That's health insurance for the rest of all these people's
[03:34:02] lives. It's health insurance for their families. It's a crazy deal. It's not like you hired a
[03:34:09] small number of people and they're going to do some extra work. And when they're done with that
[03:34:12] extra work, they're going to move on and find another job. No, you're hiring someone for their
[03:34:17] life. That's what a federal job is. So these aren't like small budgetary additions. These are
[03:34:26] a total change, a paradigm shift in the size of this tax collecting organization.
[03:34:35] And that's the best you can do. Everything is digital now. And the best you can do is hire 87,000
[03:34:39] more people to help us figure this out. Are you kidding me right now? So you want to talk about
[03:34:44] stuff that can get you crazy? That's one of them. But nonetheless, I'm talking about it right now
[03:34:51] with you. I've never talked about this with you. And I know when I go home, I'm not going to be
[03:34:55] like fuming about it, right? Yeah. There's issues that people get spun up about. And by the way,
[03:35:01] what I just talked about, that's a pretty serious issue. They're taking money that you worked for,
[03:35:06] they're taking it from you and they're spending on things that don't make any sense.
[03:35:08] That's that if there's one thing that could piss you off, that's definitely in the top seven. I
[03:35:14] agree. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I mean, would you be mad if I went in, got into your
[03:35:19] car, took your wallet out, took your money and left? Would you be mad? What if I only took 50%
[03:35:23] of your money? Would you be mad? I would be mad. Yes. And but what if I bought you dinner
[03:35:28] with your money? But I also kind of bought me dinner too. So, so people taking your money
[03:35:35] is definitely one of the top things that can be annoying to you and can piss you off. The government
[03:35:39] does that all the time. So, if there's, but that's the top seven, definitely the top seven of things
[03:35:46] that can piss you off, people stealing from you. Hey, look, it's own, it's not stealing up to a
[03:35:52] certain point. Because when I, when the government takes money and they spend it on things that,
[03:35:58] you know, help, hey, okay, we're going to have a good military, we're going to have good infrastructure,
[03:36:02] we're going to have some reserve, you know, fuel in case something goes, hey, I'm in support of
[03:36:08] those things. Cool. I got it. But that hits a limit. The government doesn't need 51% of my money to
[03:36:14] do that. Doesn't. But they're taking it. They're spending on some other shit. Some, some shit that
[03:36:22] I don't, you know, that is not right. So that's where we end up. Yeah. Anyways, you guys are
[03:36:29] talking about the Oak Horse, how you can't just go in there anymore. You think you could do the
[03:36:34] Oak Horse right now? Yeah, 100%. Would you get a good, what do you guys time it? Or something like
[03:36:40] this? Yeah, no, it's definitely timed. No, I probably wouldn't get a great score because there's
[03:36:44] some technique that I'd be rusty on. Is there a minimum you got to make or something? Can you fail
[03:36:48] the Oak Horse? You can definitely fail the Oak Horse. Okay. Would you fail the Oak Horse? No, I would
[03:36:52] pass it. You'd pass it. Would I pass it? I would need to teach it to you for two days and then you'd
[03:36:57] pass it. Oh, no shit. Yeah. If you're, if you're athletic, like, you, if you can do pull-ups,
[03:37:03] push-ups, dips, and you can run, you're going to be okay. It's, it's a, I'll tell you what, that
[03:37:07] Oak Horse is awesome. When you get done with that thing, you're smoked. Oh, it's hard. So like, oh,
[03:37:11] yeah. Solid. How long does it take? Give it roughly. Seven minutes. Oh, damn. Seven minutes of putting
[03:37:18] out. Seven minutes of putting out hard. Like, you know, uh, you know, the, the taste in your mouth,
[03:37:26] you know what I'm saying? Like the, the, the, I just put out real hard. What is it? Like a
[03:37:32] copper taste in your mouth? You know what I'm saying? You get that 100%. Oh, for real. Even if
[03:37:36] you're kind of chilling, like, let's say, let's say you and I went out there weekend, you know,
[03:37:39] we're in the teams and we're just go out there. We're still going to feel it a little bit. But
[03:37:44] when you go hard because you're trying to pass because you're in buds, but I always liked the
[03:37:50] expression putting out. Yeah. I don't think I ever heard that telling you guys or whatever.
[03:37:57] Check. Cool. Well, speaking of putting out, you got it. You got a fuel. Yes. The output. Yes. I'm
[03:38:03] not going to, going to recommend you do that with some clean fuel. The cleanest fuel,
[03:38:08] jockel fuel. It's true. Physical, mental, integrity. Like these are all important things. So when you
[03:38:16] fuel that, you fuel your integrity. How'd you throw that one in there? I got physical, I got mental,
[03:38:20] tossed integrity. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:38:24] You got a kid and they're not the kids lying in school. We give them some jockel fuel, but
[03:38:28] tighten up the integrity. Yeah. It tells the truth. It's true. No, when you're putting out is what
[03:38:33] I'm saying. I'm going to make a new supplement called integrity. Maybe you should. Let's do it.
[03:38:38] All right. There you go. Book it. Put on the books or whatever the expression is you guys use.
[03:38:42] Anyway, yes. When you fuel that output, when you're putting out all that stuff, you want the
[03:38:49] supplements with integrity. You want integrity, me and supplements, that's something. Okay. Energy,
[03:38:54] for example, energy drink. I'm explaining to you like, you don't know, even though I do know that
[03:38:58] you do know energy drink usually has sugarcane, uh, uh, preservatives, you know, poison. Right.
[03:39:07] Jockel fuel does not have that. Clean, only healthy stuff, clean stuff. Yeah. Integrity. That's what
[03:39:11] I mean. Exactly what I'm talking about. Same thing with the malt protein shakes, protein mix,
[03:39:16] and RTD, no sugar. Sweetened with fruit, not even like, uh, sucrose or fruit, toaster,
[03:39:24] actual monk fruit. Monk fruit. So good. So good. Uh, yeah. So check that actually on the way down,
[03:39:30] you heard Keto. What, what, how did Ed describe himself? Keto. Keto. Kuk. Keto kuk. I said, hey,
[03:39:38] man, you want one of these drinks? He goes, I can't, it's a, I'm, I'm a Keto kuk. And I was like,
[03:39:42] we're good. Good to go. He said, there's no sugar in there. I said, no, there's no sugar.
[03:39:46] It's sweetened with monk fruit. And he's like, I'll go crack one open. Keto kuk. Keto kuk.
[03:39:51] Getting after Keto kuk approved. Yep. Actually says, what does it say? It says something on the
[03:39:55] can about Keto. Keto friendly, maybe? Anyways. So there you go. Get yourself some Jockel fuel,
[03:40:04] Jockel fuel.com. Go to Wawa. Go clear the shelves at Wawa. That's what you got to do.
[03:40:09] Clear the shelves at Wawa. Just go, go in there and buy them all. That'll, that will help the

[03:40:35] like it's, it's, it's kind of what do you call it when it's safe, you know? Or so you can't go
[03:40:42] wrong. You can't go wrong with that one. Oh, well, that's how you feel. A lot of people feel,
[03:40:45] a lot of people feel that's the one. That's the top of the list. That's because you like that mango.
[03:40:49] Mango is the one by far, my opinion, but I'm with it. I'm with the whole gig.
