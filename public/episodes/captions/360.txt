[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 360 with Dave Burke and me,
[00:00:04] Jocko Willink.
[00:00:05] Good evening, Dave.
[00:00:06] Good evening.
[00:00:08] The secretary of the Navy takes pleasure
[00:00:11] in presenting the Navy Commandation Medal
[00:00:13] to Lieutenant Thomas Coppell for services set forth
[00:00:17] in the following citation.
[00:00:19] For heroic achievement as a pilot of jet aircraft
[00:00:23] while attached to fighter squadron 142,
[00:00:27] embarked in USS Constellation.
[00:00:30] On 14 January, 1970,
[00:00:33] Lieutenant Coppell flew the wing aircraft
[00:00:35] of a two-plane attack mission in Southeast Asia.
[00:00:38] Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire in the area,
[00:00:41] he placed all of his bombs on target,
[00:00:44] resulting in five enemy trucks destroyed
[00:00:46] and many secondary explosions and many enemy casualties.
[00:00:52] His professional determination in spite of
[00:00:54] heavy anti-aircraft fire and adverse weather conditions
[00:00:57] resulted in a substantial damage
[00:01:00] to the enemy's logistics efforts.
[00:01:03] Lieutenant Coppell's superb airmanship, courage,
[00:01:06] and devotion to duty reflected great credit upon himself
[00:01:10] and weren't keeping with the highest traditions
[00:01:13] of the United States Naval Service.
[00:01:16] The combat distinguishing device is authorized
[00:01:20] for the secretary M.F. Weisner,
[00:01:24] Vice Admiral, United States Navy.
[00:01:29] And that is a citation that represents
[00:01:33] the types of missions that were flown
[00:01:35] by Navy fighters day after day,
[00:01:38] night after night, week after week, month after month,
[00:01:42] year after year.
[00:01:44] Those were the type of missions
[00:01:45] that resulted in solid battle damage to the enemy,
[00:01:54] but also resulted in 532 aircraft lost in combat.
[00:02:00] 401 aviators killed, 64 missing, 179 captured,
[00:02:08] who became prisoners of war.
[00:02:11] 75 of those aircraft that were shot down
[00:02:14] were F-4 Phanoms.
[00:02:19] These missions were flown by pilots
[00:02:21] who took incredible risks to get the job done
[00:02:24] and eventually pilots that rewrote the book
[00:02:27] on air to air combat and laid the foundation
[00:02:30] for how fighter pilots are trained to this very day.
[00:02:34] And it's an honor to have one of these pilots
[00:02:36] here with us tonight, that pilot in fact,
[00:02:40] is from the opening award citation, Tom Copel.
[00:02:45] Tom, thanks for coming down.
[00:02:47] Appreciate you coming out here.
[00:02:48] Anyone know we got Dave?
[00:02:51] He used to keep me honest.
[00:02:54] Well, he's always excited.
[00:02:57] The few times I've had some pilots on
[00:02:59] without having Dave on, he's not happy about it.
[00:03:03] So we got him here and I guess let's just kind of
[00:03:08] start from the beginning and how you grew up
[00:03:10] and where you came from.
[00:03:11] So you were born in Queens, is that right?
[00:03:15] Yeah, Jamaica Hospital, huge hospital in Queens,
[00:03:19] but we lived just over the city line in a new development
[00:03:23] that the house was built and my parents moved in
[00:03:27] with a brand new baby.
[00:03:29] And this was 19 what?
[00:03:31] 41.
[00:03:32] So you're pre-war.
[00:03:33] Yeah, and my dad was not drafted because of me.
[00:03:37] He was an insurance underwriter in the financial district
[00:03:42] of insurance district of downtown, downtown Manhattan,
[00:03:48] Nassau Street and those places down there.
[00:03:51] How much?
[00:03:52] And a nice guy, I have to say.
[00:03:54] Well, that's good.
[00:03:54] How much, so you're born in 1941,
[00:04:00] I'm assuming before the war started, before Pearl Harbor?
[00:04:04] I was, yeah, August and Pearl Harbor was in December.
[00:04:07] Okay.
[00:04:08] Yeah.
[00:04:09] So as you're growing up, is there any part of World War II
[00:04:12] that you remember?
[00:04:14] I remember my mother telling me that the war in Japan
[00:04:16] was over, I don't remember her telling me
[00:04:18] that the war in Europe was over.
[00:04:23] On the other hand, since I was four years old
[00:04:26] and I had a brand new sister, they sort of left me alone
[00:04:30] and I would go down to the corner, believe it or not.
[00:04:33] What was then, I guess it probably still is
[00:04:35] Hillside Avenue and I used to see low-boy trucks
[00:04:38] with grown, I assume they were F-6 fighters
[00:04:46] with the wings removed.
[00:04:47] They put the fuselage and the wings on the side.
[00:04:51] I think the engines and propellers were on them
[00:04:54] but obviously they were on their way to South Pacific.
[00:04:57] And ask your mother, what the heck is that?
[00:04:59] And she would say, oh, they're going to war
[00:05:02] and stuff like that.
[00:05:03] So I assume that was 1944.
[00:05:08] I was three years old, sitting on a curb
[00:05:10] and that's the first I remember of any of that
[00:05:13] but they told me that both Grumman and Republic
[00:05:15] were out in the island at that time,
[00:05:18] I guess it was farms.
[00:05:21] Did that leave an impression on you seeing the fighters?
[00:05:24] I mean, first of all, I don't remember anything
[00:05:26] until I was about 17, I think.
[00:05:27] So you remember in 7.3 is pretty impressive.
[00:05:30] But did you think, oh, these are war planes going to war?
[00:05:35] Did that make any sense to you?
[00:05:36] Oh yes, oh yes.
[00:05:38] But I never expected that I would be a guy
[00:05:40] that would fly them or anything like that.
[00:05:44] And the other thing I remember about flying machines
[00:05:47] was not combat or war or anything like that.
[00:05:51] It was the fact that Idlewild that became JFK
[00:05:55] when they expanded it and the airport
[00:05:58] was seeing the DC7Bs coming in from Europe.
[00:06:05] In bad weather, they used the east-west runway
[00:06:08] and streaming fire out of the back of the,
[00:06:12] off the top of the wings and how the heck is that?
[00:06:15] So I finally, in my grown-up days,
[00:06:18] talked to a guy who was a retired naval aviator,
[00:06:21] P3's, so he sent me.
[00:06:24] I said, Dennis, why didn't you want to be a carrier guy?
[00:06:29] Many engines, Tom.
[00:06:30] Oh, sorry about that.
[00:06:32] But at any rate, he was a flight engineer on DC7Bs
[00:06:37] and he said that's because a flight engineer
[00:06:39] goes full rich and flames roaring out the back
[00:06:44] and especially in foggy weather when they were, you know.
[00:06:48] Oh, so that's what you'd be saying.
[00:06:49] Yeah, I wanted to do that.
[00:06:51] That's really hot stuff, you know.
[00:06:53] But, and well, and jumping ahead, I guess,
[00:06:58] but why do I want to go with,
[00:07:01] I wanted, my father said, I graduated from college.
[00:07:04] My dad said, what are you gonna do?
[00:07:05] And I said, I don't know.
[00:07:07] He said, why don't you see one of the services
[00:07:09] will teach you how to fly?
[00:07:10] I said, don't take guys like me.
[00:07:12] He said, they sure do.
[00:07:13] Well, before you get to college, what was growing up like?
[00:07:17] So did you grow up there just outside the city?
[00:07:19] Yeah, and I was just a kid.
[00:07:23] A four-year-old kid down on the corner
[00:07:27] at Hillside Avenue by yourself, which is cool.
[00:07:30] Yeah, but that was a different time, I think,
[00:07:33] or something like, maybe there were as many monsters
[00:07:35] around then as there are now,
[00:07:37] but nobody talked about or acted that way.
[00:07:40] And as soon as I got a bike, you know, it was.
[00:07:43] Then it was really on.
[00:07:44] Yeah.
[00:07:45] I was never there.
[00:07:47] Were you, how'd you do in school?
[00:07:49] Did you like school?
[00:07:49] Terrible.
[00:07:50] I hated school.
[00:07:51] I hated school.
[00:07:53] I was a, my wife loves to tease me
[00:07:56] that I was such a terrible little monster
[00:07:58] that one of the classrooms that I was in in grade school
[00:08:03] had a, it was at the two classrooms
[00:08:06] at the end of the hallway.
[00:08:07] And then a connecting room between the two.
[00:08:09] She put me in the connecting room with a door that opened
[00:08:12] so I could see the blackboard.
[00:08:14] But I was in the room with the door open
[00:08:16] about 10 inches wide.
[00:08:18] And you were just a hyperactive kid?
[00:08:21] I think so.
[00:08:22] And the board with all of that, I could read before.
[00:08:25] I was, I could read when I was four.
[00:08:28] So my, we're always buying me books.
[00:08:31] So stuff like that.
[00:08:34] So you were a smart little board.
[00:08:36] I guess.
[00:08:37] I don't know.
[00:08:38] What about sports?
[00:08:38] Were you into sports at all?
[00:08:40] Yeah.
[00:08:41] Cause I was the biggest kid and played,
[00:08:46] touched football in high school, which got,
[00:08:48] I'm sorry, in grade school, seventh and eighth grade,
[00:08:51] and it gets a little rough.
[00:08:52] At least it did then.
[00:08:54] So, but I never got hurt or anything like that.
[00:08:57] And then when I got to high school,
[00:08:58] I played, played football and played first team.
[00:09:03] What year did you graduate high school?
[00:09:05] 59.
[00:09:07] So you grew up in like the iconic fifties.
[00:09:09] That's right.
[00:09:10] That's right.
[00:09:11] When you see those movies, are you just?
[00:09:13] I think it's awful.
[00:09:14] Why is it awful?
[00:09:15] The clothes that they wear and the nostalgia, the cars,
[00:09:19] we realize I do today are death traps.
[00:09:24] But they bring huge money, these cars and the fifties.
[00:09:27] Which one did you have?
[00:09:28] You must have had one.
[00:09:29] Did you have one?
[00:09:29] I guess maybe not in the city.
[00:09:31] No, it's not the city.
[00:09:33] It was real suburbs.
[00:09:34] Wooden houses on little bitty, little bitty lots.
[00:09:39] So did you have a car?
[00:09:41] No.
[00:09:42] You know what?
[00:09:43] I never owned a car until I was in flying school
[00:09:47] in Big Spring, Texas.
[00:09:51] Never had a need of one.
[00:09:53] Got around.
[00:09:54] Back in the fifties, early sixties,
[00:09:58] you stick out your thumb, you got a ride.
[00:10:01] People were different then, somehow or other.
[00:10:04] I don't really understand how that is.
[00:10:07] But I went all of the eastern half of the United States
[00:10:10] with my thumb.
[00:10:11] I went everywhere.
[00:10:13] And never worried about getting back or anything like that.
[00:10:17] But on one time, the worst time I ever had doing that
[00:10:20] was on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Western Pennsylvania.
[00:10:23] I was there for 12 hours.
[00:10:27] What?
[00:10:28] No one would pick me up.
[00:10:29] I have no idea why.
[00:10:30] And maybe I'd look scowly or something.
[00:10:33] I don't know.
[00:10:35] I don't think I would have been a great hitchhiker
[00:10:37] if it comes down to looking scowly.
[00:10:39] How we definitely have some issues.
[00:10:41] So you're growing up in the iconic fifties.
[00:10:43] How do those movies miss the mark, hit the mark?
[00:10:47] I mean, how are they?
[00:10:48] The fifties movies.
[00:10:50] Yeah.
[00:10:51] I don't know.
[00:10:52] Frankly, I don't remember.
[00:10:55] I don't remember what movies you might be talking about.
[00:10:58] What about Elvis?
[00:11:00] You remember?
[00:11:01] I thought it was awful.
[00:11:02] You thought Elvis was awful.
[00:11:03] I personally did.
[00:11:04] I guess my sisters thought otherwise.
[00:11:06] Three younger sisters.
[00:11:08] But I thought that was the dumbest thing I ever heard of.
[00:11:12] So that's what I thought.
[00:11:13] So what were you listening to?
[00:11:16] I have to admit, classical music.
[00:11:18] My minor story.
[00:11:23] My wife, when, before we were married,
[00:11:28] somehow or other I introduced her to the fact
[00:11:31] that I listened mostly to classical music.
[00:11:34] And she went home.
[00:11:35] She tells me now.
[00:11:37] Actually, after we were married,
[00:11:40] said this guy is a little bit weird.
[00:11:42] Suspect for sure.
[00:11:43] This is the classical music.
[00:11:45] I don't know.
[00:11:48] Rimsky-Korsakov-Sherzad that everybody knows.
[00:11:53] I was really intrigued by that.
[00:11:56] So I listened to classical music and still do it today.
[00:11:59] Whatever.
[00:12:00] So the rock and roll thing was not your scene?
[00:12:02] Not until the California, the British invasion
[00:12:06] and California.
[00:12:07] And that was all together different.
[00:12:09] Okay, we'll get there.
[00:12:10] So you graduate from high school, 1959.
[00:12:14] So you lived through the Korean War as well?
[00:12:16] I remember it well.
[00:12:18] I remember being in Boy Scout camp
[00:12:20] when they announced the armistice
[00:12:24] had just been signed that morning or whenever it was.
[00:12:30] That was a big deal.
[00:12:31] Everybody sheared.
[00:12:32] But you still didn't get the impression
[00:12:35] that that was something that you might do one day?
[00:12:36] No, no.
[00:12:37] There was no military tradition in the family at all,
[00:12:41] except for a grand uncle, Maximum Nice Guy,
[00:12:47] who was a graduate of the same college
[00:12:52] as Donald Trump graduated, still exists
[00:12:55] at New York State Military Academy, I think it's called.
[00:13:00] But he graduated in 1936 or something like that.
[00:13:04] And he was part of the last combat cavalry regiment
[00:13:10] in the United States Army.
[00:13:13] And I was disbanded, I think in 1939,
[00:13:17] as the storm clouds were gathering
[00:13:19] and they disbanded that unit.
[00:13:21] But that was officers with real swords
[00:13:25] and two horses each and all the rest
[00:13:28] of everything else about that.
[00:13:30] But that was a combat unit, not a display unit.
[00:13:34] And it was the last one.
[00:13:36] He wound up in Iceland for the duration of the war,
[00:13:39] deriding the whole experience.
[00:13:42] But I only realized in my grown-up days
[00:13:45] that if Hitler had won the Battle of Britain,
[00:13:49] Iceland was next.
[00:13:51] And they probably, no doubt knew that,
[00:13:54] but they all, I went to a reunion with him at one point
[00:13:59] and they all derided their experience there and so forth.
[00:14:02] But they would have been the first to be killed
[00:14:04] and the first super German raid on Iceland
[00:14:10] to flatten the place.
[00:14:11] Yeah, we used to get a similar thing in the SEAL teams
[00:14:14] where you'd get some platoons would be going over
[00:14:16] to Iraq or Afghanistan.
[00:14:19] And some other platoons would be going to like Guam
[00:14:23] or somewhere where there's no war going on.
[00:14:25] And of course, all the guys that are,
[00:14:27] get sent to Guam are just angry
[00:14:30] that they can't be in Iraq or Afghanistan.
[00:14:32] And meanwhile, the guys in Iraq or Afghanistan
[00:14:34] are freezing or sweating to death
[00:14:37] or to get shot at or whatever.
[00:14:38] Yeah, they use real bullets here and stuff like that.
[00:14:41] But that's what, you know,
[00:14:42] that's what people join the SEAL teams for.
[00:14:44] Yeah.
[00:14:45] And apparently the horse cavalry as well.
[00:14:48] Yeah, it was for real.
[00:14:50] Swords and the whole deal with those guys.
[00:14:53] And he was a wonderful man, wonderful man.
[00:14:57] When sisters were born, I got farmed out with him twice
[00:15:01] in the summertime.
[00:15:02] And he worked in Lower New York State Binghamton
[00:15:09] and Elmira, those places around there.
[00:15:11] And he had grand aunts who had a truncated farm there.
[00:15:16] And he farmed me out with them.
[00:15:20] You're just slave labor.
[00:15:21] And I had fun.
[00:15:22] I had kid fun being a kid with cornfields and ponds
[00:15:27] and stuff like that all over the place there.
[00:15:31] And then where'd you end up?
[00:15:32] So where'd you end up going to college?
[00:15:34] I went to Albright College in Reading, PA.
[00:15:39] Commuter for me.
[00:15:41] Very small college at that time,
[00:15:43] 850 students at that time.
[00:15:45] And now it's about 12 or 1300,
[00:15:48] maybe a little bit more than that.
[00:15:51] But wonderful teachers there.
[00:15:54] Absolutely wonderful.
[00:15:55] Especially the man, but one notable woman
[00:15:58] who was a pacifist of all things.
[00:16:01] But she was absolutely a wonderful woman.
[00:16:04] And...
[00:16:05] How come she left such a big impression on you?
[00:16:08] Because she was so straight.
[00:16:10] I'd never met a woman quite like that.
[00:16:12] She was straightforward and thoughtful and aggressive.
[00:16:18] I like a woman who is my wife.
[00:16:21] She tells you what's on her mind immediately.
[00:16:27] And she was that way, I guess.
[00:16:29] And she was a professor there?
[00:16:30] Yeah, she was.
[00:16:31] What was she teaching?
[00:16:32] English, English and speech.
[00:16:34] And she changed with her professional abilities and so forth.
[00:16:43] And I remember sitting there arguing with her silently.
[00:16:48] No, a ten minute lecture about using the atomic bomb
[00:16:54] in Japan, she was opposed to that.
[00:16:56] And I don't think she had read notably or widely enough
[00:17:03] about all that.
[00:17:05] And I had at that point, as opposed to that.
[00:17:09] But still, I thought she was really great.
[00:17:14] Point of view sort of thing.
[00:17:16] What were you studying?
[00:17:18] I was an econ major, not business, economics
[00:17:24] and minor in history.
[00:17:27] And had some fabulous teachers there.
[00:17:32] A guy named Wilbur Gingrich who was a genuinely world famous
[00:17:39] Greek scholar and biblical scholar.
[00:17:43] A couple of other guys that nobody ever heard of,
[00:17:46] but a wonderful man.
[00:17:48] And a crazy guy who loved to teach European
[00:17:56] and Russian history.
[00:17:58] And I took him for Russian.
[00:17:59] Don't take him for God's sakes.
[00:18:01] You've got a D out of that.
[00:18:04] And he'll blither you and you can't write fast enough.
[00:18:07] And his class, his name was,
[00:18:10] Gingrich was the biblical scholar, a Greek scholar.
[00:18:18] Can you believe it?
[00:18:19] His name escapes me.
[00:18:20] But at any rate, Kistler.
[00:18:22] And they said, you'll get a D out of his class
[00:18:26] because you can't write fast enough and stuff like that.
[00:18:29] But he was something, he smoked continuously.
[00:18:35] And always had the window open and the butts went out
[00:18:37] of the window and he'd torch up another one.
[00:18:40] But he was really something.
[00:18:43] What'd you get in the class?
[00:18:44] B, all of six in the class.
[00:18:47] So at some point you got more into school than you were
[00:18:52] when you were in grammar school or whatever.
[00:18:54] Yeah, no, because I had smart people
[00:18:56] who were just smarter than I was.
[00:18:58] And how'd you put it?
[00:19:02] My parents weren't really educated, if you will.
[00:19:04] My mother had a college degree from NYU,
[00:19:07] but I think she skated as much as she could.
[00:19:10] And my dad, they kicked him out of grade school,
[00:19:13] yeah, out of school when he was after 10th grade,
[00:19:18] I think, because he was done.
[00:19:21] They did that at that time in the 20s.
[00:19:24] So both of them wanted me to be educated.
[00:19:28] And so it was interesting to be in the company
[00:19:32] of genuinely educated people.
[00:19:34] And I didn't catch fire at first
[00:19:36] by the time I was a junior.
[00:19:38] I understood that this is really an experience.
[00:19:42] You can get interesting things out of these people.
[00:19:48] By the time I was a senior, I didn't want to leave.
[00:19:51] Because you get to talk as a grown-up
[00:19:54] with these grown-ups who listen to you
[00:19:56] and then tell you things you had never conceived of before
[00:20:00] and stuff like that.
[00:20:01] So I had a good time in college until they kicked me out.
[00:20:06] At what point did you start looking at the military
[00:20:08] as a legitimate option for you?
[00:20:12] Not until I was about to graduate.
[00:20:15] And back in the good old days, my dad worked.
[00:20:19] He was a New Yorker, New Yorker, New Yorker,
[00:20:22] but he got a job in Redding, Pennsylvania.
[00:20:25] And it was a shock to all of us.
[00:20:27] I didn't want to leave the school I was in.
[00:20:28] I was going to Progles.
[00:20:31] So this is back in high school?
[00:20:32] Yeah.
[00:20:34] I was two years into Chamonaut High School in Long Island,
[00:20:37] which is by entrance exams and tuition.
[00:20:41] And I liked it there.
[00:20:43] I was doing a little bit better, a little bit better.
[00:20:45] But I didn't want to leave.
[00:20:47] And he came home and said he'd been offered a job
[00:20:50] in Redding, Pennsylvania.
[00:20:51] Where is that?
[00:20:54] We were New Yorkers, New Yorkers.
[00:20:58] I can do the accent, too.
[00:20:59] And of course, when you get to Pennsylvania,
[00:21:01] the kids make endless fun of you because of your accent
[00:21:05] and stuff.
[00:21:06] But at any rate, where was I in this?
[00:21:09] We're just trying to figure out, at what point did you
[00:21:12] think the military might be an option?
[00:21:13] I could go downtown Redding and go up the fire tower staircase
[00:21:20] and plop in the chair in my dad's office.
[00:21:24] And he said, so what are you going to do?
[00:21:25] You're going to graduate here.
[00:21:27] I said, I don't know.
[00:21:29] He said, have you considered maybe the government would
[00:21:34] teach you how to fly in one of the services?
[00:21:36] And I, they don't take guys like me.
[00:21:38] He said, they surely do.
[00:21:40] 2020s and good shape, nothing wrong with it.
[00:21:46] So I applied to the Navy guy.
[00:21:48] And he was an embarrassment.
[00:21:53] Overweight, feet up on the desk, didn't seem to care about
[00:21:59] anything.
[00:21:59] I filled out all his paperwork.
[00:22:01] And he never got back to me.
[00:22:03] Went to the Air Force guy.
[00:22:04] And he was close to his quota, probably.
[00:22:09] He drove me around.
[00:22:11] You have to go here and fill out these.
[00:22:13] I'll help you fill out the form.
[00:22:16] And the Air Force took me.
[00:22:17] So, but the, when was the question?
[00:22:25] Well, that was the question.
[00:22:26] The question was, how did you first get the idea of how to
[00:22:29] fly?
[00:22:29] My dad said, see if you learn how to fly.
[00:22:31] And he didn't know how to fly.
[00:22:33] So did they have like a contract that made you a pilot?
[00:22:35] Was that part of the enlistment process?
[00:22:39] They only said, we like everything you do.
[00:22:43] Now you have to fill out a preference sheet.
[00:22:49] And you can put whatever you like in there.
[00:22:51] We suggest this list of stuff over here.
[00:22:55] And then you make them one, two, and three choices.
[00:23:00] I said, well, I want to be a pilot.
[00:23:03] Because that's what I'm doing this whole thing for.
[00:23:07] He said, well, most people put in navigator for second and
[00:23:09] then something like, I don't know, auxiliary
[00:23:13] aviation or something like that.
[00:23:15] I said, well, that's not why I'm here.
[00:23:17] So I put pilot, pilot, pilot, one, two, three.
[00:23:20] Funny thing too, the B-52 squadron I was later in, was a
[00:23:24] guy from my college class.
[00:23:26] And I said, Danny, what are you doing here as a navigator?
[00:23:30] He said, well, they told me, put pilot first, navigator
[00:23:33] second.
[00:23:34] I said, you don't wear glasses or anything.
[00:23:37] He said, well, that's what they took me as.
[00:23:40] I said, well, I didn't want to rub it in.
[00:23:42] So I just let it alone.
[00:23:45] So what was your indoctrination to the Air Force then?
[00:23:48] I went to their OCS in San Antonio.
[00:23:53] It's not at Lackland.
[00:23:57] I think they called it the Medina base.
[00:23:59] It's nearby.
[00:24:01] And I went through that.
[00:24:02] That's three months.
[00:24:04] Was it a shock to your system?
[00:24:06] Were you wondering why the hell you did this?
[00:24:08] Well, I was fortunate.
[00:24:09] There were several previous enlisted guys there.
[00:24:15] And I thought, they know the ropes.
[00:24:17] Do whatever they do.
[00:24:19] So that's what I did.
[00:24:22] And then they said, if you play a musical instrument, put
[00:24:26] your name on this list.
[00:24:27] And I said, no, no.
[00:24:28] Guy told me, don't volunteer for anything.
[00:24:31] Before I went in.
[00:24:33] So I found out the guy was running this thing.
[00:24:38] He loves to have live music for any parades that he has.
[00:24:42] And if you can play a musical, get your name on it.
[00:24:44] I did.
[00:24:45] So there were.
[00:24:46] What instrument did you play?
[00:24:47] I played the trumpet and cornet.
[00:24:50] I played baritone.
[00:24:51] I can play alto, or French horn, or any of those.
[00:24:55] But I dropped that for a long time in midlife.
[00:24:58] I'm back into it now.
[00:25:00] Anyway, you got out of everything.
[00:25:04] You straightened up your digs and your bed and whatnot.
[00:25:09] And when the Saturday morning inspection happened,
[00:25:14] we had rehearsal.
[00:25:16] And that was they, if you will, all knew that.
[00:25:21] So this is, what, 1963?
[00:25:23] No, no, 65.
[00:25:26] January 65.
[00:25:27] Because, see, I graduated in August
[00:25:31] because I was having too much fun by that point in college.
[00:25:37] You ought to take that professor's history course.
[00:25:39] He's really interesting.
[00:25:41] And you should take compared to the economic systems,
[00:25:44] because you should do that.
[00:25:45] And I didn't have enough credits.
[00:25:47] I had two.
[00:25:49] If you needed 150, I had 175.
[00:25:53] But you don't have enough in your major or in your minor.
[00:25:56] You took that course and you got good grading.
[00:26:00] And you're right.
[00:26:00] So I wound up graduating in August.
[00:26:03] But how did you get into that?
[00:26:06] So it's 1965.
[00:26:07] So you're starting to hear about Vietnam.
[00:26:09] You guys must be talking about Vietnam.
[00:26:11] No, no.
[00:26:12] Because that happened in January of 1965.
[00:26:21] And summer of 64, I worked through college
[00:26:25] at a small summer stock playhouse
[00:26:28] because I was in the drama club in college.
[00:26:31] And you meet this guy and meet that guy and so forth.
[00:26:35] And all very legitimate, if you will, good people,
[00:26:39] not these sorts of flaky dumb people
[00:26:42] that you might think of when you think of theater sort of people.
[00:26:49] And I had a mentor by this point.
[00:26:50] A guy from New York was old enough to be my father.
[00:26:54] And he said, when you graduate, where are you going to do?
[00:26:58] And I said, well, I don't know.
[00:27:00] This paperwork and the Air Force to Fly and stuff.
[00:27:06] And he said, they were looking for a guy like you
[00:27:10] at a theater in Baltimore that I am going to, he said.
[00:27:14] Should I mention you to them?
[00:27:15] And I said, well, OK.
[00:27:18] So he called me in about a week or so.
[00:27:21] And he said, they want 15 minutes of drama
[00:27:24] and 15 minutes of comedy if you can do that.
[00:27:28] They want to talk to you.
[00:27:31] So I went to a woman in the summer stock company, Grace
[00:27:36] Chapman, wonderful woman.
[00:27:37] And I said, can you help me?
[00:27:39] And she did.
[00:27:40] I said, I want to do it like this.
[00:27:41] And she said, no, no, no.
[00:27:42] We're going to do it this way and so forth.
[00:27:46] So rehearsed it with her.
[00:27:48] Have to memorize everything, of course.
[00:27:51] Did all that and went down to Baltimore, stood up on the stage.
[00:27:56] Lights.
[00:27:58] And they've got what?
[00:27:58] A few people are watching you to judge you?
[00:28:01] The two bosses sitting in the city.
[00:28:03] And they're thinking of giving you some kind of a role?
[00:28:06] No, they had a program there where you actually
[00:28:09] worked as a, in the union deal, the actors union.
[00:28:16] It's called Actors Equity.
[00:28:17] You work as a local jobber and it's called.
[00:28:21] Doing what?
[00:28:22] What's your job?
[00:28:23] Well, they've got you.
[00:28:26] They've got you by the short hairs, as they say.
[00:28:29] And you will get role.
[00:28:34] Maybe the minor, maybe you were just a walk on for this one.
[00:28:37] And maybe something serious.
[00:28:39] I got one very nice role out of it.
[00:28:42] I was the elder son in Galileo by Bertolt Brecht.
[00:28:48] He was a notable European communist.
[00:28:53] But a good director there for that, John Marley, the guy who,
[00:28:59] a lot of people, he was a workhorse, a Hollywood movie actor.
[00:29:07] He was the guy in bed with a horse during the first Godfather
[00:29:12] film.
[00:29:13] That was John Marley and a nice man as well.
[00:29:16] Anyway.
[00:29:18] So wait, so this was in the summertime you were doing this?
[00:29:20] Summer stock in a barn, believe it or not, in Pennsylvania.
[00:29:24] And then Jerry Richards was a New York guy, old enough to be my dad,
[00:29:29] said he was going to this equity company in Baltimore,
[00:29:34] relatively new, called Center Stage.
[00:29:37] It's still active today.
[00:29:39] And was I interested, did you have another thing in mind?
[00:29:42] And I went back and I said to my mother,
[00:29:44] been passing, I was thinking about this.
[00:29:47] She said, do what you have to do, all right?
[00:29:50] So I hitchhiked once again.
[00:29:54] To Baltimore.
[00:29:55] To Baltimore.
[00:29:56] And how long did you stay in Baltimore for?
[00:29:58] Only until I got a big fat envelope in the mail from DoD.
[00:30:04] And it said, we will teach you to fly if you want to.
[00:30:08] And of course, the draft was there.
[00:30:10] And I had already called the draft board and I said,
[00:30:13] where am I?
[00:30:14] And they said, we can't tell you by the law.
[00:30:17] But I'll tell you this, you're close to the front of the drawer.
[00:30:21] I remember that very well.
[00:30:23] I thought, I've got to do something about this.
[00:30:25] I wonder what to do about this.
[00:30:27] And I went to a fellow guy who was in the same position
[00:30:31] I was in the company.
[00:30:33] And I said, I don't know what to do.
[00:30:35] And he said, do what I did.
[00:30:37] Tell them you like boys, not girls.
[00:30:41] I said, that's not true.
[00:30:43] He said, it's not true with me either.
[00:30:45] But it got me right.
[00:30:46] They could go sit on the bench over there.
[00:30:48] And they asked, do you really like boys rather than girls?
[00:30:52] And he said, I just said, that's right.
[00:30:54] I do.
[00:30:55] And that was the end of that.
[00:30:57] And I got off.
[00:30:57] I said, oh, boy.
[00:30:59] That may be good advice some ways.
[00:31:01] But I thought somewhere down the road,
[00:31:03] somebody's going to drag that out 40 years from now.
[00:31:07] And so I didn't want to do that.
[00:31:09] And lo and behold, I get this big fat envelope in my mouth.
[00:31:11] I go to Jerry Richards, my mentor.
[00:31:15] I said, what should I do?
[00:31:15] He said, he was a combat veteran of World War II.
[00:31:20] A dog-faced soldier had funny stories
[00:31:23] to tell about being on a line of March, hot, sweaty,
[00:31:28] and an Italian farmer going by with a wooden tank
[00:31:33] on a little wagon pulled by a horse.
[00:31:37] And the second lieutenant, whoever it was,
[00:31:41] said, stay away from that tank.
[00:31:43] We all knew it was full of wine or grape juice anyway.
[00:31:49] And he said, we got two thirds of the line through there.
[00:31:52] And somebody went, boom, boom, boom.
[00:31:54] And that was it.
[00:31:56] Everything collapsed.
[00:31:57] Anyway, super nice guy.
[00:32:00] And I went to Jerry.
[00:32:01] And I said, what should I do about this?
[00:32:03] And he said, well, you always come back to this,
[00:32:06] but you're never getting another chance to do that.
[00:32:08] So I signed on the dotted line.
[00:32:11] And I went into the Air Force on the 2nd of January, 1975.
[00:32:18] 1965.
[00:32:19] 65.
[00:32:21] Yeah, 65.
[00:32:22] He said, 75.
[00:32:23] That's right.
[00:32:24] 65.
[00:32:24] So yeah, so that early part of Vietnam.
[00:32:26] Because I always think in a way the news kind of worked.
[00:32:30] It was the battle of the I-Dreng Valley in 1965
[00:32:33] where it really hit the news.
[00:32:34] And there was casualties.
[00:32:36] And it seemed like the escalation really kind of started.
[00:32:40] So you get done with the Officer Candidate School.
[00:32:45] And then you get your slot to flight school?
[00:32:47] Right.
[00:32:48] And that was at Webb Air Force Base in West Texas,
[00:32:52] at Big Spring, Texas.
[00:32:56] Pretty much of a barren place, just east of the big, big oil
[00:33:01] fields.
[00:33:02] But there were plenty of oil wells around where I was,
[00:33:05] around Big Spring.
[00:33:06] But the big oil fields around Midland and Odessa, Texas.
[00:33:13] Permium Basin, it's called.
[00:33:17] And there had been at least one crash at Big Spring, Texas.
[00:33:22] They made a very big deal out of it, and rightly so.
[00:33:24] The guy was confused about stars and oil fields.
[00:33:28] Every drilling, not their drilling rig,
[00:33:32] but every pumping deal has its own light bulb on it.
[00:33:36] And he got confused and rolled over.
[00:33:38] To your shame.
[00:33:39] Yeah, so really ashamed.
[00:33:41] But I learned to fly there and then went to the.
[00:33:45] How was flight school?
[00:33:49] It was tough for me at first because I didn't know a wing
[00:33:53] from a tail, an aileron from an elevator, anything.
[00:33:58] And about half those guys had private licenses.
[00:34:02] At least half of them had private licenses.
[00:34:06] And a couple of them had commercial multi-engines.
[00:34:10] They weren't just walking through the thing.
[00:34:13] But I was slow to get going.
[00:34:15] But when I got into the second half, which was the T-38
[00:34:19] at that time, I did very well.
[00:34:22] But it's like a baseball player trying to bring his average
[00:34:29] up the second half of the season.
[00:34:31] So your grade point average was a problem for me.
[00:34:35] And I wound up getting a B-52 assignment.
[00:34:41] My roommates got C-130s, which was a very desirable deal.
[00:34:45] If you didn't want to get shot at,
[00:34:46] it turned out to be very foolish.
[00:34:50] Because in C-130, you got shot at in the Vietnam War.
[00:34:55] And one of my roommates got Air Defense Command F-104,
[00:35:02] which was considered to be creme de la creme,
[00:35:05] until I got assigned to the F-4.
[00:35:10] But first, you had to do your B-52 time.
[00:35:12] Right.
[00:35:12] The G-Model in Rome, New York, wonderful place,
[00:35:15] wonderful people there.
[00:35:17] I liked everything about it except sitting alert.
[00:35:20] Awful.
[00:35:21] So this is now what, 1966 or so?
[00:35:25] Yeah, that's right.
[00:35:26] And you're assigned to the B-52 squadron in Rome, New York.
[00:35:31] Yeah.
[00:35:32] Very heavily decorated squadron from World War II.
[00:35:35] I can't remember the number, 488 or something like that.
[00:35:40] Eighth Air Force.
[00:35:43] I had the first guy they put me with was a guy of shorter stature.
[00:35:49] And I think he had a problem about that.
[00:35:52] And I was six feet tall and whatnot.
[00:35:54] And all the way down to him saying, I said, that's not so.
[00:35:58] He said, it is so.
[00:35:59] And you shut up because I'm a major.
[00:36:01] And you're just a goddamn first lieutenant.
[00:36:04] Whoa, OK.
[00:36:06] But at any rate, he fired me, so to speak, basically.
[00:36:09] He didn't want to fly with me anymore
[00:36:12] because I may have made better landings than he did.
[00:36:16] Because the next guy I got was a family man.
[00:36:18] And we got along like brothers.
[00:36:20] And it was great.
[00:36:21] So the one lead pilot or whatever it was called,
[00:36:24] the lead pilot, the major?
[00:36:25] Yeah.
[00:36:26] He didn't like flying with you.
[00:36:28] Right.
[00:36:29] Well, he didn't like your attitude or something.
[00:36:30] And he didn't like my attitude either.
[00:36:32] So he got rid of you.
[00:36:33] Right.
[00:36:33] But then you just moved to another guy?
[00:36:35] Yeah.
[00:36:35] Well, they gave me another guy.
[00:36:38] You don't have any choice about it.
[00:36:39] But we got along.
[00:36:42] Had fun every day.
[00:36:43] And what's the deal with sitting alert?
[00:36:46] Well, they did it two different ways.
[00:36:51] At Romney Arc, where I was, they had eight airplanes
[00:36:55] on alert at any one time.
[00:36:58] All the airplanes that I was on had two Hound dogs stand off
[00:37:03] missiles with thermonuclear weapons in them.
[00:37:08] The Mark 28 at that time.
[00:37:10] I don't think it's classified anymore.
[00:37:13] But the highest yield on those, single warhead per.
[00:37:20] And there was a pop on there.
[00:37:24] And then four thermonuclear weapons in the Bombay.
[00:37:28] And then four Quail decoy missiles in the Bombay.
[00:37:34] And the targets for the ones I was on, well, I was on a
[00:37:41] mission that was downtown Moscow, believe it or not, and
[00:37:45] land in Turkey.
[00:37:46] I think all of the ones I was on were land in Turkey.
[00:37:49] Because you were out of fuel.
[00:37:50] By then you were fueled south of Iceland.
[00:37:54] And then went in and then turned straight south and landed
[00:38:01] on an abandoned airfield in central Turkey.
[00:38:06] And you were instructed to get fuel by Jerry Can.
[00:38:11] This is silly.
[00:38:12] And we knew it.
[00:38:16] Jerry Can was not enough.
[00:38:18] He had eight J57s and a B52.
[00:38:21] And H model had modified J57s that were fan jet engines.
[00:38:27] But it was silly.
[00:38:28] You'd never forget enough fuel to refuel the thing, to fly
[00:38:33] it anywhere.
[00:38:34] So I mean, was that just because once you flew over Moscow
[00:38:37] and dropped nuclear weapons, it wouldn't really matter where
[00:38:40] you were getting?
[00:38:40] What was the?
[00:38:41] Pretty much.
[00:38:41] Because you're assuming that the world would be a conflagration
[00:38:45] and would be pretty much of a mess.
[00:38:48] But at that point, you would truly a thermonuclear war
[00:38:52] would have finished by that time, I guess.
[00:38:56] And everything would be an awful, awful mess.
[00:39:00] And are you sitting, like are the weapons loaded on the aircraft?
[00:39:05] Just sit there, stage?
[00:39:05] Absolutely.
[00:39:06] Positively with an armed guard on every airplane.
[00:39:10] Walking around underneath every airplane 24 hours a day.
[00:39:14] Was there any events that would heighten your readiness?
[00:39:18] They would have practice alerts that could happen at any time.
[00:39:28] SAC, World Strategic Air Command, worldwide,
[00:39:32] would call an alert.
[00:39:34] And every SAC base on the planet, even in obscure places,
[00:39:39] would do what they were told to do.
[00:39:44] And they basically had three commands.
[00:39:48] One, to man the airplanes and start them at stay in place.
[00:39:53] Second, start the airplanes and taxi down the runway,
[00:39:58] just motivate the flying machines.
[00:40:02] And third would be a real launch.
[00:40:04] Actually, there were two kinds of launches,
[00:40:06] launch to a holding point short of total commitment.
[00:40:13] Or four, total commitment from minute one.
[00:40:18] So obviously, the third and fourth never happened with me.
[00:40:27] The alert was at Rome New York, at Griffiths Air Force Base
[00:40:31] of Orange, is where I was.
[00:40:32] And wonderful people there, too, was seven days.
[00:40:36] You had seven days on.
[00:40:38] And the rules were half your time on alert.
[00:40:41] You had three.
[00:40:43] But it didn't really work out that way,
[00:40:46] because you didn't get away from the base until, in this case,
[00:40:51] Thursday, 12 o'clock or something like that.
[00:40:55] And you lost half the day.
[00:40:57] And then they would schedule you for a flight, maybe,
[00:41:03] Monday night at 8 PM.
[00:41:07] So Monday was sort of gone, because you had to sleep,
[00:41:11] because you were going to fly for 12 hours.
[00:41:14] You took off at 8 PM, you were going to land at 8 o'clock
[00:41:17] Tuesday morning.
[00:41:18] All those missions, those training missions, were eight hours.
[00:41:23] But training missions were sort of fun and interesting.
[00:41:27] I spent a lot of time with my hands in my lap.
[00:41:29] But nevertheless, they were interesting.
[00:41:33] And you went all over the United States,
[00:41:35] all over the United States doing those things.
[00:41:38] And a lot of them were at low level,
[00:41:40] because that's what you would do in the case of a nuclear war.
[00:41:44] Oh, it's a low-level attack?
[00:41:46] Oh, yes.
[00:41:47] The B-52s were all assigned a low altitude.
[00:41:54] Like how low?
[00:41:55] 200 feet.
[00:41:57] That's good, underneath radar?
[00:41:59] Right.
[00:42:00] Yeah.
[00:42:01] As low as you want to go is what I was told.
[00:42:04] I said, this is a poker deck route,
[00:42:07] and it's published at 400 feet.
[00:42:09] How low are we talking about here if we actually do have a war?
[00:42:14] As low as you want to go.
[00:42:17] I said, one point, you have charts that were accurate,
[00:42:22] accurate, and classified, obviously.
[00:42:26] But I said to one of the guys who worked in the vault,
[00:42:31] you had to target study while you were on alert.
[00:42:34] And I said, you show telephone poles here.
[00:42:38] Here I am to co-pilot, looking for the next turn.
[00:42:43] Can I count those telephone poles?
[00:42:45] Yes, you can.
[00:42:46] Whoa, they were all done by U2 or by satellite.
[00:42:50] I think the satellites were just starting at that time.
[00:42:54] So I said, so it would be the 28th telephone pole.
[00:42:59] I can turn left to 030.
[00:43:03] Yep.
[00:43:04] Anyway, so what was the question?
[00:43:08] Where would the heck we're going?
[00:43:09] Well, it's very interesting to hear
[00:43:12] sort of what your status was as a pilot.
[00:43:16] And I actually asked you what level of alert, what's
[00:43:19] the highest level of alert you are?
[00:43:21] Because obviously, you missed the Cuban missile crisis.
[00:43:23] That's right.
[00:43:24] Because I'm sure that would have been a very high alert.
[00:43:27] Right.
[00:43:28] Do you think they got airborne for that?
[00:43:29] I don't think so.
[00:43:30] I don't think so.
[00:43:31] I don't remember ever asking anybody.
[00:43:34] But I don't think that that happened.
[00:43:37] No.
[00:43:37] And that had to be a little bit of a strange weight
[00:43:43] on your shoulders to think about, especially
[00:43:46] with your background, with your English teacher that
[00:43:48] didn't like the atomic bombs dropped on Japan.
[00:43:51] Right.
[00:43:52] And here you are with a mission tasking
[00:43:54] that if you get this mission, you're
[00:43:56] going to fly and annihilate basically the world.
[00:44:01] Well, I have a little bit of a funny story about it.
[00:44:03] Let's hear about that.
[00:44:05] Turns into a funny story.
[00:44:06] I like that.
[00:44:07] In the G and the H, we had the gunner up front.
[00:44:10] And the guns that were in the tail.
[00:44:12] So these are the G and H models of the B-52.
[00:44:15] Right.
[00:44:16] Up to that, the gunner rode in the tail.
[00:44:18] And if he were to bail out, he would
[00:44:21] jettison his turret, which weighed something like 2,000
[00:44:25] pounds, everything.
[00:44:26] His ammunition and his 50 calibers and everything short
[00:44:32] of the seat.
[00:44:33] He sat on a chemical toilet back there, incidentally.
[00:44:36] But then he would bail out.
[00:44:38] He did not have an ejection seat.
[00:44:41] It was right in front of his toes.
[00:44:42] And he just stepped forward or leaned forward now
[00:44:45] to win with a conventional parachute.
[00:44:48] Anyway, the gunner and the G and the H models up front.
[00:44:54] And the cockpit arrangement is different in the G and the H
[00:44:58] than it was in the earlier, up to the F model, B-52.
[00:45:04] The G's no longer exist.
[00:45:05] They went with the strategic arms limitation treaty.
[00:45:10] And the G's got their pictures of them getting their wings
[00:45:14] cut off that they took airborne pictures of all that.
[00:45:18] So comply with the Russians.
[00:45:21] The Soviets?
[00:45:22] Yeah.
[00:45:23] But at any rate.
[00:45:24] The G and the H internally are the same.
[00:45:26] And the ECM officer and the gunner ride facing backwards.
[00:45:33] And now it was going to.
[00:45:37] Oh, yeah.
[00:45:37] So on your charts, when you do your first day of alert target
[00:45:43] study, it's the same charts every time.
[00:45:47] The gunners, you sit across the table.
[00:45:49] And I said, oh, you have LPBN.
[00:45:55] That means something.
[00:45:56] And E35, that means something across the route of flight.
[00:46:03] And I said, LPBO.
[00:46:06] In the same lettering, stencil, same ink, same everything.
[00:46:12] I said, what's LPBO?
[00:46:14] He said, last point of bailout.
[00:46:18] That's over Finland.
[00:46:20] He said, exactly right.
[00:46:21] I'm not going to anybody's nuclear war.
[00:46:23] I'm leaving.
[00:46:24] I'm over Finland.
[00:46:25] I'm taking the seat pack with me with the.22 rifle,
[00:46:29] the sleeping bag, and everything.
[00:46:31] I'm out of here.
[00:46:34] But it never happened.
[00:46:36] He was an E6 enlisted guy.
[00:46:40] And nice family man and everything else.
[00:46:42] But he said, I'm not going to nuclear war.
[00:46:44] You're nuts.
[00:46:46] So how long did you do this job for?
[00:46:48] A year.
[00:46:49] Well, including the RAG, if you will, in Merced, California,
[00:46:55] a year and a half.
[00:46:56] But then I got the big fat envelope that said,
[00:47:00] here is your interservice transfer.
[00:47:03] If you want to do this, you can do this.
[00:47:05] And that's what you had applied for?
[00:47:06] Right.
[00:47:07] And why did you try and do an interservice transfer
[00:47:10] to the Navy?
[00:47:11] Because I didn't want two sides to that.
[00:47:13] And there's popping your peas again there.
[00:47:17] I didn't want to sit alert anymore.
[00:47:20] I didn't like riding around with my hands in my lap.
[00:47:26] And going way back, I had this idea in the back of my head.
[00:47:31] My first cross country in the T-37 out of Web Air Force Base,
[00:47:36] we stopped somewhere I can't remember.
[00:47:39] And there were two Navy guys there wearing golf shirts
[00:47:43] underneath their flight suits.
[00:47:47] And through the open door, there were two A4s parked out there.
[00:47:51] And they said something like USS Independence or USS,
[00:47:56] who knows, Forest Hall or who knows what.
[00:47:58] I thought, isn't that hot stuff?
[00:48:01] These guys can go to sea with those things and go,
[00:48:05] I don't know, anywhere they want.
[00:48:08] That's hot.
[00:48:09] And then I saw the back of a proceedings magazine.
[00:48:15] Proceedings used to be magazine size.
[00:48:17] Then it became smaller format.
[00:48:21] But it showed an A4 looking over the A4's shoulder,
[00:48:26] like the wingman or something like that.
[00:48:27] Looking over it.
[00:48:28] And he's on short final for our carrier.
[00:48:30] And I thought, that's hot shit.
[00:48:34] So that did it.
[00:48:35] And was it hard to put in that interservice transfer?
[00:48:38] It was pretty straightforward.
[00:48:39] Well, they bounced it back at me.
[00:48:41] So no, the carrier format's wrong.
[00:48:43] It has to be this way and that way.
[00:48:45] I have to do that.
[00:48:46] And I said, fine.
[00:48:48] Well, what do you want us to do?
[00:48:49] I said, well, you tell me it's wrong.
[00:48:51] I did it according to what was in the Publications Library.
[00:48:56] You do it.
[00:48:57] I said, well, I guess we have to.
[00:48:59] And they did.
[00:49:01] Then I signed everything the second time and then the way it went.
[00:49:04] And you got straight into the pilot pipeline?
[00:49:07] Well, no, I was, you know, when you're a military officer,
[00:49:12] you are an officer of the United States.
[00:49:15] You're not an Air Force officer or a Navy officer
[00:49:19] or even an officer of the, there's a land survey
[00:49:24] and mapping service.
[00:49:27] They have military uniforms.
[00:49:29] You are an officer of the United States.
[00:49:33] So it isn't like you change services.
[00:49:37] You change uniforms and you change terminology
[00:49:40] and you change verbiage.
[00:49:43] And the name of your grade changes from first lieutenant
[00:49:49] to lieutenant junior grade.
[00:49:50] But they can put you anywhere they want.
[00:49:55] You can be a seal who's a lieutenant commander
[00:49:58] and they can say, guess what?
[00:50:00] We want you in the embassy in Tunisia
[00:50:04] and it's only going to be six months.
[00:50:06] But you'll be wearing civilian clothes
[00:50:08] and you'll be responsible for us and so on, us and so on.
[00:50:11] And that can do that.
[00:50:12] Because remember, you're appointed by the President
[00:50:15] of the United States.
[00:50:18] You're going to serve in that capacity.
[00:50:21] So that's what happens with an inner service transfer.
[00:50:23] And I was told that when you make the transfer,
[00:50:28] it's basically a long table meeting of senior service
[00:50:36] and I have a doc who wants to come over to the Air Force
[00:50:40] and you have a junior lieutenant who wants to go Navy.
[00:50:45] I'll swap you for those two.
[00:50:47] OK, that's fine.
[00:50:47] Let me do that and so forth and so forth.
[00:50:50] And that's the way it's done.
[00:50:51] But every six months or something like that
[00:50:53] and it probably goes on right now.
[00:50:55] I don't know.
[00:50:56] But you ended up with the pilot slot somehow.
[00:51:00] Yeah, well, I had orders to King's, Corpus Christi.
[00:51:05] And I'm standing in a guy's office, nice guy,
[00:51:09] with the Lieutenant Commander,
[00:51:13] a few of the parking ramp with S-2's,
[00:51:15] Stu's parked behind him, pissed an engine,
[00:51:19] had a submarine airplanes.
[00:51:20] It's a training facility for them.
[00:51:23] And a couple of Lieutenant Commander standing over here
[00:51:26] and me standing right here in front of his desk.
[00:51:30] And he said, what are we going to do with you?
[00:51:31] I said, I don't know.
[00:51:33] I just have these orders.
[00:51:35] He said, you flew jets?
[00:51:36] I said, yeah?
[00:51:38] He said, well, then we'll send you to Kingsville.
[00:51:40] What should we do with him?
[00:51:42] What happens if he can't get aboard?
[00:51:44] I thought, I will get aboard.
[00:51:48] So what's Kingsville?
[00:51:50] Kingsville are two advanced training bases.
[00:51:53] I think there is B-ville still active?
[00:51:55] B-ville's close to Kingsville.
[00:51:57] Yeah, and Kingsville is bigger than ever.
[00:51:59] And Navy advanced.
[00:52:01] At that time, there were F-9s there.
[00:52:04] And I went over to Kingsville and introduced myself
[00:52:07] and dropped my orders on the table, and so to speak.
[00:52:09] And all very nice.
[00:52:11] And looked out the window, and they
[00:52:13] had these ancient airplanes, F-9s, Creme War vintage.
[00:52:18] Oh, boy.
[00:52:20] What ancient equipment here.
[00:52:24] There was more fun to fly than you can imagine.
[00:52:27] You put the power up all the way and leave it there.
[00:52:30] And it was like your brother's MG with a little four-cylinder
[00:52:35] engine in it was so much fun to drive, underpowered.
[00:52:38] Same way.
[00:52:39] Fun, fun, fun to fly.
[00:52:41] It was truly a flying airplane with a wing, airfoil wing,
[00:52:49] and everything else.
[00:52:50] You fly, get into the phantom, and you find, no,
[00:52:52] this is a machine.
[00:52:54] Now, at this point, you're hearing about Vietnam.
[00:52:57] Vietnam's now is 19, what, 1967?
[00:53:00] Yeah.
[00:53:00] So now you know what?
[00:53:03] You're in a pipeline.
[00:53:04] Your goal is to be a fighter pilot.
[00:53:05] You know that that pipeline ends up in Vietnam.
[00:53:08] Yeah.
[00:53:09] So your detailer calls you on a whole phone in the BOQ.
[00:53:14] And I think I was a lieutenant by this point.
[00:53:17] Maybe not.
[00:53:18] Senior lieutenant junior grade anyway.
[00:53:20] I had two rooms and a private bath.
[00:53:24] And you were in Kingsville in those?
[00:53:28] I was.
[00:53:28] Big, solid BOQs there.
[00:53:30] Very nice.
[00:53:32] But when you took a shower, the water was so bad,
[00:53:37] the ground water.
[00:53:39] It smelled like ancient sauerkraut.
[00:53:41] Remember that?
[00:53:43] It was awful.
[00:53:44] At any rate, we were OK.
[00:53:47] So at what point do you get assigned to go to the RAG for F-4?
[00:53:51] Well, your detailer calls you on a whole phone of all things.
[00:53:54] And put Tom Copell on.
[00:53:56] He's in room B-7.
[00:53:59] God comes in.
[00:53:59] Hey, Tommy, you got a phone call.
[00:54:02] It's my detailer again.
[00:54:04] He said, Tom, we really want you in the A-6.
[00:54:06] That's just for you.
[00:54:08] Same as the B-52.
[00:54:09] You have experience with offsets and everything else.
[00:54:12] It's going to be perfect.
[00:54:14] I said, I don't want that, Bob.
[00:54:15] You know that.
[00:54:17] Call me back next.
[00:54:20] A series of phone calls.
[00:54:22] The last one was the same thing.
[00:54:25] Tom, you're perfect for the A-6.
[00:54:27] By now, you probably looked around, talked around about it.
[00:54:30] That's a heck of an airplane.
[00:54:32] Yeah, I know, Bob.
[00:54:33] I still want F-4.
[00:54:36] OK.
[00:54:37] Let me think about it.
[00:54:39] And about a week later, a guy called me and said,
[00:54:42] you have orders up there at Admin.
[00:54:44] Big spring at that time.
[00:54:45] I'm sorry.
[00:54:46] Kingsville at that time was nowhere land.
[00:54:49] And I did not have a car.
[00:54:52] I said, it's up at the other end of the main drag,
[00:54:56] the parallel hangar area.
[00:55:02] Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.
[00:55:04] I said, well, first of all, I said, Fred, what do my orders
[00:55:07] say?
[00:55:08] I wouldn't look at them.
[00:55:09] It's none of my business.
[00:55:10] Oh, gentlemen, don't read each other's mail.
[00:55:14] So I'll walk up there and hear what I had.
[00:55:16] F-4 to Marar.
[00:55:19] And the F-4, what year did the F-4 come out?
[00:55:21] What year was that?
[00:55:22] I think the first prototype flew in 58.
[00:55:26] Is that right?
[00:55:27] That sounds about right.
[00:55:29] Just real quick.
[00:55:30] All right.
[00:55:31] So you go through all Air Force training.
[00:55:33] You're a B-52 guy.
[00:55:34] And then you CQ in the F-9?
[00:55:37] Yeah.
[00:55:37] What was that like?
[00:55:40] I mean, they're worried that you can't even get aboard, right?
[00:55:42] Yeah.
[00:55:43] Yeah.
[00:55:43] So what was that like?
[00:55:44] Well, I guess my F-C-L-P was OK.
[00:55:48] And when I first time out, F-C-L-P, I think, this is ball.
[00:55:53] I mean, I can do this and so forth.
[00:55:54] And the guy comes back and he says, well, you were this
[00:55:57] and you were this and you were that.
[00:55:58] That's amazing.
[00:55:59] How do you know that?
[00:56:00] And so forth.
[00:56:02] That's LSOs.
[00:56:03] They grade you accurately.
[00:56:07] And their club, Dave knows this.
[00:56:11] I was in LSO.
[00:56:13] Oh, OK.
[00:56:14] It's hard to get into their club.
[00:56:16] And you can't really dispute what they tell you.
[00:56:20] And after every F-C landing, he's in your ready room saying,
[00:56:26] well, you started out high and so forth and so forth.
[00:56:30] So you guys have now both thrown it.
[00:56:31] I was wondering if I missed something,
[00:56:33] but the term get aboard.
[00:56:35] What does this mean?
[00:56:36] Expand on it.
[00:56:38] There are guys, I guess, who just say, you crazy?
[00:56:41] I'm not going to do that.
[00:56:42] I thought I didn't realize you had to do that.
[00:56:45] Or I guess that's what happens.
[00:56:47] Or they're just what used to be called the guys a plumber.
[00:56:51] And he can't do it.
[00:56:54] So get aboard means you actually qualify in the aircraft?
[00:56:56] Yeah, get aboard is just language for can you land on the ship.
[00:57:00] Right.
[00:57:00] And god.
[00:57:01] Most people can.
[00:57:02] I didn't.
[00:57:03] That's what I was missing.
[00:57:04] Yeah.
[00:57:04] And it's hard.
[00:57:05] It's the phrase of, hey, is this guy going to be able to get a board?
[00:57:08] Meaning can he land his plane on the boat?
[00:57:10] Right.
[00:57:10] What happens, I think, every now and then,
[00:57:12] is you got guys to go through the whole pipeline.
[00:57:14] Kerry calls is the last thing you do in training, traditionally.
[00:57:17] And you could be great at all these things.
[00:57:19] But if you can't get aboard, you're no good to the Navy.
[00:57:22] That's right.
[00:57:22] Because we land on boats.
[00:57:24] And so.
[00:57:24] Oh, yeah.
[00:57:25] We're saying you have a P3.
[00:57:27] Yeah, and fighters, exactly.
[00:57:29] So is that what happens?
[00:57:30] You get sent to P3s?
[00:57:31] You get.
[00:57:32] I mean, now you get sent to P3s.
[00:57:34] You go to helicopters.
[00:57:36] If you can't get aboard in a jet,
[00:57:37] they're going to send you to some other non-tactical platform.
[00:57:40] That's true.
[00:57:42] I've been talking about this lately.
[00:57:44] It seems like there are certain skill sets of people.
[00:57:47] Some people just can't get through.
[00:57:49] Like, for instance, when I was going through SEAL training,
[00:57:53] I would say about one out of every 100 guys,
[00:57:57] there's not going to be able to shoot a pistol well.
[00:57:59] And they might actually not make it through the training
[00:58:01] because they can't shoot a pistol.
[00:58:03] They might be an athlete.
[00:58:04] They might be great at everything.
[00:58:05] They might be smart.
[00:58:06] They can't shoot a pistol.
[00:58:07] Close quarters combat.
[00:58:08] There's a bunch of strict little things
[00:58:10] that you have to follow.
[00:58:12] And some people, I think that number is about four
[00:58:14] out of every 100.
[00:58:15] This is in basic SEAL training or SEAL qualification training
[00:58:19] that they're just not going to get it.
[00:58:21] They're just not bad people.
[00:58:23] They do a lot of other things well,
[00:58:25] but they just can't do that thing.
[00:58:26] And it sounds like occasionally someone
[00:58:28] that can fly a plane, someone that can land it on the airfield,
[00:58:31] someone that can do the turns they need to do in the sky,
[00:58:33] someone that understands the dynamics of it,
[00:58:35] but they can't get aboard.
[00:58:37] They can't land on that aircraft carrier.
[00:58:39] And then it doesn't matter.
[00:58:40] That's right.
[00:58:41] No, it does matter because you were a top gun guy,
[00:58:47] but I was an instructor at Meridian at the end of my career.
[00:58:53] And I don't remember exactly how or what
[00:58:57] that the guy said to me.
[00:58:59] And then friendly is collegial way.
[00:59:01] You know, if your students can't cut it,
[00:59:04] it's not their fault.
[00:59:05] It's your fault.
[00:59:07] Because if this guy is not the sort of guy
[00:59:12] we want for a tail hook, we'll find a place for him.
[00:59:16] And he'll be valuable to the Navy.
[00:59:19] So in the Air Force is the other way around.
[00:59:21] It always felt to me like they were trying to get rid of you.
[00:59:25] They were always rotten to you, except for one guy who
[00:59:29] wound up being a, I think I put this in my list of stuff.
[00:59:32] He wound up being a four-star general in NATO and Europe.
[00:59:36] He maybe was personal self-esteem or self-confidence
[00:59:42] or something like that.
[00:59:43] He was very quiet and struck.
[00:59:45] He was in T-38s and at Air Force Advanced.
[00:59:49] Very laid back.
[00:59:50] He'd say, Tom, come on left a little bit more.
[00:59:53] Or, Tom, let me show you.
[00:59:55] And he did.
[00:59:56] And that was his last.
[00:59:57] And they wouldn't talk to me for 10 minutes and stuff
[00:59:59] like that.
[01:00:00] But not because he didn't want to.
[01:00:02] He'd just let you go until you made him a, no, no, no.
[01:00:05] Let me show you something and stuff like that.
[01:00:08] I'd say, but at any rate, they always
[01:00:10] acted like they wanted to get ready or worse.
[01:00:12] And the Navy, the kid doesn't make it.
[01:00:14] He's been qualified by us in 16 different ways.
[01:00:18] If he quits or wants to quit, it's your fault, not his.
[01:00:26] And so we'll find a place for him in Helos.
[01:00:30] And we have two guys there and stuff like that.
[01:00:33] So where the heck were we?
[01:00:37] So then you do get your orders.
[01:00:39] You get your F-4 orders.
[01:00:40] And I guess I kicked this whole tangent off just by the F-4
[01:00:45] at the time was just like the ultimate beast.
[01:00:49] The monster.
[01:00:50] That's what I always called it.
[01:00:52] And then I went to Mirar.
[01:00:56] And I remembered this like it was yesterday.
[01:00:59] Check in, do all that.
[01:01:02] Going to find a place in the BOQ, forget it.
[01:01:05] No chance.
[01:01:07] I had to go find a place to live off base and whatnot.
[01:01:12] But at any rate, VF-121 was the F-4 RAG at that time
[01:01:16] and was the eastward end of the runway there.
[01:01:21] And a couple of steps going through a narrow gate that
[01:01:26] was always open.
[01:01:28] And then F-4, you're looking at the tail,
[01:01:31] up the pipes of this thing.
[01:01:33] And I thought, oh my god, I forgot.
[01:01:35] This is a monster.
[01:01:36] I forgot.
[01:01:37] And they had Marines working on them
[01:01:39] because they were going to Denang or Chulai
[01:01:42] to get shot full of holes and eventually abandoned over there.
[01:01:49] And they took the radars out and put lead noses in them
[01:01:52] at that place.
[01:01:53] And basically went over the whole thing.
[01:01:56] And they had Marines Mechs working on them there.
[01:02:01] But I thought, oh my god, look at that thing.
[01:02:03] And so that's the thing.
[01:02:06] And then I walked to the end of the hangar.
[01:02:08] And two F-4s taken the runway.
[01:02:13] And VF-121 at that time was at that end, the east end,
[01:02:17] of the runway.
[01:02:18] And 99% of the time, the Mirroir took off to the west.
[01:02:23] And two F-4s rolled out on the runway.
[01:02:25] It was night and early morning, low coastal clouds and fog,
[01:02:29] just like here.
[01:02:31] This is at Miramar.
[01:02:32] And they ran up.
[01:02:37] And then they rolled.
[01:02:38] And they firewalled.
[01:02:40] And they went to Burner.
[01:02:42] And then they disappeared into the mist.
[01:02:45] I thought, oh my god, I am in over my head.
[01:02:50] But you learn to do it.
[01:02:51] And get good at it.
[01:02:53] I got pretty good at it.
[01:02:55] Although, you know, there's a thing about LSOs,
[01:02:59] since you're here.
[01:03:00] So the LSO is the grader, basically?
[01:03:03] That's the landing signal officer.
[01:03:05] You grade every landing.
[01:03:06] That's right.
[01:03:07] OK.
[01:03:08] And you have to call Meepo on state for every landing,
[01:03:13] VFR, IFR, anything else.
[01:03:15] And he's the guy when you look up and they say,
[01:03:19] one peak is worth 10,000 scans, scanning your panel,
[01:03:25] instrument flying is something that's hard to understand
[01:03:28] if you haven't done it.
[01:03:30] You cannot make a mistake or you're
[01:03:33] going to be killed and wreck the airplane.
[01:03:35] No mistakes allowed in genuine IFR,
[01:03:39] and especially carrier IFR.
[01:03:42] But he's the guy who says to you, you say, 2400 Clara.
[01:03:49] And he says to you, that means I don't see the Meepo.
[01:03:52] And really, you can't see the deck either.
[01:03:54] And he says to you, you're looking great, babe.
[01:03:58] Keep it coming.
[01:03:59] And you just have to trust what he's saying.
[01:04:02] Because you can't see visually because of fog or whatever?
[01:04:05] Well, one second later, or maybe a half second later,
[01:04:07] you see the deck and then you're aboard.
[01:04:11] He'll say that to you at a half mile.
[01:04:14] The radar controller says, half mile, call a ball
[01:04:17] or execute a wave off.
[01:04:19] And you take a second peak and nothing there.
[01:04:23] You see a white glow from the deck.
[01:04:27] But if you're on centerline and on glide slope,
[01:04:30] you're going to be OK.
[01:04:31] And he's tracking that via radar?
[01:04:33] Or he's because he can't see you either, right?
[01:04:36] Yeah.
[01:04:37] The ship does.
[01:04:37] It's different now, I think.
[01:04:39] But it's essentially sort of the same.
[01:04:41] You have an IFR had a radar reflector on the nose gear.
[01:04:45] And the ship's track while scan radar
[01:04:48] would lock on to that receiver.
[01:04:50] Otherwise, it might lock on to the wing tip.
[01:04:53] And that will keep you on if you're flying accurately.
[01:05:00] Everything will be when you break out.
[01:05:02] You'll be on centerline on glide slope at the center of Neapol.
[01:05:06] And basically, with a fuel in black oil ship,
[01:05:13] Constellation was America before.
[01:05:16] They were both black oil ships.
[01:05:19] They have a stack gas problem.
[01:05:22] But actually, with a nuclear powered carrier,
[01:05:25] you have the bubble that comes around,
[01:05:26] the wind coming around the island.
[01:05:29] I'm told you can feel that too.
[01:05:31] But with a fossil powered ship, you had a lot of bubble.
[01:05:37] So you're hitting turbulence based on the rise of coming
[01:05:39] to land.
[01:05:40] Right there.
[01:05:41] A tenth of a mile from touchdown.
[01:05:43] Yeah.
[01:05:44] One time, I had my mask loose.
[01:05:47] You could smell it.
[01:05:50] My mask wasn't tight enough.
[01:05:51] What was it?
[01:05:51] Do you remember your first carrier landing?
[01:05:53] Yeah, I do.
[01:05:55] How'd it go?
[01:05:57] I thought that was pretty great.
[01:05:59] That's all I remember.
[01:05:59] I remember being on the catapult, though.
[01:06:02] It was a Randolph with hydraulic cats.
[01:06:06] It was one of the only ships left with hydraulic cats.
[01:06:09] They'd all been converted to steam
[01:06:10] when they put the angled deck on them.
[01:06:13] These old Essex and Yorktown class ships,
[01:06:17] they put steam catapults in them.
[01:06:19] But some of them, they put hydraulic cats.
[01:06:21] And Randolph was still a wonderful, clean, well run ship.
[01:06:26] I thought a little.
[01:06:27] I know the captain was very friendly to me,
[01:06:29] because I was an oddball.
[01:06:31] I was coming across Air Force Officer.
[01:06:34] He had been told, come on up on the bridge.
[01:06:37] It was very nice.
[01:06:38] At any rate, sitting there, getting
[01:06:42] ready to get on the hydraulic cats on Randolph,
[01:06:45] I remember thinking to myself, I don't have to be doing this.
[01:06:50] I remember thinking, if I say, I don't want to do this,
[01:06:55] they'll stop right now.
[01:06:57] I must be crazy.
[01:06:59] I did it.
[01:07:00] Boom.
[01:07:01] But.
[01:07:02] Without your first cat launch?
[01:07:03] Yeah.
[01:07:04] And they told you over and over again,
[01:07:07] these are hydraulic cats.
[01:07:09] Bob said, you're a pal and instructor.
[01:07:13] He said, now, make sure you're all the way back.
[01:07:17] Make sure you've got your elbow locked,
[01:07:20] because it's a hell of a bang.
[01:07:23] And you get, on your first 15, 20 feet,
[01:07:27] you get 80% of your acceleration right up front.
[01:07:30] And then you're sort of just trundled down
[01:07:33] the rest of the way.
[01:07:35] So I was ready.
[01:07:36] But all the way back in the seat, head back,
[01:07:39] and elbow locked, I didn't think about my knees.
[01:07:43] When that thing went off, my knees were up here somewhere.
[01:07:48] But the F9, I think the FAA team is the same way.
[01:07:51] You can take the shot, hands off, and then grab the stick
[01:07:57] as soon as you're out over the water.
[01:08:00] So I still had my hand on the pole,
[01:08:03] but I had to get my knees back down.
[01:08:05] So is the hydraulic harder to launch than the steam,
[01:08:09] because the steam is more gradual buildup or something?
[01:08:11] Yeah, the steam is smoother.
[01:08:12] And it's a continuous flow.
[01:08:15] And I guess the new electric cats are that way as well.
[01:08:19] It's supposed to be even better, I guess.
[01:08:21] I don't know how there would be, but I guess there would be.
[01:08:24] Now, this is the time like Dan Peterson,
[01:08:27] you guys are working almost getting in this air to air
[01:08:31] combat, where you're training at a level that really you
[01:08:35] hadn't trained before.
[01:08:36] Or the pilots hadn't been training this way.
[01:08:38] We're going hard against each other all the time.
[01:08:43] Yes and no.
[01:08:44] In that, that was the beginning of the,
[01:08:48] I said in my talking to Dave via email,
[01:08:52] I said my only claim to fame here, being unusual,
[01:08:55] if you will, is the fact that I was there
[01:08:58] when what became Top Gun started.
[01:09:01] I was there.
[01:09:02] Sam Leeds, who's in Dan Peterson's book,
[01:09:06] came into various ready rooms.
[01:09:07] And VF-121 had about three or four of them,
[01:09:10] I can't even remember because they took the whole hanger.
[01:09:13] And they came in there and said, we're going to do that.
[01:09:15] Oh, a lot of F-4s.
[01:09:17] And some F-8s too, were getting shot down by MiG-17s mostly.
[01:09:23] But RA-5Cs were getting shot down by MiG-21s
[01:09:27] because they were MiG-21.
[01:09:30] RA-5C would be cruising at, say, 600 knots, taking pictures,
[01:09:34] or going to his next spot to take pictures.
[01:09:37] And the MiG-21 would come downhill from 30, 35,000
[01:09:42] at 1.2, 1.4, something like that.
[01:09:46] And launch Soviet, what was the B model,
[01:09:51] they had stolen from us, a sidewinder,
[01:09:55] and shoot down the RA-5C.
[01:09:57] That was the big deal.
[01:09:58] Don't let your RA-5C, if you're the escort,
[01:10:01] and I was lots of times, if you're the escort of the RA-5C,
[01:10:05] don't let him get, you have to keep looking back and up there
[01:10:09] and be prepared to turn into him for a head-on with a sparrow.
[01:10:13] But at any rate, what was the question?
[01:10:16] Well, I'm just trying to gather that eventually what I want
[01:10:20] to know is how well prepared you were when you went
[01:10:23] on deployment from a pilot.
[01:10:27] So I was in the SEAL teams.
[01:10:29] We would shoot so many rounds through our guns.
[01:10:32] We would do so many immediate action drills.
[01:10:34] We would do so many drills and so much training
[01:10:39] that by the time we went overseas, I felt really good.
[01:10:42] I felt really good.
[01:10:44] And I'm trying to figure out where you guys would feel
[01:10:49] the first time you get on your first combat mission.
[01:10:52] Well, there's nothing quite like getting shot at the first time.
[01:10:55] You do remember that.
[01:10:57] But I remember the time they had some sort of an exercise
[01:11:00] where we flew down the coast and back up again
[01:11:02] and maybe went up as high as Hanoi and or more
[01:11:07] the seaport that the Haifong went at the mouth of the river
[01:11:11] up there and back and got aboard and came aboard.
[01:11:16] Big exercise.
[01:11:16] I remember looking out over northern part of South Vietnam
[01:11:21] and over into Laos and all that red.
[01:11:23] I thought, holy smoke, that's for real.
[01:11:26] It's only every one and every six.
[01:11:29] But you're not quite ready for that.
[01:11:31] And the first time you actually see it going by,
[01:11:33] it makes you an older man immediately, I think.
[01:11:37] So wherever we are.
[01:11:40] So you're training to get ready to get over there?
[01:11:43] There's no way you're dog fighting?
[01:11:44] Are you?
[01:11:45] Oh, yeah.
[01:11:46] Oh, yes.
[01:11:46] Yeah, one on ones.
[01:11:48] That's what you did in your training.
[01:11:50] You left Miramar and went out over the water.
[01:11:53] And the standard deal was your flight leader,
[01:11:58] you're the wingman.
[01:11:59] He kisses you off.
[01:12:00] You both turn 30 degrees away and you
[01:12:03] proceed until one guy turns in.
[01:12:05] You can turn in immediately or you can wait.
[01:12:08] If you're the younger guy, you wait until the older guy
[01:12:11] finally turns in because he can't see you anymore.
[01:12:14] You can barely see him and you know his eyeballs.
[01:12:19] Not as good as yours.
[01:12:20] But you turn in and make a head on it.
[01:12:22] And then you can see his wings flash.
[01:12:24] And he sees your wings flash and make a head on pass.
[01:12:28] But that's not the way it is in combat.
[01:12:30] When you get into a combat situation, well, statistically,
[01:12:35] it doesn't matter whether it's World War I, Korea,
[01:12:39] or the Vietnam War.
[01:12:41] The guys who got shot down, the guys who didn't see it coming,
[01:12:45] it's like 99% of them.
[01:12:49] One guy got shot down, let's say.
[01:12:51] He said, yeah, he got it on me and he pulled inside
[01:12:55] and he unloaded and he got me.
[01:12:57] But that's the exception.
[01:12:58] And more over 95% of the airplane shot
[01:13:01] then I popped a pee there in Vietnam with AAA,
[01:13:09] not with SAMs.
[01:13:10] Everybody knows SAMs this and SAMs that.
[01:13:12] But no, when you're vulnerable and relatively close
[01:13:16] to the ground, that's when they got you,
[01:13:20] especially when you could see it going by you
[01:13:22] or in the envelope if you will.
[01:13:24] And that's just a matter of chance in a way.
[01:13:26] That's right.
[01:13:27] Well, better tactics.
[01:13:30] There are better tactics and poorer tactics.
[01:13:33] And I think I wrote in, is that my monograph there?
[01:13:38] Guy said to me way back, in Kingsville,
[01:13:43] I teach you to let it roll off on a wing, let the nose fall,
[01:13:47] acquire the target, adjust a little bit,
[01:13:50] and now you're watching the altimeter and so forth.
[01:13:55] I said, this is baloney.
[01:13:56] I want to hit the target.
[01:13:57] I want to put them right in the hole there.
[01:14:00] Pull down, up, invert, pull down.
[01:14:04] Some ROs think you're crazy the first time
[01:14:06] they're in the back when you do this.
[01:14:08] Pull down as steep as possible.
[01:14:12] Well, more than 30 degrees, you betcha.
[01:14:15] How about 60 or 70 degrees?
[01:14:18] The steeper you are, the safer you are, the faster you are,
[01:14:22] the better you are.
[01:14:23] And then I think I wrote in here.
[01:14:25] Is there any compromise when you go to come out of that dive
[01:14:29] and turn the airplane back up towards the sky?
[01:14:32] Not really, because they've been through all that at Pax River.
[01:14:36] Say the flight test in the book, the manual that you have,
[01:14:42] the NATOPS manual, the flight manual for pilots,
[01:14:47] or the tactics manual has all these tables in there.
[01:14:50] And you can say, if I get out and let's say,
[01:14:54] I have 80 degrees angle of dive and I get out at 6,000 feet,
[01:15:01] I'll still be well clear.
[01:15:03] I have 1,500 feet of to clear if I pull 6 and 1 half Gs
[01:15:08] to get out.
[01:15:09] If I pull 7, I'm even better off.
[01:15:12] But you lose power when you do that.
[01:15:14] I'm sorry, you lose airspeed when you do that.
[01:15:17] So you pull the Gs, you're safe.
[01:15:20] A lot of guys would not do that, though.
[01:15:22] But did you train this way before going to Vietnam?
[01:15:25] Did you know that the high angle attack was better?
[01:15:29] No.
[01:15:31] Were you figured out when you got there?
[01:15:33] No, I figured it out in Arizona, going over there
[01:15:37] to those targets that they have.
[01:15:40] I guess in the East Coast, they have them all over the place,
[01:15:42] too, in rural places.
[01:15:44] It's a huge, plowed area, and plowed in a circle.
[01:15:49] And they have two towers, wooden towers,
[01:15:53] and 12 o'clock at 3 o'clock.
[01:15:56] And they talk to each other.
[01:15:58] And they tell you where your hit was on there.
[01:16:01] And a white thing in the center.
[01:16:04] And they tell you, you bomb.
[01:16:07] But a guy told me, if you want to be safe, be steeper, be faster.
[01:16:12] I said, that's for me.
[01:16:14] And then I saw this picture, sort of famous.
[01:16:17] And you've probably seen it of an airplane diving
[01:16:21] on a Japanese aircraft carrier at midway.
[01:16:25] And the guy is 89 degrees.
[01:16:28] That is for me.
[01:16:29] That's why I'm going to do it.
[01:16:31] So roll inverted, pull into your nose down.
[01:16:33] Then you get your dive right there.
[01:16:34] Because your nose wants to come up the faster you go.
[01:16:37] And an airplane, whether it's a Piper Cub or an F-4 or F-18,
[01:16:41] your nose wants to rise as you build air.
[01:16:46] Airspeed is just aerodynamics.
[01:16:48] So get the nose down there right now.
[01:16:50] And then you can do whatever you want.
[01:16:52] F-4, you could pull a powered idle at 500.
[01:16:56] And it would hold five.
[01:16:57] I don't know what they do in F-18s.
[01:17:00] But then anyway, pull a powered idle at 500,
[01:17:02] almost no matter what your dive angle was.
[01:17:06] What does that mean, pull powered idle at 500?
[01:17:09] What does that mean?
[01:17:10] Just pull the throttles all the way back to idle.
[01:17:13] And it would hold 500 knots.
[01:17:15] Got it.
[01:17:16] So you wouldn't increase your speed to some.
[01:17:18] Right.
[01:17:18] I don't know why.
[01:17:20] It's just they discovered it, no doubt,
[01:17:23] after they were actually flying the airplane.
[01:17:26] But if you go 550, it'll hold that.
[01:17:29] So a lot of guys would say 500 is fast enough for me.
[01:17:32] I've got to pull out of this.
[01:17:33] But I said, Blaney, look on the charts.
[01:17:35] You can get out easy.
[01:17:36] They wouldn't do it.
[01:17:37] But I said, steeper is better.
[01:17:39] So I was surprised.
[01:17:41] The guy in the back says, you know, we were 560 knots tonight.
[01:17:45] Yeah, fine.
[01:17:46] Like that.
[01:17:48] I never got any holes.
[01:17:50] I got scared a couple of times.
[01:17:52] Well, yeah.
[01:17:54] Got warned.
[01:17:55] I had a load go off right there that gave me,
[01:18:01] you know, a picture taken with an old style flash bulb.
[01:18:04] It gave me spots in front of my eyes.
[01:18:07] It was that close, but no holes.
[01:18:10] I never did.
[01:18:12] And the guys who came back with a hole about as big as a 45
[01:18:17] caliber bullet in the bottom of the airplane, but not me.
[01:18:22] We had leadership in the squadron I was in that I kept going back
[01:18:30] to reading your book about how this guy, Ruel Gardner,
[01:18:34] the way he operated.
[01:18:35] And he was a former underwater demolition team guy.
[01:18:37] Right.
[01:18:38] And so how did he operate?
[01:18:42] He was very laid back, very quiet about everything.
[01:18:45] And we get after him about sharks, for instance.
[01:18:51] And he said, nah, he says sharks don't bother you.
[01:18:54] But barracudas sometimes do.
[01:18:56] They're curious.
[01:18:58] And they'll come right up to you and wonder what the heck you're
[01:19:00] doing and what you are.
[01:19:02] I didn't get it right.
[01:19:04] That sort of thing.
[01:19:05] And he was the guy who would do the classic Navy routine, if
[01:19:10] you will.
[01:19:11] Tom, can you help me with this?
[01:19:13] As opposed to Tom, get that done.
[01:19:16] Rather, can you help me with this?
[01:19:20] It's funny in leadership terms.
[01:19:24] If you say to a guy, can you help me with this?
[01:19:27] He may not really want to do it.
[01:19:31] But the way you phrase it makes you want to help him.
[01:19:35] If he says, do that or else and you don't want to do it,
[01:19:40] this is you all.
[01:19:41] 100%.
[01:19:42] You know?
[01:19:44] It's your style.
[01:19:47] But it's effective in leadership terms.
[01:19:51] Very effective to use the old Navy way of doing things like
[01:19:56] that.
[01:19:57] I don't know how the Marine Corps operates, but I had a pal who
[01:20:01] got killed in Vietnam who's told me I will be a Marine general.
[01:20:06] He got killed being aggressive, I think, based upon what I heard
[01:20:11] about what happened with him.
[01:20:13] But to that end, I just wondered how the Marine Corps operates
[01:20:22] when the guy doesn't want to really do that.
[01:20:24] But he would if you had just asked him as opposed to saying to
[01:20:29] it or else.
[01:20:30] Well, having worked with all kinds of leaders in the Army,
[01:20:34] Navy, Air Force, and Marines, the good leaders in all those
[01:20:37] organizations are the type that say, hey, I need some help with
[01:20:40] this.
[01:20:40] Hey, what do you think?
[01:20:41] How do you think we should bet?
[01:20:42] I think that's the stuff.
[01:20:43] And across the board, and then you take this into the civilian
[01:20:46] sector as well, the ones that Barch orders and yell at people
[01:20:50] and say, you need to do this right now because I'm ordering you
[01:20:52] to do it.
[01:20:53] They're not ever considered to be good leaders.
[01:20:56] But that's by and large the Air Force style.
[01:21:00] No exaggeration.
[01:21:01] Maybe my experience in the Air Force wasn't broad enough.
[01:21:05] But by and large, that's what they do there.
[01:21:08] What, Barch orders?
[01:21:09] Yeah.
[01:21:09] Yeah, that's unfortunate.
[01:21:11] Maybe the order, having read his autobiography,
[01:21:15] he didn't write it himself really, really.
[01:21:17] But Ferris LeMay talking about the way
[01:21:21] he operated in England in World War II, do it or else.
[01:21:26] Wait a minute.
[01:21:28] Yeah, well, there's a whole thing to talk about there.
[01:21:32] There's this idea of the authoritarian people.
[01:21:35] Certain people have an authoritarian mindset.
[01:21:37] They're attracted to the authoritarian mindset.
[01:21:40] And when they look at the military, when they're
[01:21:42] 10 years old or 17 years old or 20 years old,
[01:21:45] they look at the military.
[01:21:46] And they're very excited about it because they think, oh,
[01:21:49] there's a place where if I have rank,
[01:21:53] people have to respect me.
[01:21:54] They have to listen to me.
[01:21:56] And so the military actually attracts these type of people.
[01:21:59] And most of the time, they kind of become not the best leaders.
[01:22:06] And they usually don't make it very far because they
[01:22:09] piss people off and whatever.
[01:22:11] Occasionally, you'll have someone that
[01:22:13] gets put in the right circumstances.
[01:22:14] And despite the fact that they're a tyrannical leader,
[01:22:17] they're still able to advance.
[01:22:18] And Curtis LeMay is probably a good example of that.
[01:22:21] Here he was in charge of bombing Europe.
[01:22:24] And he puts together a plan.
[01:22:26] It's like, hey, this is what we're doing.
[01:22:27] And it was an extreme situation.
[01:22:30] And it ended up working.
[01:22:31] And then he gets his.
[01:22:33] They made him a hero.
[01:22:34] But in his autobiography, he says that I had no choice
[01:22:37] but to begin to ascertain that we had to do it that way
[01:22:41] or else we wouldn't do it at all.
[01:22:44] So it can happen.
[01:22:46] But like I said, I've worked with Air Force.
[01:22:49] I've worked with Navy.
[01:22:49] I've worked with the Marine Corps.
[01:22:51] I've worked with the Navy.
[01:22:52] And the good leaders and all of them are not tyrannical at all.
[01:22:56] Now, are there situations that you can get into?
[01:22:58] Or it's like, hey, we got it.
[01:22:59] This is what we're doing.
[01:23:00] Occasionally, that happens.
[01:23:03] But it doesn't really happen a lot.
[01:23:05] And yeah.
[01:23:07] Now, I'm also thinking with your old job in the Air Force,
[01:23:11] where you've got there's no room for any error
[01:23:15] because you're dealing with nuclear weapons,
[01:23:17] that probably emphasized that type of leadership more
[01:23:24] than because the other thing about it,
[01:23:26] authoritarian mindset is they don't do well in combat
[01:23:28] situations oftentimes because they
[01:23:30] have a very structured mind.
[01:23:32] They have a very predetermined way of thinking.
[01:23:34] So they get thrown something that they didn't expect
[01:23:36] and they just fall apart.
[01:23:38] You know, the person that's great in garrison,
[01:23:40] that's great at keeping everyone great at doing inspections,
[01:23:44] great at keeping everyone in the proper uniform,
[01:23:47] they get into combat where all of a sudden the enemy gets
[01:23:49] a vote and there's things happening they didn't expect.
[01:23:51] And people are getting shot.
[01:23:52] And a lot of times, those people don't do well
[01:23:56] in combat scenarios.
[01:23:58] Well, there's something about that that
[01:24:01] just occurs to me right now is that on consolation
[01:24:04] for that 10 month, 9 month cruise,
[01:24:07] I never heard of that happening.
[01:24:08] And you had two squadrons of A7s, two squadrons of A4s,
[01:24:12] one squadron of A6s, a detachment of RA5Cs,
[01:24:17] and combat helo squadron from Japan,
[01:24:21] squadron, whatever they were.
[01:24:24] I think there were two armored heavy duty helicopters
[01:24:28] and the guys who stood by the machine gun.
[01:24:31] I never heard of anything like that.
[01:24:33] Anything like what?
[01:24:35] Anybody screwing up or refusing or being unable to
[01:24:39] or anything like that.
[01:24:40] And they were using real bullets and stuff there every night.
[01:24:46] Yeah, well, it's an interesting thing too
[01:24:47] about the Navy in general is that the Navy in its nature
[01:24:54] when from the past, if you were a commander in my fleet
[01:24:59] and I was gonna send you and your ship somewhere,
[01:25:02] I wasn't gonna be able to talk to you again.
[01:25:03] That's right.
[01:25:04] So you-
[01:25:05] Except with flags and only till you go over the run.
[01:25:07] Right, and then it was like up to you.
[01:25:09] And so we had to exercise a decentralized command
[01:25:13] more than anybody else.
[01:25:15] And that really, when you really pull the thread
[01:25:18] on the SEAL teams, that becomes very clear
[01:25:22] that that's one of the reasons why the SEAL teams
[01:25:24] has a reputation for being very adaptable
[01:25:26] and figuring things out.
[01:25:28] Because we wouldn't get support all the time.
[01:25:31] And we had to, just being in the Navy,
[01:25:34] you had to figure things out.
[01:25:36] The other thing is, in the Navy,
[01:25:39] historically, if you're on a ship, you can't surrender.
[01:25:43] You can't surrender.
[01:25:44] You have to just fight until your ship goes down.
[01:25:47] There's no quitting because you'll die.
[01:25:49] So you end up with that attitude embedded as well
[01:25:53] in the mindset.
[01:25:55] But the, and I think there's a lot of that
[01:25:58] with pilots as well, is, hey, look,
[01:26:01] I'm gonna do what makes sense for me and my aircraft
[01:26:06] to make sure that I stay alive.
[01:26:08] And you have to make those decisions for yourself.
[01:26:10] And so it's on you.
[01:26:12] Well, when I was in Thailand, to my shock,
[01:26:17] flying with FACTS, Air Force FACTS,
[01:26:19] I never told them I was a previous Air Force.
[01:26:21] I thought that's too controversial.
[01:26:24] I'm not gonna get into that.
[01:26:26] I just let it go.
[01:26:28] And they see these guys, Air Force guys,
[01:26:31] doing 30 degree dives.
[01:26:33] And I thought, that's crazy.
[01:26:35] You asked to be at least 45, at least, at 60.
[01:26:40] And of course, what I did was as steep as you could get.
[01:26:43] Hell with it, I'm not gonna get shot down here and so forth.
[01:26:46] But 30 degree dives.
[01:26:48] And I think they all did that.
[01:26:50] And they had the same charts that Navy had.
[01:26:54] So, and the Air Force was known for charts,
[01:26:56] but maybe theirs were even better,
[01:26:58] or more complete or larger than what we had.
[01:27:02] But you couldn't hit the ground.
[01:27:04] Yeah, you're gonna dive in 60 degree dive,
[01:27:06] in the middle of the night, are you nuts?
[01:27:09] You can't hit the ground.
[01:27:10] What happens if they got a tower up there?
[01:27:12] Well, you're still, you're gonna be a thousand feet
[01:27:14] clearer than that.
[01:27:15] So, if you use a 6,000 foot release
[01:27:19] and a 550 degree dive, a 550 knot dive
[01:27:25] and 500 knot release, and a 60 or 80 degree dive,
[01:27:29] you're not gonna hit the ground.
[01:27:31] Don't worry about it.
[01:27:32] You won't do it.
[01:27:33] It can't.
[01:27:34] You won't.
[01:27:35] And what do you pull in seven Gs at the bottom
[01:27:37] of that string?
[01:27:38] Six and a half is what we usually did, I think.
[01:27:40] And if you look down, or you're doing it,
[01:27:43] the needle's just doing that just above six.
[01:27:47] You would look down from time to time at that.
[01:27:51] If you're pulling out, you learn nothing else
[01:27:52] to look at anyway.
[01:27:54] Yeah, I think that's a number you're saying
[01:27:55] as I listen to you talk about it.
[01:27:57] It is a little surprising that you wouldn't do
[01:28:00] a steeper dive, especially in that airplane,
[01:28:02] because you're also more accurate.
[01:28:04] You know where your bomb's gonna go.
[01:28:05] And to be quite honest, like six and a half Gs
[01:28:09] is not that hard if you get used to it.
[01:28:10] And if it keeps you from-
[01:28:12] From becoming ordinary.
[01:28:13] Yeah, it's not that big of a deal.
[01:28:14] Any pilot could get used to that.
[01:28:16] I think the biggest problem is people
[01:28:17] don't like doing that stuff at night.
[01:28:19] And that to me is, it's interesting
[01:28:22] that more people didn't have the same logic
[01:28:23] that you had, which is steeper is better.
[01:28:25] And I just do the math.
[01:28:26] I got a minute altitude to recover from.
[01:28:28] And if I pull back on the stick,
[01:28:29] I can survive six and a half Gs, no factor.
[01:28:31] And I'll pull out and I'll be fine.
[01:28:32] Yeah, because of the engineering knowledge
[01:28:34] is right there on the paper.
[01:28:36] You could see it, but-
[01:28:38] A 30 degree dive seems,
[01:28:40] I didn't even know that was even something
[01:28:42] that you were doing.
[01:28:43] That's a shallow, it's especially in a place like that
[01:28:46] where ground fire, not the Sam's,
[01:28:51] although I know Sam's are always considered,
[01:28:52] but AAA, like a 30 degree airplane's a big giant airplane.
[01:28:56] There's just a lot of airplane to see at 30 degrees
[01:28:59] where 60 degrees or 70 degrees,
[01:29:00] there's a very little amount of airplane to see.
[01:29:02] And I would think that's the math game you would be playing
[01:29:04] is a smaller platform, the better.
[01:29:06] I got one better than that.
[01:29:08] I was with this OV10 guy, I'm riding in the back
[01:29:10] with the binoculars and these two F4 showed up
[01:29:13] and they made about three runs from the same direction,
[01:29:17] 30 degree dives, one after the other.
[01:29:20] That's crazy.
[01:29:21] Are you nuts?
[01:29:22] You always come in from over there.
[01:29:25] And one then that you made one dive from over there,
[01:29:28] you over here for your second, we used to drop pairs
[01:29:32] and we have six, 500 pound bombs
[01:29:34] and make three runs with pairs,
[01:29:38] but never from the same direction, never.
[01:29:41] And when the lead goes in over here,
[01:29:44] turn a little around the circle and come in from the other side
[01:29:46] because that means he's got to turn the gun
[01:29:48] all the way around over there.
[01:29:50] Because he was shooting at him.
[01:29:52] The thing is, that's another thing about the first guy in,
[01:29:55] in the movies, John Wayne is the first guy in,
[01:29:58] it's not a big deal, they're still getting the gun turned
[01:30:00] around and he's off the target by the hand.
[01:30:03] It's the second guy.
[01:30:04] Dash four, that's the last guy.
[01:30:05] Dash two, dash three, dash four, the ones that take it.
[01:30:09] That's right.
[01:30:10] So you feel like you were pretty good
[01:30:12] prepared for that deployment.
[01:30:14] You were out bombing, you were doing these steep things,
[01:30:17] getting ready to deploy.
[01:30:18] I was getting better at that
[01:30:21] and I didn't get good at it until we were over there.
[01:30:24] And,
[01:30:25] and,
[01:30:28] you know, they,
[01:30:29] they don't emphasize, they don't talk about the fact
[01:30:33] that there's a lot of flak and you will see it going by.
[01:30:36] They don't tell you that.
[01:30:38] Because maybe they're afraid of somebody saying,
[01:30:41] not for me, I got a bad cold.
[01:30:44] And I think I got a permanent cold
[01:30:46] and maybe I do a lot better in Iceland
[01:30:50] and then doing this.
[01:30:53] So I don't know, but, the other thing about
[01:30:59] that being prepared was the advent.
[01:31:03] I said to David, the only, my real claim to fame here,
[01:31:08] because I'm pretty ordinary actually,
[01:31:10] was the fact that I was there when Sam Leeds walked around
[01:31:14] VF 121 and said, we're going to start this thing
[01:31:17] and maybe you might want to be part of it
[01:31:19] because we don't want to have any more foreshot down
[01:31:23] by MiG-17s, not so much 21s, but MiG-17s.
[01:31:27] What do they call it?
[01:31:28] Was it called the Advanced Gunnery School?
[01:31:30] Do you remember what it was called?
[01:31:30] No, they called it Navy Advanced Fighter Weapon School.
[01:31:34] Okay.
[01:31:35] Or it could, I think initially they said,
[01:31:38] it might be called something like that.
[01:31:40] It was all very loose.
[01:31:42] And I think they had okay for somebody
[01:31:45] on the Admiral's staff in North Island,
[01:31:47] but it was very loose.
[01:31:50] And they said, if you volunteer, you'll fly extra time
[01:31:56] and maybe you don't want to do it
[01:31:57] because it's going to be at six o'clock in the morning.
[01:32:00] And if you don't fly, you have to be here at six,
[01:32:03] at 430 in the morning to man up and run the airplanes out
[01:32:08] and make sure everything on the airplane,
[01:32:11] systems, engines and whatnot, and the radar works
[01:32:15] because you're going to have an experienced,
[01:32:17] good guy in your back seat just for this morning exercise
[01:32:22] so that when we put two, four airplanes out
[01:32:25] on the parking ramp, they all work and all the radars work.
[01:32:29] So be ready for that.
[01:32:31] You will be here at 435 o'clock in the morning
[01:32:35] and you won't fly.
[01:32:37] Ooh, a lot of guys say, forget that.
[01:32:40] So did you do it?
[01:32:41] I did it, yeah.
[01:32:42] And it was, and you will fly ACM,
[01:32:50] air combat maneuver with our instructors and so forth.
[01:32:57] One of my claims to fame is flying with Sam Leeds
[01:33:00] and an A4, they had, at that point,
[01:33:03] they had several generations of A4s
[01:33:06] and they had two seat A4s
[01:33:08] and I think a couple of single seats.
[01:33:09] They had a much bigger engine than them
[01:33:11] and they had, for the instrument rag at Miramar,
[01:33:16] they had a couple with the big engines in them
[01:33:19] and that's when they flew at imitating the MiG-17.
[01:33:24] Don't get close to this guy, he'll eat you alive,
[01:33:27] which is true and that's, Duke Cunningham
[01:33:32] should have been shot down.
[01:33:34] He should have been shot down a couple of times.
[01:33:36] He was very lucky, just lucky.
[01:33:39] But at any rate, doing the wrong thing with Sam Leeds
[01:33:42] isn't my bragging point.
[01:33:45] One of the few ones, he came in on me
[01:33:49] trying to suck me into a, what's called a scissors,
[01:33:52] it's two airplanes who do this,
[01:33:54] one trying to be slower than the other guy
[01:33:57] and I rolled over the top on him and went to Burner
[01:34:00] and I was standing there upside down above him in Burner
[01:34:05] and he said, I can still in my mind I see him
[01:34:09] looking up at me and he said to me,
[01:34:12] I can't believe you're doing this,
[01:34:14] which is the wrong thing to do.
[01:34:16] That would be a last resort with a MiG-17
[01:34:19] because if you screw it up, he's gonna kill you.
[01:34:24] You were a phantom and he was in an A4?
[01:34:26] Yeah.
[01:34:28] But I was standing upside down on my tail
[01:34:31] in Max Burner to do that
[01:34:34] and Sam Leeds was a nice guy.
[01:34:38] Dan Peterson is a little bit removed,
[01:34:41] a little bit standoffish, sort of guy,
[01:34:45] not a bad guy or anything like that,
[01:34:47] but a little bit standoff.
[01:34:48] But Sam Leeds was, how the hell are you a sort of guy?
[01:34:52] At any rate, he said to me, I can't believe you're doing that.
[01:34:57] Aviation and sticking rudder stuff.
[01:35:01] Okay, so now you're deploying to Vietnam.
[01:35:03] Do you just load on the aircraft carrier?
[01:35:04] You're on the USS Constellation?
[01:35:06] No, you're going on mini-cruise
[01:35:08] for Monday through Friday,
[01:35:12] it was supposed to be or it was,
[01:35:15] for a month, for four weeks.
[01:35:20] Well, before they let you near the ship,
[01:35:23] you have to, pure care quality, that's all you do.
[01:35:26] And we went to the East Coast to do that.
[01:35:29] The bunch I was with and it was winter time.
[01:35:34] Poopy suits back in those days, rubber immersion suits.
[01:35:38] Did you ever wear one?
[01:35:39] Absolutely, yeah.
[01:35:41] Good times.
[01:35:43] What is this in case you're ejecting the water?
[01:35:45] The water's below a certain temperature,
[01:35:46] you die super fast, so you got to wear this
[01:35:48] immersion suit in case you eject into the ocean.
[01:35:50] So it's just a big rubber suit that sucks.
[01:35:53] I'm not going to complain about it in front of a seal.
[01:35:55] It's not cool.
[01:35:56] No, it's the water and air temperature,
[01:36:00] less than a certain number.
[01:36:01] And they're not supposed to leak,
[01:36:04] but everybody, power chute rigors and people like that,
[01:36:08] I'm saying, don't worry, they all leak.
[01:36:11] And the other thing is getting into this thing.
[01:36:13] The zipper goes from here to down here somewhere.
[01:36:18] So how do you get your head through there?
[01:36:20] Basically, shoulders up, get somebody to help you
[01:36:24] and pull it up over your head
[01:36:26] and then he lets go and it takes your ears off,
[01:36:28] so to speak, and pulling down because it makes
[01:36:31] a tight seal around your neck and above your neck.
[01:36:36] I guess you have no protection from the seawater either,
[01:36:39] but I don't know.
[01:36:41] And then around the wrists, so your hands
[01:36:44] are going to get ice cold.
[01:36:46] The problem is you, in that, maybe you know this,
[01:36:51] in cold water like that, North Atlantic and whatnot,
[01:36:54] you stop breathing, you can't breathe,
[01:36:57] you're fully conscious, but your diaphragm cools down
[01:37:02] and it won't work for you.
[01:37:04] So you're going to drown because now your swimming ability
[01:37:09] is falling than your diaphragm just will not make,
[01:37:15] get oxygen for you.
[01:37:19] You're done.
[01:37:21] But then my first traps in the F4
[01:37:24] were in a poopy suit off Norfolk in March or February.
[01:37:30] I can't remember, not that it matters.
[01:37:33] And then you board the carrier and you guys sail over?
[01:37:38] Yeah, once you get, they give you, well they did,
[01:37:41] I don't know how they do it now, but in the F4,
[01:37:43] they gave you about four day traps.
[01:37:45] One, your initial, in my case I flew aboard,
[01:37:49] you fly aboard, you walk off, but your initial day trap
[01:37:55] and then next day, maybe two, maybe one,
[01:38:00] and so we're getting you used to the whole idea.
[01:38:03] And after you have about four, five, or six,
[01:38:06] I can't remember what it was.
[01:38:07] Then you get your first night, which is thrilling.
[01:38:13] Nick Far, Nick Soho.
[01:38:16] What's Nick Far?
[01:38:17] German.
[01:38:19] What does it mean?
[01:38:20] Not so.
[01:38:21] Oh, okay.
[01:38:24] He's just being facetious when he's in the industry.
[01:38:26] Yeah, no.
[01:38:28] Burke Burkey.
[01:38:29] Anyway, I got my first night,
[01:38:33] they shot me off the bow of America, CV-A66,
[01:38:38] and I thought, holy smoke, it's being shot into a cave,
[01:38:42] and I can't fly this crazy thing, calm down Tom.
[01:38:45] All right, and you go up and around and get on the downwind.
[01:38:48] Don't look at the ship, they told you.
[01:38:50] Do not look over at the ship,
[01:38:51] it will give you a case of vertigo
[01:38:54] or spatial disorientation.
[01:38:56] Do not look at the ship.
[01:38:58] You just look at your instruments?
[01:38:59] Yeah.
[01:39:00] And it was an overcast night, so high overcast.
[01:39:05] I could see the ship in the corner of my eye over here,
[01:39:09] driving on the downwind, driving on the downwind,
[01:39:12] and I just sat over there and took a look.
[01:39:15] That's what they told you, don't look at the ship?
[01:39:18] Don't look at the ship.
[01:39:19] I did, I can tell you.
[01:39:21] Well, I don't understand, why does it freak you out?
[01:39:23] I have no idea.
[01:39:24] Is that the same thing they told you, Dave?
[01:39:26] Yeah, so it's just a spatial thing, you look out,
[01:39:29] there's no, when he's talking about, there's no horizon.
[01:39:31] You have no sense of where flat or level
[01:39:33] or the sky and the water meet.
[01:39:35] And so if you look over, which we all do,
[01:39:37] because you'll find the downwind,
[01:39:38] if you look to your left, the ship is there,
[01:39:39] you cannot not look.
[01:39:41] Oh, yeah.
[01:39:43] And then you get confused.
[01:39:44] The lights give you disorient you as to,
[01:39:46] when you see lights, lights should either be up or down,
[01:39:49] so it creates disorientation,
[01:39:51] which you can recover from by looking at instruments,
[01:39:53] but don't look at the ship,
[01:39:55] everybody's told the same thing.
[01:39:56] There's no line between the blackness that is the water,
[01:40:00] the blackness that is behind the ship,
[01:40:02] and the blackness that is over the ship.
[01:40:04] The ship is just sort of floating
[01:40:06] in black space somehow or other.
[01:40:09] I'm getting dizzy just thinking about it.
[01:40:12] Do you ever get used to landing on the carrier?
[01:40:15] Well, that's part, this second part of this.
[01:40:17] So I got aboard and went below.
[01:40:20] And there's a Lieutenant Commander,
[01:40:21] a nice guy from Miramar,
[01:40:23] who was there getting re-upped to go to sea.
[01:40:27] And I went to the ward room on Constellation,
[01:40:31] the main ward room was the second deck.
[01:40:34] So I went down there and I got my coffee
[01:40:36] and I got my donut or whatever it was.
[01:40:39] And he said, pretty dark out there.
[01:40:40] And I said, phew, I had no idea.
[01:40:44] I thought I would know, but he said,
[01:40:47] well, you'll get used to it in the daytime.
[01:40:50] It gets to be fun in the daytime, which is true,
[01:40:54] but nobody ever likes it at night, which is true.
[01:40:59] They have confirmed.
[01:41:00] 100%
[01:41:01] Daytime can be fun, nighttime not so much.
[01:41:05] That's right, it's 100% true.
[01:41:06] Full moon is pretty easy?
[01:41:08] No, it's worse because you got shadows
[01:41:11] and you'd make a turn and the moon is there
[01:41:15] and it puts a light across your cockpit
[01:41:18] and it travels across and gives you
[01:41:21] a mild case of special disorientation.
[01:41:24] You don't want that, black is better.
[01:41:26] And then you just on the gauges
[01:41:28] and that's an end of it until the guy says,
[01:41:31] three quarters of a mile, call a ball.
[01:41:33] And assuming you're on centerline,
[01:41:38] on glidescope at that point,
[01:41:40] that basically you just got to wait it out.
[01:41:43] But that's how I got in trouble,
[01:41:45] so which is in those notes.
[01:41:48] Are you looking at my notes?
[01:41:49] Different notes, but it comes from the same thing.
[01:41:52] What got you in trouble?
[01:41:53] I'm interested just.
[01:41:54] Lower your nose in close, come down one wire.
[01:41:57] Not good.
[01:41:58] What happened?
[01:42:00] Well, you bolted and you said.
[01:42:03] What's that mean?
[01:42:04] I'm sorry, no wire, you don't get a wire
[01:42:06] and the lights come on and you're off the angle.
[01:42:09] Oh, okay, you're too high into land.
[01:42:10] Stay too high.
[01:42:11] You miss.
[01:42:12] It can happen, you can be innocent
[01:42:14] and the wires are staggered.
[01:42:16] They're not the same space so that if you have a hook skip,
[01:42:20] you can even hook skip two wires.
[01:42:22] It has happened and off the angle you go and rats.
[01:42:27] What'd you call it?
[01:42:28] What's the verb for it?
[01:42:29] Bolter.
[01:42:30] Bolter?
[01:42:31] B-O-L-T-E-R.
[01:42:32] That means that you miss the wire.
[01:42:33] Yeah, and the L-S-O, he's very helpful.
[01:42:35] You know what he says?
[01:42:37] Bolter bolt, bolter bolt.
[01:42:38] Yeah, thanks a lot.
[01:42:41] And so as soon as you miss, you have to floor.
[01:42:45] Well, when you touch down, you go to full power.
[01:42:48] Oh, that's regardless, okay.
[01:42:50] Yeah, basic engine and from time to time on the F-4 anyway,
[01:42:54] the engines would be slightly misrigged
[01:42:56] and one of them would go to Minn Burner
[01:42:59] and the ship would go ape shit and telling,
[01:43:01] oh no, you've got to do yelling at you,
[01:43:04] come out of a burner and things like that.
[01:43:05] Didn't mean anything.
[01:43:06] So you have the bolter bolter, then what happens?
[01:43:10] Did he say he got you into trouble?
[01:43:11] Yeah, I guess the ship is on the same,
[01:43:13] their radar facility, the CCI, is on the same frequency
[01:43:19] and they hear the L-S-O say bolter bolter
[01:43:22] and they'll say two and two.
[01:43:25] Continue straight ahead to 500 feet, turn left heading
[01:43:29] bus and so which would be a crosswind
[01:43:31] and then you do that and climate maintain 1200 feet
[01:43:35] or 1000 feet or whatever it is and turn left to bus
[01:43:39] and so on, then you're on the downwind
[01:43:41] and then they will, you have more planes coming in,
[01:43:44] coming down from the holding chute if you will
[01:43:47] and they'll squeeze you in in the middle there
[01:43:52] or they'll take you way down till one guy is early
[01:43:55] and one guy's a little, you push over from those altitude
[01:43:58] at an exact you're supposed to to the second timing
[01:44:04] from the sack and some guys are a little bit early,
[01:44:09] guys are a little bit late.
[01:44:10] They can squeeze you in.
[01:44:11] And it squeeze you in, in there
[01:44:13] and then you get aboard the second time, we hope.
[01:44:18] But at any rate, how do you bolter?
[01:44:21] If you hook skip or you're high and laying along.
[01:44:24] So I get in trouble because I boltered
[01:44:26] and I'm not gonna do this two nights in a row
[01:44:31] and it's almost unconscious, lower nose and close.
[01:44:36] What, that's a move that you make to try
[01:44:38] and make sure you're not high?
[01:44:38] And that airplane comes down like a safe
[01:44:42] and they also call a taxi one wire
[01:44:47] in that you land before or you hook does well
[01:44:51] before the one wire and you taxi into the one wire.
[01:44:56] And thank heavens we're aboard
[01:44:58] and that's enough for this for tonight and so forth.
[01:45:01] So out of the next say 10 nights, I got,
[01:45:06] well at the end let's say I got six come down in close.
[01:45:11] So rule Gardner came to me and he said,
[01:45:14] Tom in the passageway too,
[01:45:16] that's another thing laid back in the passageway, Tom.
[01:45:19] I don't want you to fly tomorrow
[01:45:21] and you're not on the schedule because I don't like this.
[01:45:26] And I don't want to make Pamela widow.
[01:45:30] Oh, we had been married about 14 months at that point.
[01:45:37] So he said, I want you to think about it.
[01:45:40] This is not a punishment,
[01:45:41] but I want you to think about lower nose and close.
[01:45:44] And so if I fly that meat bolter touchdown,
[01:45:46] that was an hundred of it, but that's the way he was.
[01:45:51] Leadership again, very laid back.
[01:45:54] I don't want you to fly rather than almost indicating
[01:45:58] if you wanted to fly badly enough,
[01:46:00] go to the schedules of office and Tom
[01:46:02] to put yourself back on the schedule.
[01:46:04] But no, do any of that.
[01:46:06] Just.
[01:46:07] So you bolter bolter one time?
[01:46:11] No, like four out of six the week before
[01:46:15] and that's why he did that.
[01:46:16] God.
[01:46:17] So once it got in your head.
[01:46:19] And it's almost unconscious.
[01:46:21] I think Dave can vouch to that.
[01:46:23] You do it without really thinking about it.
[01:46:26] Yeah.
[01:46:27] You don't say, as soon as I get past the ramp,
[01:46:30] I'm gonna lower the nose.
[01:46:32] It's a bad habit that you don't know why you do it
[01:46:36] and you do it.
[01:46:37] So after you sit down for 24 hours and think,
[01:46:41] that is dangerous, that is stupid
[01:46:43] and you've seen pictures,
[01:46:46] flight deck pictures of lower nose.
[01:46:49] I'm not gonna do that anymore.
[01:46:49] Is it a case of overcompensation, Dave?
[01:46:51] Like subconscious overcompensation that you put,
[01:46:54] you get over the ramp and you crank it down a little bit
[01:46:57] because you want to be early
[01:46:58] because you don't want to be long.
[01:46:59] I think that feeling, the first time you bolter at night
[01:47:02] is a really awful feeling
[01:47:04] because all you want to do is land.
[01:47:06] Like you just, you would trade anything you have
[01:47:08] just to be on that flight deck.
[01:47:09] And so you do all this work.
[01:47:11] Tom was talking about the timing down to the second.
[01:47:13] There's a lot of work to get you to three quarters of a mile.
[01:47:16] It's a lot of work from the stack down
[01:47:18] to the end of the runway or end of the ship.
[01:47:20] And typically when you bolter,
[01:47:22] it's because in the last probably three seconds
[01:47:25] of a however long.
[01:47:26] Or a less than a minute.
[01:47:27] Yeah, or two seconds, you make one little error
[01:47:29] in the last two seconds and it pushes you past the wires
[01:47:32] by five feet.
[01:47:34] And then you're back in the air again
[01:47:35] and you don't want to be there.
[01:47:37] And so I think in your mind, you say, when I get in close,
[01:47:40] the term is called in close to at the ramp.
[01:47:41] It's the last three or four seconds of flying.
[01:47:43] I am not going to add power.
[01:47:45] He mentioned something earlier about something
[01:47:48] called the Burble, which is a real thing.
[01:47:51] And the wind that goes over the flight deck,
[01:47:53] especially in a conventional carrier
[01:47:55] that has to make its own wind,
[01:47:56] meaning it has to run the engines to get speed.
[01:47:58] You have to have 30 knots of wind over the flight deck.
[01:48:01] That Burble, the way the wind goes over the flight deck
[01:48:03] and right at the end of the runway,
[01:48:05] it curves down towards the water,
[01:48:07] will literally pull your airplane down
[01:48:09] just a couple of feet.
[01:48:10] But if you add the Burble,
[01:48:11] three or four feet, it's going to pull you down.
[01:48:13] And that destroys part of your lift as well.
[01:48:16] Absolutely.
[01:48:17] And then that psychological piece of,
[01:48:20] I am not going to go high.
[01:48:22] That six or seven foot difference
[01:48:24] will put your plane in the back of the ship
[01:48:26] and literally blow it up.
[01:48:27] That's the video he's talking about.
[01:48:28] And I think the combination of those two
[01:48:29] creates a really, really dangerous combination
[01:48:33] of the psychology you talked about
[01:48:34] and the actual aerodynamics of it.
[01:48:36] And I would say just a high majority,
[01:48:40] if not almost all of the mishaps around the ship
[01:48:42] aren't really because of mechanical or engine problems,
[01:48:44] it's because of that scenario.
[01:48:46] And the LSO has probably went to the CO
[01:48:48] and said, hey, you got to talk to this guy
[01:48:50] because he's going to kill himself.
[01:48:52] And that's when the skipper,
[01:48:54] and I'm obviously putting words in his mouth
[01:48:56] based on common experience.
[01:48:57] I didn't talk about it specifically,
[01:48:58] but it sounds like I'm hitting close
[01:48:59] to the market that feeling.
[01:49:00] Yes you are.
[01:49:01] Yeah, that's what happens.
[01:49:03] It's all very laid back too, as a matter of fact.
[01:49:05] The LSO, he earlier that night said to you, Tom,
[01:49:11] this is your third bolt of the Lorno's in close
[01:49:15] in a row, this is not good, you got to work on this.
[01:49:19] And then four hours later,
[01:49:21] he came to me in the passenger way and said,
[01:49:23] we're not going to do this, we got to change.
[01:49:27] Dave, how many times did you bolt or bolt her?
[01:49:31] I probably, so on my first cruise,
[01:49:34] I had no bolters on my second cruise, I had one bolter.
[01:49:37] Oh boy.
[01:49:38] In training, when you're talking about CQ,
[01:49:43] night CQ, I bet I had at least one,
[01:49:47] if not two bolters at night.
[01:49:48] What's night CQ?
[01:49:49] No, I'm sorry, night carrier qualifications.
[01:49:52] Got it.
[01:49:53] The night.
[01:49:53] Before you deploy.
[01:49:54] Before you deploy, so the night CQ,
[01:49:57] I had probably a relatively small handful.
[01:50:00] Once you're on cruise and on the way,
[01:50:02] it doesn't happen all that often,
[01:50:03] but the thing that's crazy is probably some
[01:50:06] of the worst flying you'll ever do is off the coast
[01:50:09] of California, because it's overcast at 800 feet
[01:50:11] all the time, even though it's beautiful
[01:50:13] Southern California weather.
[01:50:14] So it's pitch black underneath that overcast,
[01:50:17] even if there is a full moon,
[01:50:18] because there's a big cloud layer there,
[01:50:19] and the Pacific Ocean likes to move around,
[01:50:22] the ship moves around and it sucks, it's awful.
[01:50:26] He flew a much harder plane to get aboard the ship
[01:50:29] than I ever did, so what he did was harder.
[01:50:31] You're talking about, you might have had four of these
[01:50:32] in your career, you had four of them in six flights.
[01:50:35] Nice flight nights.
[01:50:36] Yeah.
[01:50:37] That's enough to freak someone out first.
[01:50:38] Yeah, I don't know.
[01:50:41] The F-4 was an ancient airplane in a manner of speaking,
[01:50:44] and the F-18 is a different breed of cat completely.
[01:50:48] And I was told the F-18 is actually a fun airplane,
[01:50:51] easy airplane to fly, and then you have to work
[01:50:55] to get really good at it, but that's something else.
[01:50:58] The F-4, first time I flew the F-4 with my instructor
[01:51:02] and about cockpit, we went back,
[01:51:04] you take off and go out over the Pacific, off Miramar,
[01:51:08] and headed north, and he said,
[01:51:11] you can level off here at 15,000,
[01:51:13] or more or less, it didn't matter.
[01:51:16] And I tried to level off, and I thought,
[01:51:18] I can't even fly this thing straight and level.
[01:51:21] But the F-4 was designed to be an unstable platform,
[01:51:27] and then they put three axial axis stabilizing
[01:51:32] devices in there, and the early models had a single switch,
[01:51:36] and then they put three separate switches
[01:51:38] for pitch rolling and yaw.
[01:51:41] And a lot of guys, at the end, I would turn the roll off,
[01:51:44] most guys did total roll off, but at any rate,
[01:51:47] it was an unstable airplane, so if you touch the stick
[01:51:49] a little bit, it'll do that, you touch the stick,
[01:51:52] it turns off the stabilizing system.
[01:51:56] When you touch the stick, there are micro switches
[01:51:58] in the base of the physical hand grip,
[01:52:02] and as soon as you touch it a little bit,
[01:52:05] it turns off the roll stab.
[01:52:07] You pull back just a little bit, turns off the,
[01:52:10] just a little bit, so actually before you fly the airplane,
[01:52:15] they'd want you to get familiar with the cockpit
[01:52:17] and so forth, and they say to you,
[01:52:21] realize that this system is there,
[01:52:23] and if it's quiet, you can hear the micro switches click,
[01:52:27] and you can't, but you just gotta touch them,
[01:52:29] and you click it, click it, very faint,
[01:52:32] but they're in there, and it turns off the roll stab,
[01:52:35] so here you are your first time out with this thing,
[01:52:38] and you touch it a little bit, and it turns off the micro stab,
[01:52:41] the stabilization in pitch, and it does one of these,
[01:52:46] and because you go the other way, and it keeps it off,
[01:52:48] and so forth, and then you push it a little bit this way,
[01:52:51] and it turns that off too, and then you go back,
[01:52:54] and so forth.
[01:52:55] And there, it only turns it off for half a second
[01:52:58] or something like that, but if you hit it again,
[01:53:00] it turns about.
[01:53:01] If you over-correct the other side,
[01:53:02] and it's just off.
[01:53:03] So forth, and so forth, and so forth, yeah, so.
[01:53:05] But the F-A-18 is a modern airplane,
[01:53:08] the F-4 was just an airplane that Mr. McDonald said,
[01:53:12] I want a monster, and I wanted to do this,
[01:53:15] that, and the other thing, and if you have a problem
[01:53:19] with it, it won't do that, add a system to do that,
[01:53:22] and they did, and they kept on doing that,
[01:53:25] and that's what you got, and you got a hell of an airplane,
[01:53:28] but my favorite quote about the F-4 was a Marine,
[01:53:32] and one of the books, as you might suspect,
[01:53:35] I have airplane books and whatnot,
[01:53:38] and he said, I flew the F-4 for three years,
[01:53:41] and it never killed me.
[01:53:46] So now you get to Vietnam, what's your mission?
[01:53:50] What are you guys doing?
[01:53:52] Ho Chi Minh Trail, Ho Chi Minh Trail, Ho Chi Minh Trail,
[01:53:54] Latin Bar Cap, it was a bombing pause in the north,
[01:53:59] and the only things were going up there were RA-5Cs
[01:54:04] to look at whatever changes they made,
[01:54:07] probably mostly in the airfields,
[01:54:09] and also looking for SAM sites.
[01:54:13] So you being a first cruise guy,
[01:54:17] you were not gonna fly that escort until you did it.
[01:54:22] I think that's a Navy tradition,
[01:54:25] you can't do it until you do it.
[01:54:27] So for the first three or four months of that cruise,
[01:54:32] I didn't fly any Racky fighter escort up there,
[01:54:39] and then basically what happens is,
[01:54:42] and everybody I think is familiar with this,
[01:54:46] Fred's sick, Tom, can you do this?
[01:54:49] Yeah, I can do that.
[01:54:51] So then you're the escort for the RA-5C,
[01:54:55] and then you're on the regular schedule for that after that.
[01:55:00] But that was the best flying I ever did in my life,
[01:55:02] that keeping with him.
[01:55:04] So what was one of those mission profiles look like?
[01:55:08] Well, launch and point towards North Vietnam, the coast,
[01:55:15] and they were always looking around,
[01:55:19] so half the time they would see you on radar,
[01:55:22] and you have receivers, and they're apparently,
[01:55:26] the F-18 probably has better ones,
[01:55:28] far better ones than we had.
[01:55:30] And you see them, do do do do, looking at you
[01:55:32] as the sweep goes by, and depressurize the cockpit,
[01:55:38] and give yourself a little spacing on the RA-5C,
[01:55:43] and he has promised that he will not go closer
[01:55:47] than 1,000 feet to the undercast.
[01:55:51] He will be above 4,000 feet of the, I'm sorry, the overcast.
[01:55:56] He won't be that close to the undercast.
[01:55:58] He will be 4,000 or 5,000 feet above the undercast.
[01:56:03] He won't go faster, he won't use burner,
[01:56:06] and about four other things,
[01:56:07] and then when you get into it,
[01:56:09] he does everything that he says he wouldn't do,
[01:56:12] because he's shedding in his pants too.
[01:56:14] Because they're looking at you, once you're in there,
[01:56:17] they're looking at you with about three different,
[01:56:20] you can hear the different tones,
[01:56:21] different kinds of radars.
[01:56:23] So what are they doing?
[01:56:24] What's the RA-5C doing?
[01:56:26] Taking pictures.
[01:56:29] And you're just protecting it.
[01:56:30] Right, because the MiG-21s shot down a lot of RA-5Cs,
[01:56:37] and what they would do is they figured
[01:56:40] maybe they're gonna do it today,
[01:56:41] and they put one or two MiG-21s at very high altitude,
[01:56:45] let's say above 35,000,
[01:56:47] because they'd get more speed out of it,
[01:56:49] because the MiG-21 would go 1.8 downhill, easy.
[01:56:54] So they would wait until the RA-5C turned away
[01:56:58] from where their loiter is up here,
[01:57:00] and he's down 2,000 feet taking pictures,
[01:57:04] and then come downhill behind him.
[01:57:07] So your job was to stay away from him,
[01:57:09] and always be looking back there.
[01:57:12] This side too, because you never know,
[01:57:14] but always back here,
[01:57:16] and so stay away from him.
[01:57:18] What people in the
[01:57:23] YouTubes and things like that call Fatch Weave,
[01:57:26] Mr. Commander Fatch invented that in 1944,
[01:57:30] or something like that, and it's absolutely,
[01:57:33] Air Force, they always write with each other,
[01:57:36] and it's just useless and a waste of fuel.
[01:57:39] We always stay one mile, minimum,
[01:57:42] mile and a quarter is a little better,
[01:57:44] so you can come back, and so forth.
[01:57:47] So watch out for MiG-21.
[01:57:51] I wanted to be head on with the MiG-21
[01:57:54] because with the F-4 system,
[01:57:57] well before that, off the coast of California,
[01:58:01] nobody ever told me you could do this,
[01:58:03] but I wondered, against F-8s,
[01:58:05] I put the pepper, 35-mil pepper down the intake of an F-8,
[01:58:10] and guess what happened?
[01:58:11] Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
[01:58:13] Then the Sidewinder Growl, which means it's easy.
[01:58:18] Looking, just looking down the intake.
[01:58:20] So I wanted to do that with the MiG-21,
[01:58:23] but I never got the chance.
[01:58:26] And I said to Jimmy, I said, when, my best friend,
[01:58:31] I said, so that you can claim we got him with a sparrow,
[01:58:37] we won't know which, because as soon as that Sidewinder
[01:58:41] leaves, I'm gonna flip to, because you got the pepper on it,
[01:58:44] I'm gonna flip to radar and pull the trigger a second time.
[01:58:47] So I said, when that big guy sees,
[01:58:50] maybe the Sidewinder won't guide,
[01:58:52] maybe it'll miss him by 30 feet,
[01:58:54] and then the kill radius is only 25 and stuff like that.
[01:58:58] But when he sees that sparrow coming at him,
[01:59:00] that monster sparrow, he's gonna shit in his pants.
[01:59:05] So anyway, how'd it get into this?
[01:59:09] Well, I was just asking what that mission profile was.
[01:59:11] Yeah, so anyway, you follow him around basically
[01:59:15] at high speed, and he always said he wasn't
[01:59:17] gonna use a burner, and he had the same engines
[01:59:20] that you have, and the J79 would put out,
[01:59:23] ordinarily put out a smoke trail.
[01:59:26] We got a mod in the F-4, late in the cruise,
[01:59:29] that would stop that in a fuel additive,
[01:59:32] but they had to put piping in to do that.
[01:59:36] But at any rate, you look over at him,
[01:59:39] and he's not smoking, that means he's a min burner
[01:59:42] to get rid of the smoke, as soon as you did that,
[01:59:44] the smoke went away.
[01:59:45] So, and you look down, and the max low altitude speed
[01:59:50] on the F-4, indicated airspeed, was I think like 740,
[01:59:55] and you look at the indicated airspeed,
[01:59:59] and he's not in burner, we're doing 790,
[02:00:03] indicated relatively close to the ground,
[02:00:09] and we're smoking along here, and then you come back,
[02:00:13] and they know what you've been doing,
[02:00:14] although it's a combat situation,
[02:00:15] you're not gonna know what they were complaining,
[02:00:18] but I have a picture of an F-4 coming aboard with,
[02:00:21] and it's big dense in all three tanks,
[02:00:24] because you've been up there,
[02:00:29] if not at the mark, really close to it,
[02:00:31] and the dynamic pressure dense the fronts of the tanks,
[02:00:35] and maybe they don't do that anymore,
[02:00:37] maybe put some sort of a reinforcement
[02:00:40] on the front end of the tanks,
[02:00:41] but those tanks were not reinforcing the noses,
[02:00:43] and they were all dented from doing stuff like that.
[02:00:48] This story is so cool for me,
[02:00:50] because that's like just classic nail aviation,
[02:00:54] what I always loved about flying with the Navy
[02:00:55] in the Marine Corps was he's talking about that missile,
[02:00:59] he was talking about in training,
[02:01:00] like the book says you can only shoot the missile
[02:01:02] from the back of an airplane, that's the rule,
[02:01:04] and that's how it works, and they tell you,
[02:01:06] and the coolest thing about flying with guys in the Navy,
[02:01:07] they're like, I don't care what the book says,
[02:01:09] I'm gonna go try this, see if it works,
[02:01:10] and this missile, which is on paper and designed
[02:01:13] to only shoot the back of a jet,
[02:01:15] because the engines in the back, that's probably heat,
[02:01:18] these guys figured out I could shoot this thing,
[02:01:19] we call it four quarter in the nose,
[02:01:21] and the best part about that is if you launch this at a MiG,
[02:01:24] I guarantee you, he would do exactly what you described,
[02:01:26] because nobody else would do that,
[02:01:28] because the book says you can't do it,
[02:01:30] so I just like listening to your stories of,
[02:01:32] I don't care what the book says,
[02:01:33] I'm gonna try this, see if it works,
[02:01:34] and that big giant intake probably replicated a MiG-21's
[02:01:38] big nose, that big giant engine right in the front
[02:01:40] of the airplane, that's pretty cool thinking, I like that.
[02:01:43] And he had a 37 millimeter gun too,
[02:01:46] in both those airplanes, and you better not shoot
[02:01:50] the pass too soon, because he's gonna be firing
[02:01:52] that thing on a head on, no matter which one it is,
[02:01:56] at you, and you got a piece of bulletproof glass
[02:01:59] in the front of you, in the older airplanes,
[02:02:01] the F-4 you did, so it shouldn't hit you in the face,
[02:02:05] I guess, but he's liable to ruin your radar,
[02:02:08] which could be a problem, if he gets close to you
[02:02:13] with that head on, but as soon as you pull that trigger,
[02:02:15] he's never saw anything like that in his life,
[02:02:19] and he's been told that the F-4 has to get behind you,
[02:02:22] so don't worry about it, and that's what I always,
[02:02:25] and I said, Jimmy, you gonna be able to,
[02:02:27] and we get that MiG with a sparrow,
[02:02:31] because that's the, the radar operator's missile,
[02:02:36] is a sparrow.
[02:02:38] And so what was it that made those recon missions
[02:02:41] so fun for you, just that you're up there
[02:02:43] hauling ass around?
[02:02:46] Well, this goes back to something I put in that deal,
[02:02:49] and I heard the Chappy James say it the first time,
[02:02:51] and I think it's common, but don't get in the airplane,
[02:02:54] strap it on to you, and Chappy James was quite a guy,
[02:02:58] and I talked to him once, once,
[02:03:02] but you know who he was.
[02:03:04] No, tell me about Chappy.
[02:03:05] He was the black guy who was number two
[02:03:06] to Robin Oles in Thailand, and Robin Oles got all
[02:03:09] of publicity and all this, and Chappy James was
[02:03:13] the quiet guy who kept his place and so forth,
[02:03:16] but they made him a four star general.
[02:03:20] He was, the night I talked to him,
[02:03:24] he was the speaker at a dinner, and he had the place
[02:03:27] in the palm of his hand, and then you figure,
[02:03:31] he's probably winding up about now, and he said,
[02:03:34] you've been such a great audience,
[02:03:35] I'm gonna sing a song for you, and I thought,
[02:03:37] oh, the poor man, he's gonna ruin everything.
[02:03:40] He had it made here, and now he's gonna make
[02:03:42] a fool of himself.
[02:03:43] He sang Old Man River like a metropolitan opera.
[02:03:47] He was really, really something.
[02:03:50] So then he talked with the troops after everything was done.
[02:03:56] He was, I mean, he had to strap it on, so that was,
[02:04:01] first time, I felt that way, truly felt that way,
[02:04:04] fly like the airplanes attached to you,
[02:04:07] and the other way around,
[02:04:11] because when he, you wanna say a mile or a mile
[02:04:15] or a quarter of a beam, what happens if he turns into you?
[02:04:18] Well, you go high, and you come up here this way,
[02:04:21] and watch him, going around the bend,
[02:04:24] and then you can go to the,
[02:04:25] because you're coming down here, you're gonna gain energy,
[02:04:28] so you can go to the outside if you figure
[02:04:30] his next turn will be into you again.
[02:04:33] Well, then you can go up without adding power,
[02:04:36] because as you go,
[02:04:39] no, that's wrong, but if he turns into you,
[02:04:43] you can go high.
[02:04:43] Would you fly with the same guy all the time?
[02:04:46] In the backseat?
[02:04:46] No, the plane that you were covering for.
[02:04:49] No, you didn't even know his name.
[02:04:51] No kidding.
[02:04:52] Yeah, and they were all, because they are,
[02:04:55] they lost a lot of young guys flying the RA5C early in its
[02:05:02] career, they switched to mostly senior guys
[02:05:07] with a lot of hours and a lot of traps.
[02:05:10] They would lose them at the ramp.
[02:05:13] So those guys were, maybe they were all commanders,
[02:05:17] which is too old to be just an airplane driver
[02:05:20] on a carrier, but because of the difficulty
[02:05:25] getting the monster, that monster aboard, heavy,
[02:05:29] their launch weight was a little over 80,000
[02:05:32] on that thing, and the standard launch weight
[02:05:37] that has come to pass more or less is around 60,000.
[02:05:41] So 20,000 pounds heavier off, or getting aboard.
[02:05:46] So they had senior guys doing that.
[02:05:52] I think there was one guy who was a lieutenant commander,
[02:05:55] but anyway, flying with him, flying,
[02:06:00] I discovered I could fly like a bird, because
[02:06:04] at that point in your training or in your experience level,
[02:06:10] you start to get that good at it, and I thought,
[02:06:13] holy smoke, I'm doing this, this way.
[02:06:16] Even though at that point I had 1,000 hours of total flying,
[02:06:21] maybe more than that, flying experience,
[02:06:24] but it was something of a revelation to be able to
[02:06:28] fly where you wanted to go and not be limited
[02:06:33] by what the machine would do, especially with the F-4
[02:06:38] when you had all that power, and especially
[02:06:41] when you're about halfway through your fuel load,
[02:06:43] you have a lot more power, because your weight is gone.
[02:06:48] How long did the fuel last?
[02:06:49] How long did you have?
[02:06:50] Well, the cycle on consolation in combat zone was
[02:06:54] two and a half.
[02:07:00] They called it a two-hour cycle, but you wound up flying
[02:07:03] two and a half hours, because they would launch everybody
[02:07:06] and then they would recover you, so I think they launched
[02:07:09] every two hours, I think that's how it worked.
[02:07:11] You know, I never thought of it quite this way,
[02:07:14] but anyway, my traps on combat zone were always about 2.6.
[02:07:19] Did you guys get gas?
[02:07:24] Only from time to time.
[02:07:26] That's a long time.
[02:07:27] Yeah, and the F-4 fuel gobbler,
[02:07:29] and you were always, always sweating fuel,
[02:07:34] always sweating fuel.
[02:07:36] The cycle time, they measure the cycle time
[02:07:38] when you're talking about on an aircraft carrier,
[02:07:39] in the cycle time is launch to launch,
[02:07:42] so if it's two hours, that means a launch happens,
[02:07:45] and two hours later, the launch happens.
[02:07:47] What's bad about that is if you're on a two-hour cycle,
[02:07:50] when you launch, you'll be the first one to go
[02:07:52] in your Phantom, and then two hours later,
[02:07:55] the next launch goes, you have to wait for all those
[02:07:58] airplanes to get launched before you recover,
[02:08:01] so that two hours is two hours from takeoff to takeoff,
[02:08:04] you have to wait for everybody else on the next launch
[02:08:05] to takeoff before you can land, so that two becomes
[02:08:07] two and a half, and 30 minutes, and actually 30 minutes
[02:08:10] is a lot of time to manage your gas.
[02:08:12] You burn 100 pounds a minute.
[02:08:14] Yeah, that's a lot.
[02:08:14] 100 pounds a minute?
[02:08:16] Yeah, that's 6,000 pounds an hour.
[02:08:19] 6,000 pounds an hour, yeah.
[02:08:22] How about hitting the Ho Chi Minh Trail
[02:08:24] doing those bombing runs?
[02:08:26] Well, you always had a, well, what you do is,
[02:08:30] no, I had your flight later, I was always the one,
[02:08:33] your flight later, would call, I think it was a piston engine
[02:08:40] Lockheed Constellation that was out over the water south,
[02:08:44] and he would ask you what you were and what your ordinance was,
[02:08:48] and he'd come back and say, your fact is gonna be
[02:08:51] camera 2-2, and he is currently at the Lusensow,
[02:08:55] the Lusensow-Tacan, and he will meet you at the Lusensow
[02:09:00] and Lusensow of that Tacan, and which would be somewhere
[02:09:05] in northern Laos, and he'll be there in 12 minutes.
[02:09:12] He's on route right now.
[02:09:14] So you would go there, and excuse me,
[02:09:19] and you'd go there, and we'll wait a couple of minutes
[02:09:23] because if you called him up early, he'd say,
[02:09:25] I'm going as fast as I can, and so, so anyway,
[02:09:31] then he'd call you up and say, I'm in your area now,
[02:09:34] here's what we're gonna do, and he had what they called logs,
[02:09:39] they were pieces of wood that were four inches square
[02:09:43] and about two feet long, and had holes drilled
[02:09:46] longitudinally in there, and they had Willie Pete inside,
[02:09:52] and maybe they had a fuse or something, I don't remember,
[02:09:56] that light that, and he would fly over the spot more or less
[02:09:59] where he wanted you to go, and he would drop it out,
[02:10:02] a trap door that he had in the bottom of the airplane.
[02:10:04] Is this true?
[02:10:05] Yeah, and then he would go drop a second one,
[02:10:09] and he said, do you have my two markers,
[02:10:11] and you'd say, yeah, okay, and he said,
[02:10:13] now, they are northeast and southwest,
[02:10:17] so remember they're northeast, they're not north
[02:10:20] and south, they're northeast and southwest,
[02:10:22] and what you want is on a triangle pointed to the north,
[02:10:29] but to the northeast, and sort of,
[02:10:32] and there's a crossroads there, can you see the crossroads,
[02:10:35] and sometimes you could on a moonlit night.
[02:10:37] He said, okay, now, not the crossroads, but,
[02:10:40] and this is, this is really what they were doing.
[02:10:43] That's what you're doing, yeah.
[02:10:44] And he'd say, I drop another one,
[02:10:46] but we don't want to alert them,
[02:10:48] because the trucks are all parked right now,
[02:10:50] but there's a grove of heavy trees, can you see those?
[02:10:53] No, you can't.
[02:10:54] I would always turn my lights out after you get off the ship,
[02:10:58] and how would you put it, comfortable for a couple of minutes,
[02:11:02] I'd turn everything off, because I had a good,
[02:11:05] best RO in the back, and of course you can hear,
[02:11:10] something's amiss in the airplane.
[02:11:12] What's that ticking, what's that thumping, whatever,
[02:11:15] the engines don't sound right,
[02:11:17] you can hear all that even with your helmet on,
[02:11:20] so I figured, and warning light panels for galore,
[02:11:23] so I figured, turn it out, the human eye takes,
[02:11:28] you probably know this, it takes about 30,
[02:11:30] yeah, half an hour, the same length of time
[02:11:33] takes the sun to set, so after half an hour,
[02:11:37] you can see everything on the ground,
[02:11:39] and the facts talking about that, grove of trees,
[02:11:41] yeah, I can see what you're talking about,
[02:11:43] I can see where those roads are,
[02:11:45] I only started doing that after about two or three months,
[02:11:48] because initially you don't know what you're doing.
[02:11:51] But, turn the lights out,
[02:11:54] and turn the panel lights all the way down,
[02:11:58] because the warning panels,
[02:11:59] any warning lights, low fuel, or anything like that,
[02:12:03] that doesn't turn down, as you might figure.
[02:12:07] So I figured, with a good guy in the back,
[02:12:10] he'll let me know, so then you're right.
[02:12:13] And then you're almost daylight,
[02:12:16] when you eyes get truly acclimated,
[02:12:19] and you see everything on the ground,
[02:12:21] even if it's just the least little moon, but just stars,
[02:12:24] you can see stuff on the ground, so then you're right.
[02:12:27] That's what happens.
[02:12:28] Were you always running nighttime missions?
[02:12:29] 99, 95, 99%
[02:12:33] What would cause a daytime mission?
[02:12:35] New on Yankee Station, the first day,
[02:12:39] maybe day two days, days, but then after that, all nights,
[02:12:44] and you'd be on Yankee Station for 31, 32 days.
[02:12:49] Well, what's Yankee Station, what is it?
[02:12:51] Northern Gulf of Tonkin, Northern Gulf.
[02:12:54] Initially they had a second carrier,
[02:12:56] they called Dixie Station, off of South Vietnam,
[02:12:59] and they stopped that.
[02:13:01] And they would have two carriers up North,
[02:13:05] excuse me, on Yankee Station.
[02:13:09] But anyway, you turn lights out
[02:13:11] and you could see everything at night,
[02:13:13] and the guy says, can you see the trees?
[02:13:16] And Skipper wouldn't be able to see him,
[02:13:18] because he's got older eyeballs than me,
[02:13:22] and he didn't turn his lights out,
[02:13:24] or turn them out completely, that's what I would do.
[02:13:26] And he had good RO too,
[02:13:29] and he stole my good RO.
[02:13:30] When his RO got taken by the Admiral
[02:13:35] to be part of his staff, then he took my RO,
[02:13:39] and then I had a teenager,
[02:13:40] who didn't know what he was doing,
[02:13:43] he was right out of the Naval Academy.
[02:13:45] Anyway, so he'd give you those coordinates,
[02:13:50] and he said, can you see the trees,
[02:13:51] that is just south of where that intersection is?
[02:13:55] And he said, yeah, anywhere in those trees,
[02:13:57] because it's full of trucks there, and so forth.
[02:14:01] Sometimes you'd get there,
[02:14:03] and you'd see headlights, but rarely, rarely.
[02:14:07] And as soon as they really hear you,
[02:14:09] they would run back to the truck and turn the lights off,
[02:14:11] or turn the engines off, I guess, at any rate,
[02:14:15] and then you'd do that.
[02:14:17] But see that thing there that you read early on,
[02:14:20] that was, you know, when Lyndon Johnson
[02:14:24] had his bombing pause in North Vietnam,
[02:14:28] the North Vietnamese took all the guns
[02:14:31] that used to be in North Vietnam,
[02:14:33] and put them over in the Lows
[02:14:34] to guard the Ho Chi Minh Trail over there.
[02:14:38] So, where was I?
[02:14:43] The guns and so forth, and...
[02:14:48] Well, how often were you moving to,
[02:14:50] like you mentioned the anti-aircraft,
[02:14:54] the flak that you're flying by,
[02:14:56] the surface-dairy missiles,
[02:14:57] how often did you run into that?
[02:14:59] Was that every mission?
[02:15:00] Every time, every time.
[02:15:03] But they were cool about that, you see,
[02:15:05] you'd get there.
[02:15:06] Who was cool about that?
[02:15:07] The gunners on the ground.
[02:15:09] The enemy gunners?
[02:15:10] Yeah.
[02:15:11] In what way?
[02:15:12] Well, they'd know you were there,
[02:15:13] because they could hear you.
[02:15:15] And in your orbiting,
[02:15:20] what I would do immediately,
[02:15:21] as soon as we get there,
[02:15:23] I'd separate an altitude,
[02:15:25] I'd go a thousand higher on whoever was,
[02:15:29] usually a rural gardener,
[02:15:30] but I'd go a thousand higher,
[02:15:32] and I'd cut across and turn,
[02:15:34] every naval aviator is a left-hand turn expert.
[02:15:38] They're all turned left.
[02:15:39] In fact, one time I met a guy in Philadelphia
[02:15:42] who had the same dog as I did,
[02:15:43] and I started talking with him,
[02:15:44] and then I saw him a second or a third time.
[02:15:47] He said, what'd you do before you did the ad business?
[02:15:49] He said I was a naval aviator.
[02:15:50] I said, son of a gun, so was I.
[02:15:52] How about that?
[02:15:53] So at any rate, in that office,
[02:15:55] it was street level,
[02:15:57] I had an old IBM computer,
[02:15:59] and I had the Microsoft Flight Simulator
[02:16:04] early on, a version of that on that computer.
[02:16:08] I said, come inside and look at this thing.
[02:16:11] Anyway, I took it off,
[02:16:12] and they'd take off, and I turned right,
[02:16:15] and he said, what the hell kind of a naval aviator are you?
[02:16:17] I turned right.
[02:16:19] And it sims.
[02:16:20] I can't remember, anyway, it doesn't matter.
[02:16:23] Sims, nice guy, nice guy.
[02:16:26] At any rate, I would turn,
[02:16:28] I would orbit to the right,
[02:16:30] and I knew that he was gonna roll in from 1-8.
[02:16:33] I would roll in anywhere at the top of the quadrant
[02:16:39] of the compass rows.
[02:16:42] So what made what the gunners do cool?
[02:16:45] You said the gunners are cool.
[02:16:46] Cool.
[02:16:47] You make yourself present,
[02:16:49] because you're making all that noise right over here,
[02:16:52] over the crossroads,
[02:16:53] and they know, the gunners all know,
[02:16:55] as the trucks are over there,
[02:16:57] and they know that,
[02:16:57] and they know that you know that,
[02:16:59] because they can hear the fact flying around too.
[02:17:02] So they would wait until you roll in, until you commit.
[02:17:06] The problem is, they had to get a handle on you
[02:17:09] when you start down,
[02:17:10] because they also know, I presume that they knew,
[02:17:14] that you're gonna pull a powered idle,
[02:17:15] and your engines get very quiet,
[02:17:17] as soon as you do that.
[02:17:19] So if they didn't have a bead on you, at that point,
[02:17:22] I'm convinced too,
[02:17:24] that they used a simple auditory way to track you.
[02:17:31] I think my idea is that,
[02:17:35] if you took a bunch of paper towel tubes,
[02:17:38] and put tape around them,
[02:17:40] and put a microphone behind them,
[02:17:42] and then you put that on the mount of a gun,
[02:17:47] where the barrel got overheated and it warped,
[02:17:49] so we got this gun mount over here, we don't use it,
[02:17:54] put that auditory search finder thing on the gun,
[02:18:00] because as soon as I turn it over there,
[02:18:02] and I can hear it,
[02:18:02] I got headphones on, and I can hear,
[02:18:04] there he is, oh, I lost him, no, I got him back again.
[02:18:08] But the point here is that,
[02:18:09] the azimuth and elevation on that auditory device,
[02:18:13] if you have a simple system,
[02:18:15] you can all the five guys having 57 millimeter,
[02:18:19] or even 85 millimeter pieces around here,
[02:18:22] they know where you are,
[02:18:23] because they can read what he is tracking you
[02:18:27] in an auditory fashion.
[02:18:29] So they wouldn't open up sometimes,
[02:18:33] until you release,
[02:18:36] pull, and add power, and as soon as you did that,
[02:18:41] yeah, that's shit going by from the back,
[02:18:46] and most of it right there,
[02:18:49] because they had time to know where you were,
[02:18:52] and they could hear you in orbit,
[02:18:54] and now this guy was over here,
[02:18:56] and suddenly he got silent, that means he's in the dive,
[02:19:00] so that means he's gonna be over here,
[02:19:02] and turn their guns around,
[02:19:04] more over the guy with the auditory,
[02:19:08] have a dozen paper towel tubes taped together,
[02:19:11] he can hear you, even if you got your engines at idle,
[02:19:15] I think, that's my private theory,
[02:19:18] I don't know if that's true or not,
[02:19:19] but anyway, that's when they would open up on you,
[02:19:21] and yes, every night, no question, every night,
[02:19:25] anytime you were there, they would blast away,
[02:19:30] and...
[02:19:31] Did you guys lose any aircraft while you were on deployment?
[02:19:34] Not my squadron, no, the ship lost,
[02:19:38] I don't know, four or five, maybe more,
[02:19:41] A7s, no A6s,
[02:19:46] A6 guys, I think, were pretty cagey,
[02:19:49] A7 drivers, they all tended to be, seemed to me,
[02:19:54] younger guys, in the wardrobes, sitting there,
[02:19:56] with the guy, I said,
[02:19:57] man, I had a hell of a time tonight,
[02:19:59] I was mixing it up with these guys,
[02:20:01] they had a 57 millimeter in a cave on the side of a hill,
[02:20:04] I don't know how they got it up there,
[02:20:06] but I made it, I came back around
[02:20:07] and gave them another load of 20 millimeter,
[02:20:10] I thought, really, I said, you know,
[02:20:12] you're sitting that far across the wardrobes table,
[02:20:14] I said, do you realize what the aim point is?
[02:20:17] Oh, it's the airplane, I said, no, no, no,
[02:20:19] the aim point's right between your eyes, you're nuts,
[02:20:22] put a 500 pound bomb into that hole,
[02:20:25] if you, any good as a bomber, you can do that,
[02:20:28] put a bomb into his cave, that's the end of that gun,
[02:20:31] no, it was more fun, I went around a third time,
[02:20:34] and I said, you're crazy, he's gonna shoot you down,
[02:20:37] you're gonna feel really stupid,
[02:20:39] you throw away your weapons,
[02:20:41] is what you do when you get shot down,
[02:20:43] you have a responsibility to, in your book,
[02:20:47] you talk about things that are worth it
[02:20:51] and things that are not worth it,
[02:20:53] and I have to tell anybody who's willing to,
[02:20:55] including my old skipper or somebody like that,
[02:20:58] I said, I have a favorite switch position
[02:21:00] down by your left knee in the F4, it's an all,
[02:21:04] it does all the bombs, doesn't,
[02:21:06] the missiles, the missiles stay, but the bombs,
[02:21:10] you have singles pairs, doubles, cluster,
[02:21:14] all, and then all, flip, all,
[02:21:19] this is bad here tonight, I don't wanna be here,
[02:21:21] I'll be back tomorrow, but for tonight, all,
[02:21:26] see if you can eat this load,
[02:21:27] there's only six of them for seven, six,
[02:21:30] what, six, 500 pounders?
[02:21:31] Yeah, that was our standard bomb load, six, 500 pounders.
[02:21:37] As the deployment went on,
[02:21:39] and you're going out facing this every night,
[02:21:41] night after night, is it every night,
[02:21:43] you flying every night?
[02:21:44] Yeah, and when you were in the Gulf, you flew every night.
[02:21:48] How's this wearing on you mentally?
[02:21:53] Not bad, I think at that age, you're in your late 20s,
[02:21:56] I was in my late 20s, no, not a big deal,
[02:21:59] except that air conditioning on some ships
[02:22:03] was not very good, and Constellation was one of them,
[02:22:06] the flight tag, or the O3 level.
[02:22:08] Who did it to a Navy guy,
[02:22:10] where that air conditioning pisses us off
[02:22:12] all the time on a ship?
[02:22:13] Well, how about you just had good ventilation,
[02:22:15] you know, you have 85 degree air outside,
[02:22:20] put 85 degree air in this room.
[02:22:22] That would be nice.
[02:22:24] You know, and my state room was on the O3 level,
[02:22:29] the O4 level is the flight, yeah.
[02:22:33] So there are places in the ship
[02:22:35] where the air conditioning really did work beautifully,
[02:22:38] but we got visited by ABC or CBS News or something like that,
[02:22:44] and they were on Hancock,
[02:22:45] which was in the Gulf at the same time at that time,
[02:22:48] and one of these guys said to me,
[02:22:50] boy, we could see this ship on the horizon,
[02:22:53] and he said, this ship is nice, Hancock,
[02:22:56] but next week we're going down to get aboard the big guy.
[02:23:01] Air conditioning doesn't work here,
[02:23:02] and the food's not real good.
[02:23:05] Better on a Hancock than everywhere.
[02:23:07] I said, well, fortunes of war, I guess.
[02:23:10] Yeah, I had a guy on the podcast named Dean Ladd,
[02:23:13] who's a Marine in World War II,
[02:23:14] and he went into a bunch of different islands,
[02:23:17] but he was talking, he's going into Tarawa,
[02:23:21] and I'm like, were you nervous going in?
[02:23:23] He said, no, it's the other guys
[02:23:25] that are going to get wounded and killed.
[02:23:27] He ended up getting gut shot in Tarawa,
[02:23:29] and was lucky, a couple of his Marines disobeyed the order
[02:23:32] just to keep going,
[02:23:33] and they grabbed him and threw him back on a ship,
[02:23:35] so I think that's the common mental state
[02:23:39] of the young man in combat is I really feel sorry
[02:23:42] for the other guys that are going to have trouble out here
[02:23:45] and get wounded and killed.
[02:23:46] My favorite professor in college,
[02:23:48] University of Chicago PhD, that's a big deal,
[02:23:51] and Econ was a tail gunner in B-17s in World War II,
[02:23:57] and I used to play chess with him,
[02:23:58] and I said to him, what was it like?
[02:24:01] He said, you always figured the other guy's going to get it.
[02:24:03] That's the same thing I would just say.
[02:24:06] That's a pretty impressive statement for a tail gunner,
[02:24:09] B-17 in World War II.
[02:24:11] He was a teenager, yeah, and he said,
[02:24:14] you always, fortunes of war,
[02:24:16] you figured the other guy's going to,
[02:24:18] or you can always jump out, you know.
[02:24:20] Yeah, that's one.
[02:24:23] That would be the worst of it that you had to bail out.
[02:24:26] Any other highlights from that deployment?
[02:24:30] Well, like, as Skepper said to me,
[02:24:34] we want to send somebody over to Thailand,
[02:24:37] and since you have Air Force experience,
[02:24:40] would you like to do it?
[02:24:42] Well, yeah, why not?
[02:24:43] And this is to be a forward air control or something?
[02:24:45] No, just to make some judgments
[02:24:50] and come back and relate how they do things over there
[02:24:54] and how the facts work and stuff like that.
[02:24:57] So I said, okay, and so they took me over in a cod,
[02:24:59] and we did not get shot at in broad daylight.
[02:25:02] Cod went out in daylight,
[02:25:04] and we didn't get shot at crossing or anything out
[02:25:08] into U-Bahn is where I went,
[02:25:11] where Robin Oles was when he made his five kills
[02:25:16] and stuff like that.
[02:25:18] And initially, hard to get to first base there.
[02:25:22] I said, it was like in the movies.
[02:25:25] The cod pulled out onto the grass,
[02:25:29] and the crewmen opened the back door and they hopped out.
[02:25:31] They had shut down the starboard engine and door slammed.
[02:25:37] Starboard engine started up, taxied away.
[02:25:39] It was standing there with my suitcase on the grass.
[02:25:43] This is just like a goofy movie from France
[02:25:49] and World War II or something anyway.
[02:25:52] So I got a guy, a trooper walking down the tarmac somewhere,
[02:25:57] and I said, where's Base Operations?
[02:26:00] Down the street, but you don't wanna go there.
[02:26:02] Why?
[02:26:03] Because we're not allowed to be here.
[02:26:06] We're guests.
[02:26:07] Oh, where do I go?
[02:26:09] Building 386, it's on the second street over
[02:26:13] and it has 386 on the outside.
[02:26:15] And I'm making this part up,
[02:26:17] but there's a bit in the essence of it.
[02:26:19] That's the operations you want.
[02:26:22] So I didn't have a place to sleep or anything.
[02:26:26] I went there and it got a Marine, no,
[02:26:30] Air Force Trooper, big guy, big guy with a sidearm
[02:26:35] at a little lectern inside the door.
[02:26:39] He said, basically he says, who the hell are you?
[02:26:41] I mean, maybe uniform and whatnot.
[02:26:44] And he said, not without whatever he needed.
[02:26:50] So that night I went to the club
[02:26:52] and I meet a guy, an Air Force major,
[02:26:55] and he said, we can take care of you.
[02:26:57] We'll get past that, don't worry about it.
[02:26:59] And he took care of everything and stuff like that.
[02:27:02] But Air Force operations were officially just a guest
[02:27:07] and they were just don't officially,
[02:27:09] the air force, the tarmac loaded with F-4s and C-130s.
[02:27:13] So I got to fly with a guy who flew the OV-10,
[02:27:17] which is a heck of a fun airplane to fly.
[02:27:20] Man, oh man, I'd swap ends in a second with that thing.
[02:27:24] I mean, this way and that sort of thing.
[02:27:27] Tons of power, two turboprop engines
[02:27:30] and designed for the Marines.
[02:27:32] So you could put one in it, a couple of guys in the back
[02:27:35] and they opened the hatch in the back
[02:27:37] and the Marines can parachute out into middle of nowhere
[02:27:41] and stuff like that.
[02:27:43] And a good panel in the bay made an instrument approach
[02:27:47] with that guy and he said, that's really something
[02:27:50] off that terrible panel back there.
[02:27:51] I said, yeah, well, you make about 100 passes at the ship
[02:27:55] and then at night and it's not a big deal anymore.
[02:27:57] Now, I flew with him maybe twice
[02:28:03] and I flew with the C-130 gunship,
[02:28:06] a C-130 forward air controller,
[02:28:10] only at night for him though,
[02:28:12] because it's a big target, I guess.
[02:28:16] We had flown off of that guy,
[02:28:18] but we didn't know what kind of airplane he had.
[02:28:21] And let's see, the OV-10 and two times with the C-130,
[02:28:26] two times with the C-130, there's only there a week.
[02:28:30] And then back out to the ship,
[02:28:38] C-130, no, C-47 had about eight or 10 Marine troopers
[02:28:48] who were there on R&R at Yubon, Thailand.
[02:28:52] They had been downtown and they all looked at it.
[02:28:55] They were like, oh, they're the big night last night.
[02:29:00] I don't know where they wound up going,
[02:29:01] but they dropped me off at Hway,
[02:29:03] it was right after the battle of Hway,
[02:29:06] they destroyed everything.
[02:29:08] And right next to the runway, Matt runway,
[02:29:12] and when we landed on that, Matt runway,
[02:29:15] they're shooting at us,
[02:29:15] because it goes rattle, rattle, rattle,
[02:29:17] and I thought, oh my God, there's something.
[02:29:20] But that's, it was just a plank runway.
[02:29:24] And then the Army was there.
[02:29:25] And I thought, boy, sandbags and logs and mud,
[02:29:30] and oh, thank heaven, I have no part of the Army.
[02:29:33] And anyway, they sent the cod in there
[02:29:36] and the cod picked me up and took me out to the ship.
[02:29:39] So that was the end of that.
[02:29:41] But that was quite an experience.
[02:29:46] Those C-130 guys, they had call-onness,
[02:29:50] they've sacked their parachutes back over here
[02:29:54] and they have a pile back there.
[02:29:57] Really?
[02:29:58] What do you do if you get hit?
[02:30:00] Because in my mind, you get hit,
[02:30:02] you might take the whole wing off or the end of it
[02:30:05] and then it starts to tumble
[02:30:06] and you're not gonna have time to put on a parachute.
[02:30:10] But they did, I think they lost more C-130s
[02:30:13] than they ever admitted to over there.
[02:30:16] Because the one I was on, the gunship, he's at 3,000 feet
[02:30:21] and the 37 millimeter gets to 3,000 feet.
[02:30:26] And the burst went off in front of the nose
[02:30:28] and I hit the deck behind the naval flight deck
[02:30:31] on that airplane.
[02:30:33] I was on the floor as we flew through the smoke.
[02:30:37] And they said, what was that?
[02:30:40] I said, for heaven's sake, it went off right.
[02:30:41] Yeah, but it falls away, don't worry about it.
[02:30:44] All right?
[02:30:46] But we flew through the smoke.
[02:30:47] I saw the smoke go over the windshield.
[02:30:51] And I got the flight C-130 a little bit,
[02:30:53] just steer it around, not a big deal.
[02:30:56] But anyway, that's what I did in Thailand.
[02:30:58] Then I came back to the ship and I said,
[02:31:00] what about this and what about that?
[02:31:01] And that's when I saw those F-4s making multiple passes
[02:31:06] from the same direction at 30 degrees dive
[02:31:11] and not just the same direction,
[02:31:14] but both airplanes from the same direction.
[02:31:19] Maybe you're losing airplanes and I think I know why.
[02:31:23] No talking them out of it.
[02:31:25] I think if you are encouraged to think
[02:31:28] that 60 degree angle of dive is dangerous, you'll believe it.
[02:31:34] But it's not, it's safer.
[02:31:36] It's a better way to go.
[02:31:37] And when I saw that picture,
[02:31:40] I don't know if I said this now,
[02:31:43] there's a famous picture taken during the Battle of Midway.
[02:31:46] And that guy is virtually 89 degrees
[02:31:50] all above a Japanese carrier.
[02:31:53] So that's the way to do it, I thought.
[02:31:55] And besides, gotta get the barrel all the way up there.
[02:31:57] Maybe he can't do that.
[02:32:01] So you get done with that deployment.
[02:32:05] Head back to the States, now it's what, 1970?
[02:32:10] Yeah.
[02:32:11] And you're coming back to America now,
[02:32:13] now you got the protests and all this stuff going on.
[02:32:17] Where's that, are you seeing that?
[02:32:19] Are you aware of that?
[02:32:20] What's, how's that impacted you?
[02:32:22] Very much so.
[02:32:23] And I think you just get used to it.
[02:32:27] The thing that you wouldn't get used to
[02:32:29] if you were a newly married guy,
[02:32:31] and that was me and a lot of other guys too,
[02:32:35] that they would call up your house and say,
[02:32:37] tell you that, tell your little wife
[02:32:39] that you had been killed that night.
[02:32:42] This is stateside, before you went to sea.
[02:32:46] Very evil, that's evil.
[02:32:49] And then of course we had a couple of bad actions.
[02:32:53] There was a Navy Cod, I think an old one,
[02:32:56] with a bunch of guys on board that crashed on San Clemente
[02:33:01] before we sailed.
[02:33:03] That was very bad and made my wife very squirrely,
[02:33:06] my young wife.
[02:33:08] There's a funny thing, there's a funny one here.
[02:33:11] I went to the East Coast and I flew out to the East Coast
[02:33:15] so then I have to ride back.
[02:33:18] So we're on a DC-4, C-40, 51,
[02:33:24] or God knows what, a four engine,
[02:33:27] unpressurized Navy transport.
[02:33:31] And we get to Houston and the guy says,
[02:33:34] ah, we'll be here overnight because
[02:33:36] we wasn't so on the third engine or something
[02:33:42] that's not right and so be prepared.
[02:33:45] We'll have it, it'll be ready by morning.
[02:33:47] So at any rate, we were supposed to be back
[02:33:50] at Miramar by six p.m. more or less.
[02:33:53] I sent her, called her or something
[02:33:56] from the East Coast from Norfolk.
[02:33:59] So she calls the duty officer
[02:34:01] and the Whitehead sailor who's on duty too,
[02:34:04] he answers the phone and she says, is this Mrs. Coppell?
[02:34:07] Is my husband gonna be there tonight?
[02:34:10] Well, it's his ETA and he says,
[02:34:12] oh no, the airplane went down in Houston.
[02:34:15] Jesus.
[02:34:18] So, now wait, it gets better than that.
[02:34:21] She figured she was a widow.
[02:34:23] What to do about this?
[02:34:26] Next morning, coming up the side of the building
[02:34:29] are two guys with gold braid on their sleeves.
[02:34:32] And she said, well, this is it.
[02:34:36] Steal myself, they're gonna tell me what happened.
[02:34:40] I walk in the door.
[02:34:41] No, anyway, funny story and she still likes
[02:34:46] to tell it to her friends from time to time.
[02:34:50] Oh man.
[02:34:52] So there is, there's this 1970, you come home,
[02:34:55] there's obviously a lot of division in America.
[02:34:58] Right.
[02:34:59] And what do you end up doing when you get back?
[02:35:02] Well, the re-asked Tom if he wants to stay or go
[02:35:08] and I said, my father-in-law offered me a job,
[02:35:12] so I'm gonna go.
[02:35:13] And I had too many dead friends by that point too.
[02:35:17] And I said, I think I'll just get out.
[02:35:20] And I said, well, we're gonna send you to be an ACM
[02:35:22] instructor at Kingsville.
[02:35:24] And I said, I don't wanna go back to Texas.
[02:35:27] I said, I don't like that place.
[02:35:30] He said, well, we could send you to Meridian,
[02:35:32] but it's only basic instruction.
[02:35:35] I said, that's for me.
[02:35:36] Cause a pal had told me that he got plowed back at Meridian
[02:35:41] and it's really nice place, nice people there.
[02:35:44] So I said, let me go to Meridian.
[02:35:46] And so they put me in Meridian and I was an instructor there
[02:35:49] for my last something like 14 months.
[02:35:52] And I had good students and mediocre instructors
[02:35:55] and students and so forth.
[02:35:57] I wonder what happened to the best of them.
[02:35:59] I've never been, I've typed his name into Google.
[02:36:03] No, I don't know.
[02:36:05] I had Marines, bloody old Marines.
[02:36:08] As one guy, I was his instructor and then his pal,
[02:36:12] I flew with him a couple of times.
[02:36:13] They were recon Marines, which is this Navy SEAL level stuff.
[02:36:19] And I foolishly said to one of them,
[02:36:22] this is really foolish, this is naive.
[02:36:25] I said, you get healed into Northern Laos
[02:36:29] and you get dropped off in the jungle
[02:36:33] and you know you're going to be there for at least a week
[02:36:36] with plenty of ammunition.
[02:36:38] Really, what do you do?
[02:36:40] He said, well, we hunt for the North Vietnamese.
[02:36:43] They train up there and they're in the jungle
[02:36:45] and they're easy to find because they smoke so much ganja
[02:36:49] that you can smell them if they're upwind from you.
[02:36:52] Oh really?
[02:36:53] So what do you do then?
[02:36:55] He said, well, you move around so you are in fact downwind
[02:36:58] and then you get close enough to them
[02:37:01] and you set up and with your weapons and whatnot
[02:37:04] and you wait till dawn so they start walking around.
[02:37:10] Yeah, then what do you do?
[02:37:12] Oh, well, we kill them all.
[02:37:14] Oh, excuse me.
[02:37:16] I was a little naive there.
[02:37:18] But these are the anyway.
[02:37:21] And the guy who was my student,
[02:37:26] I wonder what a nice guy, both of them nice guys,
[02:37:32] he would say to me, Tom, we're first name bases
[02:37:35] and we're in captain at that point.
[02:37:37] Tom, Tom, Tom, how do you do a barrel roll attack?
[02:37:41] See that guy over there?
[02:37:42] Make a barrel roll attack on that guy.
[02:37:45] Richard, I'm not supposed to do that.
[02:37:46] You know that.
[02:37:48] Come on.
[02:37:52] Make a big rolling thing on the student flying,
[02:37:57] students never look around.
[02:38:00] He's flying over there.
[02:38:01] Make a big mock.
[02:38:03] Wow, let me try it.
[02:38:05] Go away over here.
[02:38:06] He tried it.
[02:38:07] That's angry.
[02:38:09] Or the other thing with him, you fly in a back cockpit,
[02:38:12] you have him setting, all fighter planes
[02:38:16] or Navy trainers have rear view mirrors.
[02:38:18] If you need rear view mirrors in a fighter plane,
[02:38:22] you're wasting your time.
[02:38:24] You are long gone.
[02:38:28] When I came back or let's say from halfway through the crew,
[02:38:31] you become a nutcase in the cockpit, at least I did.
[02:38:34] I wanna know everything that's on the horizon, 360.
[02:38:38] That's the only way to genuinely be certain
[02:38:42] you're gonna survive this thing and stuff like that.
[02:38:45] So you become a minor nutcase.
[02:38:49] Looking around, looking around.
[02:38:52] And so forth.
[02:38:53] Then to a young guy, I would say,
[02:38:54] how the hell do you fly the airplane
[02:38:56] if you're spending that much time?
[02:38:58] Well, you do.
[02:38:59] You get skilled at it.
[02:39:01] It's just time that you get better and better at doing it.
[02:39:06] But I would have them turn their mirrors
[02:39:08] so I could see this much of their face.
[02:39:10] Everything else is oxygen mask, helmet and oxygen mask.
[02:39:13] But I wanna see this part of that.
[02:39:15] I wanna see where they're looking.
[02:39:16] I don't want you to see you, Mr. Wilson,
[02:39:19] looking at the panel.
[02:39:20] I want you looking outside.
[02:39:22] Mr. Wilson, you're down in the panel again.
[02:39:24] I want you outside to cockpit here.
[02:39:27] Well, Mr. Coppell, I have trouble flying level.
[02:39:29] I said I'd rather see you bumping around
[02:39:32] in a little off altitude than getting shot down later
[02:39:36] because it's that important and so forth.
[02:39:38] So with Rich Freeman, I would like all of them.
[02:39:42] So I'd see him trying to fly level and make,
[02:39:46] Mr. Rich, I want you to make a 30 degree angle turn
[02:39:49] and roll out a two seven, okay.
[02:39:52] And he's doing a little bit of this.
[02:39:54] And he starts to get red in here.
[02:39:57] So Marine getting angry and not good thing.
[02:40:01] He said, Rich, don't get upset.
[02:40:04] Remember I told you, you wanna hold the stick
[02:40:07] with two fingers and trim off the pressure.
[02:40:10] Move it and then trim off the pressure.
[02:40:13] Two fingers, that's all you need.
[02:40:15] I really do it that way.
[02:40:18] Okay, well I tried again.
[02:40:19] Come back three six, okay.
[02:40:21] He comes back and he's getting redder.
[02:40:24] I said, Rich, do you feel that in the airframe?
[02:40:29] Yeah, what is it?
[02:40:30] I said, that's me back here.
[02:40:34] Founding on the pole.
[02:40:35] He's got it in the vice grip with white knuckles
[02:40:38] and his elbow in here.
[02:40:40] Trying to fly this thing a light, Rich,
[02:40:42] it doesn't work that way.
[02:40:45] But anyway.
[02:40:47] You gotta relax, I guess.
[02:40:49] Ah, I don't know.
[02:40:52] I don't know.
[02:40:53] I think when you come back and they're shooting at you
[02:40:58] and you get bored at night in bad weather,
[02:41:01] you're soaking wet and you're tired.
[02:41:05] Do you burn more calories, I think so.
[02:41:08] There was a study done before the Vietnam War
[02:41:12] and they did it with A4s.
[02:41:14] And I bet you David knows about this.
[02:41:17] They asked these A4 guys to,
[02:41:20] oh no, it was during, at the beginning of the Vietnam War,
[02:41:24] that's how it would work.
[02:41:25] They had a recorder that put a pen mark on a disk of paper.
[02:41:34] And then they wired these guys with sweat
[02:41:38] and lung function and heart function and so forth.
[02:41:44] And they found out that just what they figured,
[02:41:46] you go in and feet dry and everything comes up
[02:41:51] and you get in the target area, comes up even higher,
[02:41:54] get off the target area, comes down a little bit,
[02:41:58] get feet wet, comes way down.
[02:42:01] And it was way up here in the target area.
[02:42:04] And then you talk to the ship and it goes up here,
[02:42:08] that much higher.
[02:42:10] Higher than the target area.
[02:42:12] Right, because at the ship everything is right here,
[02:42:17] whereas in the target area it's fortunes of war.
[02:42:24] It's good tactics, but to a certain extent
[02:42:28] it's out of your hands, so you do your best.
[02:42:31] But if you're gonna smack the ramp or do something
[02:42:35] bad like that, it's right there in your hands.
[02:42:41] And that was A4s.
[02:42:43] So yeah, you will burn more calories in your tired guy.
[02:42:50] And then you stand around the right room and smoke cigarettes.
[02:42:54] Really?
[02:42:56] When did you quit smoking?
[02:42:58] Well, right after that I quit smoking.
[02:43:02] And how was your transition into the civilian life?
[02:43:06] Difficult, because you are used to a guy who says that,
[02:43:14] he does that, and civilian world's not that way.
[02:43:19] Guy says, can you loan me 50 bucks until next Wednesday
[02:43:23] in the Navy, he comes looking for you.
[02:43:25] And civilian world, you gotta go looking for him.
[02:43:30] Hey Eddie, give me my 50 bucks.
[02:43:32] Oh, I'll give you half of it, it's all I have, I say.
[02:43:37] Okay, so he was a little bit rocky.
[02:43:40] And I went into business for myself
[02:43:43] because my wife thought that might be a good idea for us.
[02:43:46] And the antique Persian rug business of all things.
[02:43:51] So I wound up making friends with a lot of Persian guys,
[02:43:56] most of them Jews, a couple of them I still know,
[02:43:59] to this day I call them up saying, how the heck are you?
[02:44:02] Couple of Muslim guys, all nice people.
[02:44:07] You had to be, because you were sort of all in that,
[02:44:10] I've been in the Navy, we're all in this mess together.
[02:44:14] So I figured in that business I had it,
[02:44:19] because you have retail customers who talk to you
[02:44:24] and say I've been looking for a lesson so typed,
[02:44:26] you know what that is?
[02:44:27] Oh, yes.
[02:44:29] I need it 18 feet, but no longer than 19.
[02:44:34] And I need it thus and so wide.
[02:44:36] No, I don't want anywhere, but I want more of this color
[02:44:39] and so can you do that?
[02:44:41] You get on, as soon as I leave, you get on a phone call.
[02:44:45] Mohammed and you call Hakim and you call that guy.
[02:44:49] I'm saying, I have what you want
[02:44:51] and he will give it to you on your signature
[02:44:55] if your credit is good.
[02:44:58] I figured I called a guy one time and he said,
[02:45:01] I don't have it, but I know who does have it.
[02:45:04] He's an old Armenian guy and he's really crotchety
[02:45:06] and he shouldn't be in business anymore,
[02:45:08] but he's got some nice choice stuff.
[02:45:12] This is in New York, 28th Street, 31st Street
[02:45:15] in that neighborhood, Feth Avenue.
[02:45:18] And I said, I need this and that and this and that
[02:45:22] and this and that.
[02:45:23] Yes, yes.
[02:45:25] I said, my credit, I said, you don't know me,
[02:45:28] but I have, I called those and so and call him
[02:45:31] and you could call him, I don't have to do that.
[02:45:35] I said, really why?
[02:45:36] I know who you are.
[02:45:38] I could have it on my signature.
[02:45:40] I drove away one time with 80,000 in wholesale value
[02:45:47] in back of my truck and I figured that was a mistake,
[02:45:51] no signature, they know who I am.
[02:45:53] But nice people, a lot of nice people,
[02:45:57] not like what you read in the paper.
[02:45:59] Did you miss the Navy?
[02:46:01] Oh yeah, yeah, a lot of pals and stuff like that,
[02:46:06] but you have to get away from that.
[02:46:08] You can't live in the past.
[02:46:10] You gotta keep going.
[02:46:11] So we had a lot of, I keep saying this,
[02:46:15] but I had a lot of fun doing that too.
[02:46:17] So, and down to my wife, I bought a piece
[02:46:22] for several thousand and I came back
[02:46:27] and maybe two days later and I said,
[02:46:31] where's the, you know, those and so?
[02:46:33] She said, I sold it.
[02:46:34] She said, I said, I hope you got more than $5,600 for it.
[02:46:41] She said, I got 75.
[02:46:43] Is that what one of those rugs cost?
[02:46:48] How much one of those rugs cost?
[02:46:50] It depends on what it is.
[02:46:51] It depends on its age.
[02:46:53] It depends on its condition.
[02:46:55] You have to deal with somebody that you know
[02:46:58] is utterly trustworthy because Henry Kissinger got fleeced
[02:47:03] on a trip to Tehran and he knew it after it was all over.
[02:47:07] Well, what happened to him?
[02:47:08] I don't know exactly what the thing was,
[02:47:10] but he admitted to the fact that all he did was
[02:47:14] take that load of stuff that I bought
[02:47:16] and send it to a dealer somewhere to get rid of it.
[02:47:19] Because it was junk and he paid a bunch of money for it?
[02:47:21] It was very embarrassing, yeah.
[02:47:24] And then you ended up in the bakery business, right?
[02:47:27] Bread making business, that where you're at now?
[02:47:29] Yeah, well, this is Jaco saying
[02:47:33] when you're in the middle of the woods, start walking.
[02:47:36] And the guy says, which direction?
[02:47:38] And Jaco says, doesn't matter.
[02:47:39] Yeah, start walking.
[02:47:40] But I knew how to do that.
[02:47:42] So Pamela said, why don't you make some bread?
[02:47:44] And Pamela's brother is, believe it or not,
[02:47:47] in the exotic mushroom business.
[02:47:50] And they have an outdoor farmers market.
[02:47:53] They were used to common in Pennsylvania on Sunday afternoons.
[02:47:57] And give them to Joe and see if he can sell them.
[02:47:59] He sold them all.
[02:48:01] I'm doing it by hand.
[02:48:05] So same thing again next week and so forth.
[02:48:08] And he comes back and says, Fred says,
[02:48:11] you ought to take a table here.
[02:48:12] Your stuff is good enough.
[02:48:13] I said, holy smoke, but I can only do so much by hand.
[02:48:17] So I had a guy that I did business, drug business, antique
[02:48:22] drug business.
[02:48:23] If you find anything like that, Tom, call me.
[02:48:26] How you do and so forth.
[02:48:27] So I was coming out of buy all the time, whatever you could.
[02:48:31] And so I used to go to a lot of outdoor country auctions, more
[02:48:37] country than anything else.
[02:48:39] And they had rugs from the 30s.
[02:48:42] And I'd drive to Altoona, as I did in this case, with my truck,
[02:48:47] Chevy Van, no windows.
[02:48:49] And I buy the rugs for $1,500 because there's
[02:48:54] certain human psychology, certain price levels in which
[02:48:59] a retail customer, knowing that you could pay more,
[02:49:05] but I won't do that because I don't want surprises
[02:49:08] and stuff like that.
[02:49:09] So you know you're going to get them for $1,500
[02:49:12] if you drive all.
[02:49:12] Because you talk to the auctioneer
[02:49:14] and he tells you more or less what it is.
[02:49:16] And he thinks he knows and stuff like that.
[02:49:18] So he drives to Altoona and you look at it and say, yeah,
[02:49:20] I can get $6,000 for this.
[02:49:23] I won't pay more than, have to pay more than $1,500.
[02:49:26] And you do that.
[02:49:27] So I came back from Altoona that day to this guy's place.
[02:49:30] And he's in a secondhand equipment business,
[02:49:33] secondhand commercial equipment, big ovens and mixers
[02:49:37] and things like that.
[02:49:38] They go on forever.
[02:49:40] And he said, you bake bread once in a while.
[02:49:44] And I didn't buy anything that day.
[02:49:47] And I had money in my pocket, cash in my pocket.
[02:49:51] He sent a couple of nice ovens over here.
[02:49:53] I said, I'm not interested.
[02:49:56] He said, look at them.
[02:49:57] They're diner size.
[02:49:58] They're not the full size.
[02:50:00] You've got to find exactly the right guy.
[02:50:04] Probably a diner, but he already has.
[02:50:08] I'll sell them to you for $900.
[02:50:12] I don't want them.
[02:50:14] He said, I can slide them right onto your truck.
[02:50:16] And he didn't know I had money in my pocket either.
[02:50:20] Yeah, he did.
[02:50:21] Yeah, maybe.
[02:50:24] So finally I said, OK.
[02:50:27] So then I had to install them myself.
[02:50:30] We live in an old Pennsylvania Dutch.
[02:50:32] I call them a Pennsylvania German soft brick drafty.
[02:50:37] And they have matching porches on both sides.
[02:50:39] And this is porches in clothes.
[02:50:41] So I put them on that porch and had heavy.
[02:50:45] You know, they weigh, I don't know, 1,000 a piece, I guess.
[02:50:48] Jacks and everything and blocks and getting it up and sliding
[02:50:52] over and installing both of them.
[02:50:54] But I didn't do very much until my sister-in-law actually
[02:50:58] said, you need to put bread with Joe at the skip-hack.
[02:51:03] Farmers market on Sunday.
[02:51:04] So then one thing led to another led to another.
[02:51:08] And then I went to this nice guy at Kimberton Whole Foods,
[02:51:11] who was at the time he had one store.
[02:51:14] And he was on the floor himself.
[02:51:16] And I said, do you think he can sell these?
[02:51:20] He said, probably not, because a lot of us just bailed out of here.
[02:51:24] But you can put it on their shelves if you want.
[02:51:27] Came back the next day and there was six of them sold.
[02:51:30] I said, can I put more?
[02:51:32] Of course.
[02:51:32] So one thing led to another.
[02:51:34] He has about, maybe he has eight stores now.
[02:51:38] And I'm in four.
[02:51:40] So you're making bread every day?
[02:51:42] I work, no.
[02:51:43] I work Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
[02:51:48] And I deliver on Wednesday what I made on Tuesday night
[02:51:52] and sliced Wednesday morning to deliver that.
[02:51:55] Then I work Thursday and deliver that on Friday.
[02:51:59] And then I'm off Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[02:52:03] But I got another racket gone.
[02:52:05] What's the other racket?
[02:52:06] When I ran for Congress.
[02:52:09] I don't know if you know I did this.
[02:52:10] I did know that, yeah.
[02:52:11] It was in your notes.
[02:52:12] Yeah.
[02:52:15] I was supposed to lose.
[02:52:16] And it was in the gentlemen's agreement.
[02:52:18] You want a guy who can lose gracefully.
[02:52:21] And I said, that's exactly right.
[02:52:23] But I thought to myself, this guy, this Congressman,
[02:52:28] he drinks a lot.
[02:52:29] And he may get hit by a truck or have the classic too much
[02:52:33] alcohol heart attack or something like that.
[02:52:35] This is the only chance I'll ever get.
[02:52:38] So I did.
[02:52:39] I think I put it in there.
[02:52:41] I did rank 10,000 doorbells.
[02:52:43] I really did.
[02:52:44] It gets to be fun after a while.
[02:52:45] You meet new people.
[02:52:47] And moreover, they ask you questions privately
[02:52:51] that you hadn't quite thought through.
[02:52:53] And after you fumble around with that, you say,
[02:52:55] I won't fumble around with that a second time.
[02:52:58] And it turns out, two days later,
[02:53:00] a guy asks you the same question.
[02:53:02] I don't understand.
[02:53:02] You're ready for it.
[02:53:04] So after that, and he spent 10 times what I spent.
[02:53:08] A US Congressman, I was told, will do anything
[02:53:13] to stay in office.
[02:53:14] Anything.
[02:53:15] So at any rate, he spent 10 times what I had to spend.
[02:53:18] I had the $35,000 to spend.
[02:53:20] He spent $350,000.
[02:53:22] But anyway, and he wouldn't debate me either.
[02:53:27] He finally went to this silly thing on,
[02:53:31] he was in DC because he couldn't quite return, which
[02:53:33] is baloney.
[02:53:35] He was from the county north of where we live.
[02:53:38] But at any rate, it wasn't going to say that.
[02:53:44] Well, it had to do with your racket that you're running,
[02:53:46] your other racket.
[02:53:48] Yeah, well, I was stockbroker at that point.
[02:53:52] Because when I had my subdural hematoma,
[02:53:56] they cut a hole in your head to take a piece out of your head.
[02:54:00] Because it slept and fought about that.
[02:54:02] But when I caught in there, you're John Glenn.
[02:54:06] John Glenn fully recovered and so have I.
[02:54:09] But a lot of people don't.
[02:54:11] I think too, it's a matter of wanting to and deciding
[02:54:17] to recover.
[02:54:18] Because with my case, my right side,
[02:54:21] it was on my left side.
[02:54:22] And it's true, your left side didn't work right.
[02:54:25] And it worked a little bit, but not real well.
[02:54:29] And I couldn't walk right and stuff like that.
[02:54:33] Anyway, so at any rate, how'd you get the registrar?
[02:54:40] I am the Pennsylvania registrar for births and deaths
[02:54:44] in only townships, 06 townships, and for several surrounding
[02:54:49] townships.
[02:54:50] If you die, you need a will.
[02:54:52] And to have a will, you need an executor who distributes.
[02:54:57] But you have to prove it.
[02:54:58] Have somebody prove it.
[02:54:59] This guy is dead, not just gone to South America, and so forth.
[02:55:03] So you make certified copies of his death certificate,
[02:55:10] issued generally by the hospital or the corner.
[02:55:14] And that way, your executor, or man or woman's executor,
[02:55:20] can probate the will and so forth and all that.
[02:55:25] So at any rate, a year after, maybe 10 months
[02:55:29] after I lost the election, I get to talk
[02:55:33] to a guy named Bob Asher, who was a little bit of a character
[02:55:37] and well-known in Pennsylvania politics,
[02:55:39] because he took the heat and went to jail for something
[02:55:42] he didn't do, but probably to protect a Pennsylvania senator
[02:55:48] or maybe one of the governors, I don't know.
[02:55:50] But he took the heat and everybody
[02:55:51] agrees that Bob never did anything.
[02:55:54] But he owns a candy company called Asher Candies.
[02:55:56] It's well-known chocolates in Eastern Pennsylvania.
[02:56:00] And there he was at this affair.
[02:56:02] So I went up to him and I said, Bob, you owe me one.
[02:56:05] He said, get out of here.
[02:56:07] I said, you know who I am?
[02:56:08] Oh, I know who you are.
[02:56:10] I said, I rang 10,000 doorbells.
[02:56:13] Yeah, I heard about that.
[02:56:15] I said, he had to spend $350,000 to beat me.
[02:56:22] Yeah.
[02:56:23] Bob, we both know what that means.
[02:56:26] He would have spent $35,000 against the guy in Fayette
[02:56:29] County, he would have spent $58,000 at the guy in Pittsburgh,
[02:56:34] he would have spent $102,000 in the guy in the Harrisburg race.
[02:56:40] He spent it all to beat me.
[02:56:43] Yeah, so what?
[02:56:45] Bob, you owe me one.
[02:56:48] A week later, the local guy that I knew very well
[02:56:51] was a whole political office called me up and he said,
[02:56:55] how'd you like to be a register of will?
[02:56:58] What in the hell is that?
[02:57:02] So I said, yeah, that's right.
[02:57:04] How much does it pay?
[02:57:06] Well, you won't make much.
[02:57:08] You can make $35,000 doing it.
[02:57:10] You can.
[02:57:12] At any rate, they're trying to get rid of the Pennsylvania
[02:57:15] Register.
[02:57:16] Now I'm just sticking on because I figured right down
[02:57:19] to the last day, so at any rate, that's how that happened.
[02:57:24] So I was a stockbroker and if you start late in life
[02:57:28] to be a stockbroker, you don't have much of an account.
[02:57:31] And stuff, and I got to be a certain age
[02:57:35] and I said to my wife, this is not cutting.
[02:57:37] I got to do something else.
[02:57:38] And right after that, my sister-in-law came to me
[02:57:42] and she was German national.
[02:57:44] You wouldn't know it.
[02:57:45] She has zero accent.
[02:57:46] She said, you sell bread that's good enough to sell in Germany.
[02:57:51] You need to do this.
[02:57:53] I'm still doing it by hand.
[02:57:54] And one thing led to another there.
[02:57:56] So that's what I do now.
[02:57:57] And I'll tell you what, keep shit in shape.
[02:58:01] You're not going to get fat doing this unless you want to.
[02:58:04] I suppose you got to make sure you don't get too much of your own product, though.
[02:58:07] That's true.
[02:58:08] Just like the drug dealers.
[02:58:10] No, no, no.
[02:58:11] I say to people, people in the store say, I don't eat much bread.
[02:58:14] I say, it's not the bread.
[02:58:16] It's what you put on it.
[02:58:18] Too much mayonnaise or too much strawberry jam
[02:58:21] is what you do with it, not the stuff.
[02:58:25] Well, what's the name, so where can people get your bread?
[02:58:29] You got a shipment.
[02:58:30] Oh, I got to.
[02:58:31] I know what I'm not going to be going to the grocery market very often in Pennsylvania.
[02:58:35] The Ole Baker.
[02:58:36] The Ole Baker.
[02:58:37] O-L-E-Y, yeah.
[02:58:39] That's an Indian name for the valley in which we live.
[02:58:42] The Indian name for it was Olinka.
[02:58:45] And that got shortened by the locals at that time way back.
[02:58:50] Benjamin Franklin did not like to come up to that county.
[02:58:54] He said there were too many Germans up there.
[02:58:56] I don't like to go up there.
[02:58:58] He was a good horseman in his middle age.
[02:59:01] We all see Ben Franklin as a big fat old guy.
[02:59:04] Oh, yeah.
[02:59:05] Fat old man.
[02:59:06] But he was an expert, expert horseman.
[02:59:10] People did not like to travel with him.
[02:59:13] I read an account of him going to York, PA, which is west of Harrisburg.
[02:59:20] I didn't like that with him because he would take off over land to basically explore the
[02:59:25] landscape and whatnot.
[02:59:27] And they were all afraid he was going to either fall off or get killed by the locals,
[02:59:32] the Indians.
[02:59:33] So they thought, and then we're going to have to go look for him and find him.
[02:59:38] Some of the folks out there don't like us very much and so forth.
[02:59:42] So people did not like to go traveling with him.
[02:59:44] But he was an expert and overland horseman.
[02:59:48] We all see him as the fat old guy.
[02:59:50] Yeah, that's the image he got stuck with at some point.
[02:59:54] I know you wrap up your bio that you sent to Dave and it says 2022 still having fun.
[03:00:01] Heck yeah.
[03:00:02] So that's pretty awesome.
[03:00:03] I don't know.
[03:00:04] Did we miss anything?
[03:00:07] Get us up to date?
[03:00:08] There's one thing I thought about it on going by now it escapes me.
[03:00:14] Same marriage.
[03:00:15] Marriage is the same woman.
[03:00:16] And just during the political campaign they would ask you, still married to the same woman
[03:00:23] since age 27.
[03:00:26] Wow.
[03:00:27] So you got married a little bit late.
[03:00:29] And it was your daughter that brought you here and then linked us up.
[03:00:32] I think she linked us up on social media.
[03:00:34] Yeah, it was my elder daughter, Genevieve.
[03:00:37] And she wanted to come with me but she is in a job that she doesn't like and she's
[03:00:43] intensely searching.
[03:00:45] So the other daughter said, I'll take him out and she had not actually said, she said,
[03:00:50] if you go, I'll buy it my own ticket.
[03:00:53] Oh good.
[03:00:54] So then I said to you, I will not travel alone.
[03:00:58] I will travel with my wife.
[03:01:00] Okay.
[03:01:02] So then Pamela said, I don't want to go.
[03:01:05] We have an ancient puppy dog here and she's going to die.
[03:01:08] So we ought to euthanize her.
[03:01:10] I can't do that.
[03:01:12] That's the pragmatic solution apparently.
[03:01:16] So younger daughter said, I'll go with him.
[03:01:19] So she is here today in San Diego.
[03:01:23] And elder daughter is angry.
[03:01:27] But I said, Jenny, what you're doing is more important.
[03:01:31] And she's working it.
[03:01:34] She got into the medical world, most specifically into transplants.
[03:01:40] And she said, if Jaco says anything to you, ask him if he is an organ donor.
[03:01:47] And he said, of course he should be.
[03:01:50] Everybody should be.
[03:01:51] I am.
[03:01:52] Yeah.
[03:01:53] I'll tell her that.
[03:01:54] But anyway.
[03:01:55] She's going to know.
[03:01:56] Apparently everyone's going to know now.
[03:01:57] I said, but the thing about Jenny, the thing that people want is something you can do
[03:02:01] that most people can't.
[03:02:03] You can keep six balls in the air at the same time, so to speak.
[03:02:07] That's why these guys in the transplant business love you so much because they could say, oh,
[03:02:12] I don't know about that.
[03:02:14] Ask Jenny.
[03:02:15] And she had the answer.
[03:02:16] Or this computer thing is screwed up and it's off the thing and it won't work.
[03:02:22] And so call Jenny.
[03:02:23] She can do that.
[03:02:24] And she does.
[03:02:25] There you go.
[03:02:26] So the younger daughter, they have their, she and her husband have their own business.
[03:02:30] So it's easily done for them.
[03:02:33] Although they're very serious and they do well.
[03:02:37] That's the whole thing there.
[03:02:39] There's something else.
[03:02:40] Dave, what do you got?
[03:02:43] I got a lot.
[03:02:45] Oh, I know we're kind of running.
[03:02:48] I've been taking a lot of notes.
[03:02:50] Um, it just, I'm remarketing how many similarities there are.
[03:02:56] And I just started writing things down.
[03:02:57] I was stationed at Meridian.
[03:02:59] I was stationed at Kingsville.
[03:03:02] I was in LSO.
[03:03:03] I have about 40 traps in the Connie early in my career.
[03:03:05] How about that?
[03:03:07] Yeah.
[03:03:08] I, uh, I did the spin rides in the T2 and I knew her spin instructor.
[03:03:11] I know that well.
[03:03:12] It's fine.
[03:03:13] It's a great, I said, one of those things.
[03:03:14] I said, it's great carnival ride.
[03:03:16] He's a good carnival ride.
[03:03:17] But so many guys would not do it.
[03:03:18] And I used to say that the student didn't know who I was.
[03:03:21] I'll, I'll be doing your spin hop today.
[03:03:25] You're terrified.
[03:03:26] Well, no, Mr. Copel, but I thought that, I said, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[03:03:29] How many guys have you punched out on spin hops?
[03:03:32] Oh, I don't know.
[03:03:35] No one.
[03:03:36] It's a carnival ride and so forth.
[03:03:41] And Fred didn't want to, I, that gives me, I don't like to do that.
[03:03:44] I'll do them.
[03:03:45] I'll do them for you.
[03:03:46] So I would do a lot of spin hops in Meridian.
[03:03:48] It's a carnival ride.
[03:03:51] Not much instruction goes on that day except for the route.
[03:03:54] All right, Mr. Smith, we established the direction of rotation and we will positively
[03:04:01] neutralize the controls and then apply full opposite rudder.
[03:04:07] And when the rotation stops, we will stick full forward and so forth.
[03:04:14] Yeah, that's all you do.
[03:04:15] And then, okay, fine.
[03:04:17] We got that.
[03:04:18] Now we're going to climb back up.
[03:04:19] You have to do it again.
[03:04:20] Yeah, I'm going to do it again too.
[03:04:24] I remember it well.
[03:04:25] It's one of the best rides ever.
[03:04:29] My time with the Air Force and then you kind of conclude with a couple of things that just
[03:04:33] could help make the connection to living on the O3 level in the state room underneath
[03:04:37] the catapults.
[03:04:38] And then, God forbid, I am on a podcast where I don't have to say something nice about Navy
[03:04:45] Seals, but you work for a frogman and got to see what real good leadership looked like.
[03:04:52] But you know what?
[03:04:53] He, let's talk about leadership just a second.
[03:04:56] He was not well thought of, mostly by the younger guys who are ROs in the fleet squad
[03:05:02] or not was in.
[03:05:03] He never does anything.
[03:05:04] He would talk and they would say not nice things about him.
[03:05:09] I don't think any of the front seat guys said that.
[03:05:11] What a surprise.
[03:05:13] But the back seat guys, they're all young and Lieutenant Junior Grades, all of them
[03:05:20] solid.
[03:05:21] And most of them retired as commanders.
[03:05:22] I don't know what the heck they got them to do to say in the Navy that long, but at
[03:05:27] any rate, they didn't like him because they couldn't understand what he was doing.
[03:05:31] I think the front seat guys all really understood what was going on there.
[03:05:35] Well, I think there's a real strong connection between pilots and Seals.
[03:05:39] I got to learn that firsthand working with Jaco.
[03:05:41] But you did it at a time where you didn't have the machines that we had.
[03:05:47] I mean, you flew an airplane that I guarantee you was infinitely harder than it was for
[03:05:51] me.
[03:05:52] But it occurred to me that the legacy that I got to live under the 35 years of history
[03:05:59] was written about people like you.
[03:06:01] When I got in the Navy, the Marine Corps, how we flew fighters and the way we taught
[03:06:06] people to fly fighters was already embedded.
[03:06:10] And that all started with your generation.
[03:06:12] But that's what I was thinking about in that.
[03:06:15] Dan Patterson and the book.
[03:06:18] That wasn't called Top Gun until maybe, I don't know, three, four, five years later.
[03:06:25] Somebody said Top Gun.
[03:06:26] But the F-4 didn't have a gun.
[03:06:28] And I don't, and all your newspaper guys, they say, I had to have a gun.
[03:06:32] And then finally did the F-4E and had a gun.
[03:06:35] And then finally, no, the missile was a better weapon every time, every time.
[03:06:40] You had to be within 3,000 feet to do anything with a 20-millimeter gun.
[03:06:44] I shot the gun at Kingsville.
[03:06:46] We all did, I was bad at it too.
[03:06:48] I don't know.
[03:06:51] They put your colored paint on your, and then they examined the banner.
[03:06:57] There are no greens on here.
[03:06:59] What happened to you, Tom?
[03:07:00] And embarrassing, you know?
[03:07:03] I'm an older guy.
[03:07:04] I'm supposed to have holes in there.
[03:07:06] But at any rate, I don't, I utterly disagree with that business about if any sort of a
[03:07:13] fire plane had to have a gun, a ball of the lone.
[03:07:16] Now early on, sparrows didn't work because White Hat Sailors would drop them and chuck
[03:07:22] them up into the bottom of the airplane.
[03:07:24] And they didn't test them to make sure this is working and things like that.
[03:07:29] And then the aviators didn't turn the panel on and to see if the missiles, they called
[03:07:33] it toony, that the missiles would tune and things like that.
[03:07:38] And then if one didn't tune, you could flip past that to go to the number two.
[03:07:43] And so forth.
[03:07:44] And fire that one.
[03:07:45] Forget about the first one.
[03:07:46] But then you could do one more thing that came out during Top Gun that nobody, during
[03:07:53] Advanced Fighter Weapons School, if you went to Borsight, tell the guy in back, cock me,
[03:07:59] go to Borsight.
[03:08:01] The antenna goes where the pepper is, through the 35-mil gun sight is looking.
[03:08:07] They're both looking at the same place.
[03:08:09] And that's what I was going to do with the 21.
[03:08:11] Go Borsight, pull the trigger.
[03:08:13] And you get a sparrow, which is a monster missile that weighs 500 pounds.
[03:08:19] A sparrow.
[03:08:20] The ones we had anyway, the E-Models weighed 500 pounds.
[03:08:25] But anyway, it wasn't called Fighter Weapons School back then.
[03:08:30] Oh yeah.
[03:08:31] So the thing you read in Dan Pedersen's book, who remains a nice guy.
[03:08:38] But I would say this to him in a clear way, most of the airplanes shot down in World War
[03:08:44] I, in World War II, in Korean War, in the Vietnam War, never saw the guy that shot them
[03:08:53] down.
[03:08:54] They never saw the missile that shot them down.
[03:08:56] I know, I knew, guys who came out feet wet out of North Vietnam and saw the missile go
[03:09:06] by.
[03:09:07] The B-Model missiles, the missile the Russians had, they stole it from us and shipped it
[03:09:12] through Berlin on commercial freight.
[03:09:16] And it didn't guide that well.
[03:09:18] At least the Russian version of it didn't.
[03:09:20] It had a big seeker head on it and it didn't narrow its sight.
[03:09:25] But I talked with guys who said, I saw the missile go by and I had no idea.
[03:09:31] Holy smoke.
[03:09:35] These guys who got shot down, and I heard this early in the cruise, not until I was
[03:09:42] out there and you get fully realized that they're used real bullets here and stuff.
[03:09:49] Most 95% of the airplanes that got shot down, get shot down and they never saw the guy,
[03:09:58] whatever did it to them.
[03:09:59] They never saw it.
[03:10:01] One time we were in Laos somewhere, it doesn't matter where, waiting for the fact.
[03:10:07] And he's at 14 on the 15.
[03:10:10] He's in a port orbit and I'm in a starboard orbit.
[03:10:14] We're just waiting quietly.
[03:10:17] And here comes an F-4.
[03:10:21] You can tell because it has at the wing roots and the leading edge, it has two flashing white
[03:10:27] lights.
[03:10:28] That's an F-4 and he comes flying by and he gets about where we are.
[03:10:35] That's where there are guns on the ground because that's where there are truck parking
[03:10:38] and that's where the fact is going to meet us.
[03:10:40] And those gunners can hear us up overhead.
[03:10:44] But here comes this guy over the horizon, an F-4.
[03:10:50] That's this guy, probably 57 at least, maybe 85mm and he's still got his lights on bright
[03:10:58] and flash.
[03:11:00] And he disappeared over the horizon, bright and flash.
[03:11:04] Did you get close to him?
[03:11:05] I'm not that close because they were shooting at him but I went close enough.
[03:11:09] I can see that.
[03:11:10] It's an Air Force F-4.
[03:11:12] Not some Navy guy who's lost or something.
[03:11:16] It's Air Force F-4.
[03:11:20] And he never knew it.
[03:11:22] Oblivious to everything with his lights on bright and flash.
[03:11:26] That's a true story.
[03:11:27] So my point here is that Top Gun is, or what they call now Top Gun, is very interesting
[03:11:34] if you go one on one.
[03:11:35] You both start from here, you turn and start with a head on pass and so forth.
[03:11:40] One guy is better than the other and he gets behind the other.
[03:11:43] But that's not what happens.
[03:11:45] What happens is the guy that you were picking your nose for some reason or other and the
[03:11:51] MiG-21 showed up or a MiG-26 or God knows what it is and he shot you down from three
[03:11:56] miles a stern because you were picking your nose.
[03:12:00] You got to be a wild man in that cockpit if you don't want to get shot down.
[03:12:04] You got to know everything that's going on, 360 degrees all the time.
[03:12:09] So you turn into a crazy man and you fly with a new RO.
[03:12:13] He said, you're really nuts.
[03:12:15] I'm still here too.
[03:12:17] That's all I got, man.
[03:12:20] So at any rate, I beg your pardon, I interrupted you.
[03:12:22] Not at all.
[03:12:23] That's probably a great place to wrap it up right there.
[03:12:26] All right.
[03:12:27] That's a great attitude to have.
[03:12:30] Thank you so much for coming out here.
[03:12:32] It was fun.
[03:12:33] Really appreciate it.
[03:12:34] It was very young.
[03:12:35] Thanks for sharing your experiences, lessons learned and of course, most important, thank
[03:12:41] you for your service.
[03:12:42] Oh, bologna.
[03:12:43] So, to your show.
[03:12:44] Thank you for being in the Air Force and your service in the Navy.
[03:12:48] And most of all, thank you for your service to our great nation.
[03:12:51] Amen.
[03:12:52] Thank you, sir.
[03:12:55] And with that, Tom Copel has left the building.
[03:13:01] Pretty awesome to hear from a dude that, as you were telling me before we hit record,
[03:13:09] in the middle of the Vietnam War, just volunteers to go and fly, you know, F4 Phantoms.
[03:13:17] That's the pipeline too.
[03:13:19] So pretty amazing to hear these guys.
[03:13:21] I thought it was actually pretty interesting about the nuclear war stuff too.
[03:13:25] Yeah.
[03:13:26] You know, like, what, what, what are you thinking?
[03:13:30] What you, you know, I was in the SEAL teams and I was like, Hey, we might do a mission.
[03:13:34] In the 90s, like, Hey, we might do a mission Michael, you know, kill a terrorist.
[03:13:39] This dude's like, Hey, we might go and end humanity.
[03:13:42] Yeah.
[03:13:43] You know, that's a, I remember when I first started flying airplanes, what you really
[03:13:48] want to do is you actually want to, you want to do something.
[03:13:51] You want to drop a bomb, you want to get in a fight.
[03:13:53] That's what you want to do.
[03:13:55] And there's a double edge to that.
[03:13:56] Because you know, like, well, I mean, we don't want to go to war.
[03:13:59] It's not a good thing.
[03:14:00] But if you do, you like, you want to get the call.
[03:14:03] The only thing you're ever going to do when you're, you know, strategic air command with
[03:14:07] nuclear weapons at a B 52, you get that call.
[03:14:09] Like that's a different psychology about what your job is.
[03:14:13] You know, and I could see someone like him getting pretty restless doing strip alert
[03:14:17] all day, knowing it's kind of unlikely.
[03:14:21] And if it did work out, like, what are you actually doing there?
[03:14:24] That's not a scenario you want to be in, no matter what.
[03:14:26] So yeah.
[03:14:27] Crazy.
[03:14:28] But anyways, thanks for listening.
[03:14:31] If you want to support the podcast, you want to support yourself, get yourself some jocwafield.com.

[03:14:49] We got ready to drink milk now.
[03:14:51] People are kind of going crazy with that stuff.
[03:14:54] I'll tell you what's what I find.
[03:14:57] I look just like every other freaking American, the convenience of just cracking one of those
[03:15:05] open and drinking it.
[03:15:07] Look, how much effort is it for me to get out my, get out my milk, get out my shaker,
[03:15:13] put my mulk in there, shake it, you know, that has to take me at least three minutes.
[03:15:20] Or I got that little ready to drink hitter just ready to, you know, take some.
[03:15:25] The other thing I find about it is you can just do, you can, it's so effortless that
[03:15:29] you can just open one up.
[03:15:30] Like I have, I have a part of my fridge where I have one of each kind of opened where I'll
[03:15:35] just go like take a sip, take maybe two or three sips, you know, just during the day,
[03:15:39] just to fly by.
[03:15:41] So there you go.
[03:15:44] Mulk, all the joint stuff, you know what, you know what it is.
[03:15:48] You can get it, jocwafield.com.
[03:15:50] You can get it at the Wawa, get the drinks at Wawa, get it vitamin shop.
[03:15:54] You'll get some support.
[03:15:55] Origin USA.
[03:15:56] I saw Cam Haynes today posted, Cam is teaching Tulsi Gabbard how to shoot a bow and they're
[03:16:06] wearing origin hunt.
[03:16:08] How legit is that?
[03:16:09] Pretty awesome.
[03:16:10] So check out origin USA.com.
[03:16:12] We're making stuff in America.

[03:16:24] So, get some of that.
[03:16:27] We got a store.
[03:16:29] Echo called it Joclostore.
[03:16:31] It's joclostore.com.
[03:16:33] Get t-shirts.
[03:16:34] Where you wearing?
[03:16:35] Oh, that's a legit one.
[03:16:36] So Dave, right now if you're not on YouTube, Dave's wearing the Seawolves t-shirts, 1966
[03:16:41] to 1972.
[03:16:42] The only aviation unit ever commissioned and decommissioned in a combat zone.
[03:16:50] We've had some Seawolves on the podcast.
[03:16:52] There's a t-shirt to represent the Seawolves.
[03:16:56] You can get that at joclostore.com.
[03:16:59] We also got rash guards and hats and beanies and all that kind of stuff.
[03:17:03] The shirt locker.
[03:17:06] Shirt lockers, it's a little opportunity for us to express kind of, let's say some deep
[03:17:17] layers to the podcast.
[03:17:20] And it's a subscription thing, get a shirt a month and they're cool.
[03:17:24] We got this podcast, subscribe to it.
[03:17:25] Jockel Underground.
[03:17:26] We're doing the Underground podcast, which is also a platform that we have that we control.
[03:17:33] Because if you're not in control of a platform, you should be nervous that they could kick
[03:17:39] you off that platform.
[03:17:40] So I was nervous about that.
[03:17:42] Now, look, I'm not trying to get kicked off.
[03:17:43] I don't think I'm gonna get kicked off.
[03:17:45] We're not getting crazy over here.
[03:17:48] But there's certain things I've said that have been demonetized.
[03:17:55] So who knows when they're gonna say, yeah, you can't say that anymore.
[03:17:59] So we have our own platform, jockelunderground.com.
[03:18:01] Check that out, YouTube channel.
[03:18:06] Jockel podcast is the YouTube channel.
[03:18:09] OriginUSA also has a YouTube channel.
[03:18:11] We got psychological warfare.
[03:18:12] We got flip side canvas, Dakota Meyer.
[03:18:15] Got a bunch of books, Only Cry for the Living by Holly McKay.
[03:18:21] Final spin.
[03:18:22] The audiobook of Final Spin, Dave and I did like a Q&A from Final Spin.
[03:18:27] So after the book, you can do the Q&A.
[03:18:28] You can listen to that Q&A.
[03:18:30] Pretty cool.
[03:18:32] The background of where it came from.
[03:18:35] I can tell you where it's going.
[03:18:37] That thing's making moves.
[03:18:39] I'll leave it at that for now, because it's hard to get these things done.
[03:18:41] Anyways, I've written a bunch of books, Warrior Kid books.
[03:18:48] Just of I have a gym, Victory MMA and Fitness.
[03:18:51] Just about every day a parent will come up to me and say, thank you for those books.
[03:18:56] That got my kid to focus in school.
[03:18:58] Got my kid here to start training, got my kid to stop eating junk.
[03:19:03] So check out those books for your kids.
[03:19:06] Way of the Warrior Kid series.
[03:19:09] Mikey and the Dragons, Hackworth, About Face, Extreme Ownership, Dicotomy, Leadership,
[03:19:15] all these books.

[03:19:18] Ashland Front.
[03:19:19] What's Ashland Front, Dave Burke?
[03:19:20] Ashland Front is our leadership consultancy, where we, you, me, Leif and the whole team
[03:19:27] get to actually in person, live talk about every single leadership principle you've been
[03:19:31] talking about on this podcast and in the book.
[03:19:33] We get to do it with companies and people all the time.
[03:19:37] It's awesome.
[03:19:38] And what about the Academy?
[03:19:39] Oh, the Academy.
[03:19:40] The Extreme Ownership Academy.
[03:19:41] It turns out that meeting people live and in person isn't always the most convenient
[03:19:46] way to do it and bringing people off the line or bringing people into a conference room
[03:19:50] or a classroom every single day is not a great way to train.
[03:19:53] We want to keep people working.
[03:19:54] But the Academy takes basically everything we teach, puts it online so you can get to
[03:19:58] it whenever and however you want to.
[03:20:01] And it's an awesome additional resource.
[03:20:03] It's basically being able to hit that leadership gym every day whenever it's convenient for
[03:20:07] you.
[03:20:08] Yeah.
[03:20:09] Just like Jiu Jitsu, there's moves you got to learn.
[03:20:12] There's moves you've got to learn about leadership.
[03:20:15] And just like Jiu Jitsu, you can't just look at a move and hear it one time and be like,
[03:20:19] oh, I'll throw this, oh, my plot on somebody now.
[03:20:21] This is not going to work.
[03:20:23] You got to fully understand it.
[03:20:25] You got to see it from different angles.
[03:20:26] You got to try it yourself.
[03:20:27] And that's what the Academy is, extremeownership.com.
[03:20:31] If you want to get in on that and if you want to help service members active and retired,
[03:20:36] you want to help their families, you want to help Gold Star families, check out Mark
[03:20:41] Lee's mom, mom of each.
[03:20:42] She's got a charity organization, does incredible stuff, does incredible stuff, takes service
[03:20:48] members.
[03:20:49] This is one of the things that she does.
[03:20:51] She takes service members who have significant health issues and she gets them treatment.
[03:20:57] It's a multifaceted treatment.
[03:20:59] One of the big treatments is hyperbaric chambers.
[03:21:01] You're going in, ride in the O2.
[03:21:05] She sets this up for like 30 or 45 days, all expenses paid.
[03:21:11] We've seen the results of this is just outstanding.

[03:21:46] Thanks once again to Tom Copel for making the trip out, for sharing those experiences
[03:21:52] and lessons learned from your life.
[03:21:56] Pretty neat to hear this stuff first person.
[03:22:00] Thanks for your service.
[03:22:02] Thanks for coming out.
[03:22:03] And thanks to all our military personnel with special recognition today to those of you
[03:22:10] that help us own the skies, the pilots, the navigators, the air crews, the maintenance
[03:22:15] and mechanics on the ground and the thousands of support people that make our domination
[03:22:21] of the air possible.
[03:22:23] Thank you for what you all do.
[03:22:26] Thanks as well to our police, law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,
[03:22:32] correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all first responders.
[03:22:36] Thanks for what you do here on the home front to keep us safe.
[03:22:42] And I want to close this out with another quote, a quote from Captain David McCamble,
[03:22:51] United States Navy.
[03:22:53] 34 air victories in World War II, the most of any US Navy pilot ever.
[03:23:01] And he said this quote, aggressiveness was a fundamental to success in air to air combat.
[03:23:09] And if you ever caught a fighter pilot in a defensive mood, you had him licked before
[03:23:15] you started shooting.
[03:23:18] End quote.
[03:23:20] So there you go.
[03:23:22] That just doesn't apply to air to air combat.
[03:23:24] It applies to everything.
[03:23:26] That's how you win.
[03:23:28] So get out there, be aggressive, make things happen.
[03:23:33] And of course, keep getting after it.
[03:23:37] And until next time, this is Dave N'Jocko.
[03:23:41] Out.
