[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 357 with Echo Charles and me,
[00:00:04] Jocko Willink. Good evening Echo. Good evening.
[00:00:07] Sims kept moving and I stopped him by shouting to his back.
[00:00:14] Sir, anything you asked me to do, I am here. You know that.
[00:00:19] Sims stopped slowly pivoting on the P-stone. He walked back to me.
[00:00:27] I know that, Staff Sergeant Bell. I've never once questioned that in you.
[00:00:33] I took a moment. It was a cool night. The silence of this area of open nothingness was now invaded by
[00:00:44] giant generators humming, blasting lights brighter than a Texas high school football stadium.
[00:00:50] An area that was essentially a path that required night vision two weeks ago was now amassed with
[00:00:55] army heavy equipment, trucks, cranes and con-ex trailers of worker B contractors and soldiers
[00:01:01] endlessly moving equipment 24 hours a day for the big inter-theater move to Fallujah.
[00:01:09] What do you got Sergeant? I am more worried about losing people now than losing people in 10 years.
[00:01:17] And I don't mean to disrespect where you were coming from. I just can't think that way.
[00:01:26] We are going to lose people. We will lose some of these men.
[00:01:34] The reality of what he just said seemed to impact him in real time as if he was unaware of what was coming out of his own mouth.
[00:01:43] He paused. Sergeant, I don't know if I'm prepared for that either.
[00:01:49] We both looked at each other. All I wanted was the Fallujah fight. I dreamed for this test.
[00:01:56] I was so excited about the prospects of actually impacting this war.
[00:02:01] Now with Captain Sims, the reality of it seemed to hit me at once.
[00:02:08] He looked at me. Bags under his eyes. Stress. Worry. His wet eyes seemed red from long hours and late nights.
[00:02:21] No way around this. I need you. This is going to be really rough, he said.
[00:02:28] We need you, sir. You got us here and you will get us home.
[00:02:34] Let's get as many back home as we can. Yes, sir.
[00:02:41] We walked in two opposite directions that night. Captain Sims toward the glowing lights, me into the pitch blackness of the barracks.
[00:02:54] When I think of Captain Sean Sims, I see him in his DCUs, bright in that night's glow of the light.
[00:03:03] With only a helmet on his head and a sidearm on his leg. Walking into the light.
[00:03:16] And that right there is an excerpt from a book called Remember the Ramrods.
[00:03:24] An Army Brotherhood in War and Peace by David Belavia.
[00:03:30] And that's a conversation that took place just prior to the second battle of Fallujah.
[00:03:37] Operation Phantom Fury. The bloodiest battle of the Iraq War.
[00:03:43] And the heaviest concentration of urban combat since the Vietnam War.
[00:03:49] Captain Sims was the commander of Alpha Company.
[00:03:53] Second battalion, second infantry regiment known as the Ramrods.
[00:03:57] Who were organized in the third brigade combat team. First infantry division.
[00:04:04] David Belavia was a squad leader in Third Platoon of Alpha Company.
[00:04:12] And so that was a conversation between an officer, the officer, the company commander.
[00:04:18] And one of his non-commissioned officers as they prepared for the worst combat that they could imagine.
[00:04:27] In a short time after that conversation, they crossed the breach into Fallujah.
[00:04:35] Where they met the enemy and proved their medal as soldiers, as warriors, and as American fighting men.
[00:04:47] And there was great sacrifice during that battle.
[00:04:51] Including over 500 wounded Americans. 95 killed.
[00:04:58] And for his actions during one house fight in that battle, David Belavia was awarded the Medal of Honor.
[00:05:06] And he has written about his experiences in two books. The first book called House to House.
[00:05:13] And a new book that just came out that I mentioned which is called Remember the Ramrods.
[00:05:20] And it's an honor to have David Belavia here with us tonight to share his experiences and his lessons learned.
[00:05:29] David, thanks for coming out man. Thanks for having me. Appreciate it.
[00:05:34] That reading that section of the book, I remember when we were getting relieved in Ramadi.
[00:05:41] My task unit was getting relieved in Ramadi. And the new task unit came to take our place.
[00:05:46] And we're giving them an in-brief. And the guys that were relieving us, well,
[00:05:54] they were coming from San Diego, California, SEAL Team 5. And I remember giving them a brief
[00:06:02] and I was telling them, you are going to take casualties. And you could see, even though these
[00:06:08] guys, these guys had been to Mark Lee's funeral, they'd been to Mikey Montsource funeral a couple
[00:06:13] weeks prior. But, you know, they got on the ground and there's me and I'm telling them, hey,
[00:06:23] you guys are going to take casualties. It's a rough thing to face. And that conversation that
[00:06:30] you had with Captain Sims, you know, and look, how old were you at that time? I was 28. 28 years old.
[00:06:38] And you have that attitude like, hey, this is what this is what I was born to do. This is what I've
[00:06:43] been waiting for. I want to go fight inclusion. These guys from Team 5, God bless them, what
[00:06:48] they want to do. They wanted to get into it, of course. And that reality check of, hey, this is
[00:06:55] where it's going. And this is war. And casualties are going to come. It's a, it's a heavy,
[00:07:02] it's a heavy thing to walk into. I mean, Harry, you read that.
[00:07:11] I, it's, it's so, it's, it's strange to me because I think of, you know, the guys that get hurt
[00:07:19] are the ones that really know what you can get shot at repeatedly. A snap, a hiss. I mean,
[00:07:27] you're first in country. You always laugh at the new guy. Doesn't know the difference between
[00:07:31] incoming outgoing, like, hey, what are you doing? Running for the bunker, right? It's like, when a
[00:07:38] baby's born, the pacifier falls and you sterilize and steam it, autoclave it, you know, then after
[00:07:44] like the second, third kid, you're like, who, you know, come on, put some more dirt on it. It's good
[00:07:49] for his immune system. The reality is that once you have been shot and you know, and you see your
[00:07:56] friends that have experienced it, there's, it's not real until that happens. And we, remember
[00:08:05] the Ramrods is a book about how we all are trying to, I used to think that I missed war
[00:08:14] and that for my entire remaining adult years after I left the military, I missed, I missed
[00:08:21] adrenaline. I missed, they ultimate, I mean, you go into a job interview and it's like,
[00:08:27] are you good enough? What's on your resume? You know, what degree do you have your credit score?
[00:08:35] In civilian life, we, we, we like before we trust. You go on a date. Are you worthy of my time? Do I
[00:08:43] trust you? In the military, I trusted before I still don't like half these guys, you know,
[00:08:49] but I trust them, you know, like it's a totally different. And so we look at those days and we
[00:08:56] think that was the best time of my life. And there's also, we know that's weird for civilians to hear,
[00:09:04] right? We know that that's odd. And I thought those were the best days of my life. And I realized
[00:09:11] it wasn't the war. It was the relationships. It was the people. It was the sense of validation
[00:09:17] and purpose. Every day I woke up, I knew what I had to do. I knew I was needed. And being needed
[00:09:25] in a fight is the great, leading men is an incredible honor. But having a purpose in a fight
[00:09:33] is the greatest experience ever. When you're being shot at, and it's almost like the enemy's
[00:09:39] only shooting at the guys they want to take out of the battlefield. You don't ever want to be in
[00:09:43] a fight and not getting shot at. That means they're, they're willing to keep you out there for a
[00:09:47] little while. You're not, you're not exactly a threat to anyone. That's a, it's a great feeling
[00:09:54] to know that this, my generation, every reason people are divided today, our generation at war
[00:10:03] had all the problems people have today. We had gay people. We had people of different ethnicity,
[00:10:09] different religions. And yet we cancel each other's vote out every year. So we've gotten
[00:10:17] the same debates. And then when the bell rang, we went out there, did our job, and, and, and learned
[00:10:25] to live with each other and respect each other and love each other. And that to me is something that
[00:10:31] we, everyone talk, well, it's missing. It's our responsibility to remind our citizens why we fight.
[00:10:40] There's not a dental plan in the world that's going to make you do what you did. I mean, honestly,
[00:10:44] seriously, is it college debt, college debt's that bad that you're going to go and do a vacation in
[00:10:50] Ramadi? I mean, it's ridiculous. It's absurd to say. So do you grieve? You know, you have,
[00:10:58] have, have been able to do something with your career that to me is, I'm tired of people saying,
[00:11:07] look what he did. I want people to say, look what I can do. If it's not inspiring to see people like
[00:11:14] you, then it's a waste. Because if it's just about one individual, and that's why this award is so,
[00:11:20] this award is ridiculous. Because what do you do? We're team. It's all about us. But however,
[00:11:26] there's one guy, you know what I mean? The only award for the entire living, for the entire war.
[00:11:33] It's not an honor. It's, it's, it's disrespectful. I could, I can name you seven names from
[00:11:40] Fallujah alone that should have the Medal of Honor. So, so now you put one award on someone.
[00:11:47] What is, are we going to go and just eat shrimp for the rest of our life? Is now the time to go and,
[00:11:53] you know, go off into A&E and start a TLC show? My Medal of Honor life, you know, what, what am I
[00:12:02] supposed to do with this? Get a, no, how about we remember who we are every single day? I'm, I'm
[00:12:10] still a soldier. I'm still an infantryman. I will always be a non-commissioned officer. And I'm,
[00:12:16] an example of my leadership. And, and the greatest compliment a leader can have is when his subordinates
[00:12:24] eclipse him. And that's tough for, that's tough for a guy in his 20s running around with people
[00:12:31] to understand this about the military. But we get a lot of guys that were Division I studs
[00:12:37] that brought a gun to football practice. We get a lot of guys that screwed up. And, and these are,
[00:12:43] these are guys that could be playing on Sunday. Any sport they want. There are times that you
[00:12:50] want a professional gold tend a little bit and be like, well, that's a hard charger. He's smart
[00:12:56] and he's physically fit. I got to destroy, destroy his career. He's gonna take my job. I don't want to
[00:13:01] give him a good report, a good counseling statement. I want to give him an award. And then you start
[00:13:07] to realize that the reason why our military is elite is because every generation is better than
[00:13:13] the previous. And, and you have to embrace that greatness. That's what a leader is. A leader is
[00:13:18] saying, this is what I did. Look at what my 12 guys did. They're better men. They're better
[00:13:24] fathers. They're better citizens. And they're better soldiers than I was. That's what you want
[00:13:30] to be able to say. And until you say that, you know, you're, you're playing paintball
[00:13:37] with it, with it, with the college fund. It's not real. This is what it's all about is making,
[00:13:42] is making it better for the next group. I think there's a lot in these books that
[00:13:47] definitely are going to help a lot of people to be able to move through these things.
[00:13:51] Let's get into where you came from a little bit. Just a little bit of background on you. So you're
[00:13:56] born, born in what, 1975? Yeah. And up in Western New York. How do you say your town name? Lindenville?
[00:14:06] Lindenville, yes. Population 838. Is that right? That's, yes. I was like 2010 census.
[00:14:15] We're not going to get an arena football franchise anytime soon, but it's a real small town,
[00:14:19] Appletown right off farming community off of Lake Ontario. And it's about an hour from Buffalo.
[00:14:27] And your dad, what'd your dad do? Dentist. Father was a dentist and he chose rural instead of
[00:14:35] suburban. He could have done anything, practiced anywhere. That's where he wanted to raise his
[00:14:40] family. And what about your mom? She was working at the practice. She would stay at home, helped
[00:14:46] them out, was a partner all throughout. Great family, great youngest of four. And everyone
[00:14:54] had, has a master's, double master's, PhD. I mean, these are, my dad was all about education,
[00:15:01] be a professional. How'd that work out for you? I'll tell you what, it was weird that he, as a
[00:15:08] dentist, his whole thing was, you know, he had great empathy, wanted to always take people out of
[00:15:12] pain. And I would hang out. My granddad was a, it's still alive. He's 102. And he was a Normandy
[00:15:19] vet. He did Sicily, North Africa and Normandy. And let's get him on the podcast, by the way.
[00:15:25] I'll tell you what, that'll be a 12-hour, he won't shut up. You got to just give him Olive Garden.
[00:15:30] And he'll just keep talking. He'll go, but, but my grandfather would, would, my mom, it's my mom's dad,
[00:15:37] and he had, she had like 13 brothers and sisters. And I would get these stories at an age that you
[00:15:45] probably shouldn't be telling. I remember there was a time I went target shooting when my dad had
[00:15:51] a.22 rifle. And I was, he was like, David, your grouping is good, but let's try to get it center.
[00:15:57] And I'm like, because it was low right. And he was like, why are you shooting, you know, let's get it
[00:16:02] in the middle. And I'm like, but that's where the, for moral artery is. It's by the hip bone. And granddad
[00:16:08] says, he was like, listen, no more stories about where the bleeders are. You know, that's not what
[00:16:14] we want. But, but he would tell me these stories of, of combat that were almost, they were filtered.
[00:16:21] They were Victorian in the sense that there was no better nobility. But there was always this
[00:16:27] contrast of don't ever think the enemy is just Nazis are horrible, imperial Japanese were the
[00:16:36] worst people in the world, but they're human beings. And there's something that happens to you
[00:16:42] when you go to war, that you'll never, ever look at life the same. But it wasn't as if it was a
[00:16:49] warning of don't do this. It was you can't ever appreciate anything unless you're in that environment
[00:16:57] with other people doing something together against evil. So, you know, when I went to Kosovo and
[00:17:05] K4 Bravo, no offense to the Clinton administration, I didn't really find evil. You know, we didn't
[00:17:13] we didn't interrupt, you know, ethnic cleansing. We found the ethnic cleansing. We weren't a kinetic
[00:17:20] force standing up against Milosevic or the, you know, the Greek Orthodox against the ethnic
[00:17:26] Albanians. It was just kind of like we're here. We're just hanging out. Iraq was, you know, again,
[00:17:33] it was I saw evil. I saw it. I saw people that wanted to hurt myself, my friends.
[00:17:40] It's a, you know, you can be victimized by that trauma or you can be empowered by it. And you
[00:17:48] could say, listen, there can't be a bad day ever after that. Right? I mean, there can't be. There's
[00:17:55] nothing you can't do. So your grandfather made that impression on you at a pretty young age?
[00:18:00] It would. The stories were ridiculous. He's like, I'm sleeping, you know, cold day and bestown. And
[00:18:07] it was a dead pig, a frozen pig. And he would tell these stories of how he would go into these
[00:18:13] French areas that were friendly to the Nazis. And he's like, my guys haven't eaten in weeks.
[00:18:20] Do you guys have any eggs? And they're like, no eggs, no nothing. He's like, you're a liar.
[00:18:26] This is a French civilian, you know, like they've been through hell. He's like, you're lying. You
[00:18:31] have eggs. You've been given eggs to the Nazis, haven't you? And he's like, we found barrels of
[00:18:35] champagne. We found ham, salted ham. We feasted on that. And I was like, what's the message here?
[00:18:44] The message isn't my grandfather was pillaging of civilians. The message is salted ham and whatever
[00:18:54] luxury you could find was the best meal of his life because he didn't know if his day was going
[00:19:01] to end tomorrow. And I'm 12. And I'm thinking, you know, that could you imagine not knowing what
[00:19:10] tomorrow is going to be like and just having this opportunity for fellowship, camaraderie,
[00:19:17] and a warm meal? And you will literally do anything just for that moment. And he's
[00:19:23] at the time he was in his 80s. Now he's 102. He still thinks about that meal. It doesn't matter
[00:19:29] five star four star. He thinks about that meal in a barn, you know, next to a blown up 88.
[00:19:35] Like that's incredible to me. So you got this on one side. Meanwhile, your dad is all about
[00:19:41] education. Want you to how you doing in school? You know, I was my parents raised me right at a
[00:19:47] great school, great teachers. Everything was good. This wasn't I went to college and I was checking
[00:19:52] the box. And I remember my senior year I was in a library and I was I was a goofball and I was
[00:19:59] just trying to be funny and and be popular and and the little TV on the little, you know, roller
[00:20:06] cart TV. They plugged it in. It was October 93. And I'm watching Bill Cleveland get dragged to the
[00:20:12] streets of Somalia. And I felt like a complete fraud. I've never felt like this. It was the closest
[00:20:23] I've come to an out about experience where I thought I we can't be funny. We can't laugh.
[00:20:31] This is an American who dedicated his life to protecting us. And he's being dragged by a truck
[00:20:37] and, you know, ripped apart by kids and in Mogadishu and Blackhawk down. And I remember
[00:20:43] saying a prayer that I didn't know what life I would live. I had no idea it was going to be a
[00:20:48] dentist. I had 12 kids, one kid never married. I'm going to a Venge Bill Cleveland. That's all I
[00:20:54] wanted to do was just give me if it was a two week missionary trip. I'd find a way to get into the
[00:21:00] marketplace in Mogadishu. But I was going to stack up and just take a Polaroid and send it to the
[00:21:07] Cleveland family to say we got them. And the one thing that I never understood about soldiering
[00:21:15] was how important a venging loss is and how what that means for your morale, what that means for
[00:21:23] a family. And again, that's another disconnect with civilians. But knowing that the person that
[00:21:29] destroyed your life and took something away from you, that we got them, when a war became nothing
[00:21:35] but IEDs, nothing, but you never saw the enemy. You're listening to music and you disappear into mist
[00:21:43] in a war where you had the chance to see the enemy, fix them, and they're now afraid of you.
[00:21:51] That's why we fought. And Fallujah, Ramadi, Muttadaya, Bakjiba, those areas, Mosul, they gave us the
[00:22:01] opportunity to actually fight back when so many of the losses in Iraq at that point were ghosts,
[00:22:08] basically. I want to get to the point where you get done with high school, but there was a part
[00:22:16] of this book that I promised myself had to be read so that everyone could hear it. Here we go.
[00:22:24] When I was 17 in the summer of my junior year, my dad started a group for teens whose mission was
[00:22:33] to wait until marriage to have sex. The 4th of July was the biggest event in our small town.
[00:22:41] Our population of 750 would balloon to 3,001 afternoon, the fireworks, the parades, the chicken
[00:22:46] barbecue, the macrame plant hangers made this the go-to location in Orleans County. Inevitably,
[00:22:55] there was going to be a float for his new organization. My father came to me and explained
[00:23:00] how difficult it was to get older kids to join his group. And this is a group, like I said,
[00:23:05] this is a group for people that are going to stay virgins until they're married. I was stunned. How
[00:23:11] richly bizarre it was that teenagers didn't want to ride downtown declaring to all their peers
[00:23:17] they were virgins and not open for business. With a sober face and piercing eyes, he asked me,
[00:23:24] David, I would like you to be the king of our virgin float.
[00:23:30] Not having read the bylaws of the group to see if this sort of nepotism was allowed, it was quickly
[00:23:35] revealed that this was an acceptable policy. There was no disqualification in being related to an
[00:23:39] officer of the group and naming me the king of all virgins without a proper vote or at least
[00:23:46] having a board meeting. I was a good kid, shy, not exactly a ladies man and in fact a real bona fide
[00:23:53] virgin at 17. I just really didn't want to be on a float being pulled by a John Deere tractor in my
[00:23:59] hometown declaring to my entire community that my prom night didn't end like I had told all my friends.
[00:24:06] I was introduced to my queen. She was 12 years old. Every other kid on the float range from the
[00:24:14] ages of nine to a very mature 13. But I love my father. I could not let him down. People like you
[00:24:21] and if people like you and if they see you are waiting, maybe they will wait to, he said to me,
[00:24:27] dad, you are far overestimating my ability to influence my peer group. No one cares. This is
[00:24:32] humiliating. I rode on the float on a throne of chastity while girls who hadn't even reached puberty
[00:24:40] tossed tootsie rolls to my laughing peers. I wore that crown. I wore that sash that read,
[00:24:46] I don't until I do. That was the most emasculating 25 minute tractor ride of my life when the parade
[00:24:54] ended. My dad came up to me and said something I never forgotten. David, that was a very difficult
[00:24:59] thing I asked you to do. Remember this, if you live your life doing things that are difficult,
[00:25:03] but that are right, you'll find the strength to do tougher things when they count the most.
[00:25:08] My hero asked me to do it and I wouldn't have changed a thing because it made my father proud.
[00:25:17] I know you're a courageous guy. I can tell you when I was 17 years old that wouldn't be happening
[00:25:22] for me. I would have ran away, I think. To me, it was always obligation. Your father was your
[00:25:33] father and I loved my dad. There were times that when you become a father, you think,
[00:25:40] I don't know if I would have done that. I don't know if that lesson works out well today.
[00:25:44] The toughest thing I've ever had to do in my life was love my army when my army treated me like
[00:25:52] garbage. There's nothing more difficult than that, is to love your branch, love your chain of command
[00:26:01] when there's no reason to do it. That relationship with my officers was very much like
[00:26:08] my relationship with my father. These are the rules. You grow where you're planted. No one picked
[00:26:15] their unit. Very few people get a chance to pick their people and when they do, it's different.
[00:26:20] But here I am and these are my people and they're going to tell me what's going on. I'm going to
[00:26:25] knock it out. I'm going to find something because I would fear the enemy can kill you. The enemy
[00:26:34] can hurt you. The enemy could take your eyesight and your body parts. But the shame of letting down
[00:26:40] someone that was an officer in charge of me or a senior NCO was far greater than what the enemy
[00:26:48] could do. I was more afraid of what they could do to me than what the enemy could do. It sounds
[00:26:52] stupid to say out loud in your 40s, but I felt the same way about my dad. This man was, he was
[00:27:00] five foot three, never told me to lie and yet I'd look at his driver's license from New York
[00:27:05] State and I'm like, it says five nine. You're not five nine. What's going on here? But that was my
[00:27:12] dad and I loved him and that was a ridiculous request. A ridiculous request, but making him
[00:27:21] proud was everything to me. Did you play sports in high school? Yeah. What did you play? So we're
[00:27:27] a real small school. We didn't have football. So we were soccer, which is very difficult to get
[00:27:33] motivated for. But we did the basketball, soccer, baseball. Those are my three. And then you said
[00:27:40] you end up going to college. Yeah. And what do you plan when you go to college? What year is it?
[00:27:44] What year did you graduate? 94. 94 went to college, started off in New Hampshire and again, I went
[00:27:50] pre-med. Biochemistry was the major, but it was the pre-med. And then I had no, you know, really
[00:27:59] sheltered in a really small area. And so I wanted to meet, you know, girls. I wanted to be popular.
[00:28:07] And so I figured all the guys I met in the theater program just weren't that interested in women.
[00:28:12] It was really strange to me. And so I figured I'll see if maybe I could be like a theater minor
[00:28:21] and just kind of hang out in this crowd. And I had no real ability to do anything. And was
[00:28:31] shocking that they didn't care. Like nobody wanted to see me dance or sing or even attempt to act.
[00:28:36] They were just like, you want to be in this group? Go ahead. I'm like, this is like a degree.
[00:28:41] Don't you need to have some semblance? It was just like walking around everyone.
[00:28:46] Like everyone just was like, no, put a turtleneck on. You're a part of the club.
[00:28:52] And you're going to spend money to get a degree in something. And we don't even care if you're
[00:28:57] even good at it. And it really, because even the science guys cared. I mean, he had at least
[00:29:03] passed and do well. No one gave a damn about, you know, the fact that I couldn't do anything.
[00:29:10] So were you in plays or something? I mean, you have to be in everything,
[00:29:15] but it doesn't mean you're good at it. You know what I mean? Like you have to be involved, but
[00:29:21] and then like what you're graded on your effort. Like you're graded on how much you smile.
[00:29:29] I like how this is confusing to you to this day. Yeah. I was just like, this is like, I don't,
[00:29:33] I don't get it. And so you wonder why there's so many delusional people going to LA and New York.
[00:29:38] And it's because, you know, for four years, they're like, you are really trying hard.
[00:29:44] Like, well, listen, can I work? Can I get a job? We have a law, a federal law on a credit card
[00:29:53] that says if you pay the minimum in 20 years, this is what you're going to pay. But you can
[00:29:58] walk into a college today and get a degree in Shakespeare Shakespeare on stage. And no one
[00:30:06] has an obligation to be like, that's not a real job. By the way, you're never going to make money.
[00:30:12] What are you going to make it to 30? Nothing. How do you do a profit and loss? There were a lot
[00:30:17] of guys in theater departments and film that just, you know, what is Andy Warhol 15 hours of a guy
[00:30:26] sleeping? It's art. All right. You know, maybe you could be like Andy Warhol, you know? So yeah,
[00:30:34] it didn't work. So how long did you stay in college for? I stayed in for the remainder. It was my
[00:30:41] senior year of college second semester. And I had a professor tell me, and so I was getting more and
[00:30:48] more rebellious in the idea of I felt like my friends were in the army, my friends are doing
[00:30:55] cool things. And I just was like, I'm doing this for my father, I'm doing this for my mom, I'm doing
[00:31:01] this for everyone. And then these professors were just like, what have you done in theater? What have
[00:31:06] you done? Have you ever been in a movie or written a movie or anything? And the guy's like, you leave
[00:31:12] this school, you'll come back with your tail between your legs. And I was like, and do what?
[00:31:18] Teach? Like, do I have an outfit? Like, what am I going to do if I leave here? I, what have you,
[00:31:24] like, how are you teaching? Listen, I go to the range. So when I, it's a guy who really
[00:31:29] knows how to shoot a machine gun, teach me how to shoot a machine gun. It's not some guy who's
[00:31:33] like, I have this crazy dream about an 84 millimeter rocket. Let me give you a lesson on it. They
[00:31:40] actually are subject matter experts. I didn't understand why these people were professors
[00:31:44] and why they were doing. And so I just, my last year, I just said, I don't, I don't want to do
[00:31:49] this anymore. I want to leave. I want to go and, and, you know, maybe I'll write a screen player,
[00:31:55] maybe I'll write a book or maybe I'll do something to show that I don't need this degree. My brothers
[00:32:00] all had it. My brothers all did it. It was like a check the box. This I'm serious. I went into
[00:32:06] debt. That's how serious I am about being an adult. Like, if you don't take me seriously, I got a
[00:32:11] piece of paper that says I'm serious. You know, this is real. I put money into it. I wasted time.
[00:32:18] I'm a real adult. I was like, no, I don't, I don't want to do that. I want to do something
[00:32:23] that you don't think is intellectual, but I think is intellectual. And I can't think of anything.
[00:32:30] Every time I watch, I'm a big Buffalo Bills fan. Every time I watch football in the trenches,
[00:32:35] I'd go to war with that guy. It's a war is always a metaphor. There just wasn't a war.
[00:32:43] So I came home from college one summer and we had a home invasion. Now these two drug addicts
[00:32:50] broke into my parents' house. And I was like, this is my time. This is my fun. This is what
[00:32:56] I've lived my whole life for. I grabbed a Remington shotgun and I loaded it up. And I was, I'm going
[00:33:05] to shoot these guys. They're shirtless, shirtless guys just running around the house, cutting wires
[00:33:13] off of TVs, throwing them into their car, moving in and out. I had a Rottweiler at the time. I put
[00:33:19] the Rottweiler in the garage because I was afraid the Rottweiler would bite them. And I didn't want
[00:33:25] like there to be a liability issue. Like maybe they were my parents' friends. Maybe it was a
[00:33:29] misunderstanding, but I was shook. I was scared. And I grabbed this shotgun. I loaded it up. I felt
[00:33:35] it just like I had done previously. And I brought it up the stairs and I saw these guys. My mom had
[00:33:44] had neck surgery. My dad was taking care of her. They were on the other side of the house. And I
[00:33:50] just thought, you're going to, you're going to murder these guys. You're going to kill these guys
[00:33:57] and everyone's going to have to move out of the house. No, everyone's going to look at you differently.
[00:34:03] And what I was really doing was just buying time, right? Buying time for them to do something and
[00:34:09] run away or, and they didn't. And they looked at me with like zero fear. And that hurt. But that was,
[00:34:18] that's, you know, 3 a.m. inventory. No one saw that. But then my dad came out after these guys
[00:34:26] roll off. They get arrested. They go to jail. The whole trial. But right after they drove off that
[00:34:31] day, my dad looked at me and he looked at me in a way that was just, that was emasculating.
[00:34:37] Having your dad look at you and say, you're 22, 23, and you're not ready for the world.
[00:34:45] That was it. That was it. I'm like, I'm going to summer camp at Ben Hericott. I'm going to go,
[00:34:51] I'm going to get my PhD at the University of Fort Bennington, Georgia in human studies.
[00:34:57] And I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm never going to be, if there's a noise,
[00:35:02] anywhere I'm at, any situation I'm in, I'm going to handle it. Any situation I'm in. And, you know,
[00:35:09] you could be bigger than me, stronger than me. You could have more skills than me.
[00:35:13] I'm going to tear your eyes out or shoot you repeatedly. You know, there's going to be a,
[00:35:17] a, a series of escalation. But the reality is, I'm going to handle it. I'm going to handle it.
[00:35:24] I had no ability to control my destiny. I had no ability to handle anything. And the army gave
[00:35:32] me the opportunity to at least say, we're going to teach you enough to get your ass kicked in a
[00:35:36] fight, but we're going to teach you enough that you can control your, your destiny. And I needed
[00:35:42] that desperately. But there was no war going on. I was 99, you know, into the late nineties. And
[00:35:48] it was just learn how to march and do PT. And that's what I thought I needed. So infantry,
[00:35:55] they told me 11 X-ray met extra special. And so when I get there for a band, I'm like, I'm an
[00:36:03] X-ray. They're like, I'm a Bravo. And I'm like, what's that? They're like, that's real infantry.
[00:36:07] I'm like, no, it's not. They lied to you. But when I, when I got, when I got to Forbidden,
[00:36:12] Georgia the first night, there were kids like crying and nervous. I slept the best sleep I've
[00:36:19] ever had in my life in that. Cause I knew this is who I was. This is where I'd be safe. This,
[00:36:27] there was no stress. You know, these kids were like 1918. I was like, this is nothing. Oh,
[00:36:33] what are you worried about? Like this, this is what we're, this is why we're here. We're here
[00:36:38] on this earth. We were born to do this. Now we don't get a war. That's the part that's going to suck
[00:36:44] is we're just going to end up with a bumper sticker on our car. We're just going to say we're a
[00:36:49] vet and get a free meal at Applebee's. But, but listen, we, we, we offered. There was nothing
[00:36:55] for us to do. So you were that, you were that fired up like day one of boot camp? I had no idea
[00:37:01] was I wore khakis and a button down shirt because I wanted to impress. I wanted to impress my drill
[00:37:07] scientists and I was a professional and they told me that I was going to be there for like 15
[00:37:11] weeks. And so I didn't, I knew I had to shave my head, but I thought I was going to grow back.
[00:37:15] So I brought a hairdryer, right? Well, they shook my bag. They're like, what piece of shit?
[00:37:22] I was like, this is my first challenge. Like, do I own it? And I'm like, yeah, that's my hairdryer.
[00:37:30] They told me there was a couple of months here. I wasn't aware that there was a, a payday haircut.
[00:37:37] You didn't tell me that, you know? But, but honestly, I had no idea really what I was getting into.
[00:37:43] But the more I learned, I just, I looked at these drill sergeants and I was like,
[00:37:50] these are amazing. The NCO became, I'm so glad I didn't go officer, honestly, because I saw these
[00:37:58] NCOs and I was just like, this is everything I've always wanted to be. If I could have a son and
[00:38:03] I could see a person shoulders back, looking you in the eye and not, you know, not waiting to speak,
[00:38:11] but listening here in West Coast. And if you don't know the answer, you say, I don't know.
[00:38:16] Like, wait a minute, what is this magic? If you don't know something, you actually admit that?
[00:38:23] And then you make a mistake. You say, I did that. But you know what? It's not going to happen again.
[00:38:29] This was like learning a new language, a new way to, this was, this was true north.
[00:38:36] Nothing else is north, but that this is right. This is wrong and own it accountable, responsible,
[00:38:43] and, and ready for more to show that you're ready for more. You take whatever I'm guarding this
[00:38:51] little drinking fountain. But you know what? No one is stealing that drinking found. I'm 10 for 10.
[00:38:58] No fire on my fire guard. This is, this is, it was the greatest thing in the world for me.
[00:39:04] So you go to boot camp, really no factor for you. You're kind of loving it.
[00:39:08] Loving it.
[00:39:09] AIT. Is that where you go next?
[00:39:10] It's all one, one station.
[00:39:12] One big thing.
[00:39:12] Yeah. So infantry is all whatever you want. And then they said I was going to be mechanized, which,
[00:39:18] you know, Fort Drum, Fort Hood, it didn't matter. I just wanted to do, you know,
[00:39:24] what's a bunker? I mean, I just blew me away. And then I thought to myself, wait a minute,
[00:39:29] if a bunker is just this little thing, guys hang out and they shoot you, what's a window?
[00:39:35] You know, we have a different battle drill for that. But I'm like, but it's really a bunker,
[00:39:38] isn't it? And they're like, wow, this is a thinker. We got ourselves a thinker. So now these guys
[00:39:44] just say, let's explain something to you. A battle drill is like an audible. You see the
[00:39:50] linebacker come up. You see that you're not in man coverage. Now you're like, I think we're just
[00:39:55] going to react to the contact. But in that reacting to the contact, a million things can happen.
[00:40:01] And you've got to decide. So I didn't even fundamentally understand, I want to get you,
[00:40:07] I want to get close enough to kill you. That's the game, right? So in order for me to get close
[00:40:13] up to kill, you have to stop shooting at me so I could move. I'm like, wait a minute, this is
[00:40:18] making sense now. All these movies are making sense. So I got to keep your head down. So plunging fire
[00:40:27] is different than just shooting over your head. Right? I want to, I don't want to hit you necessarily
[00:40:33] do what would be great to take everyone out. And but it's not the way it works. They're moving too.
[00:40:38] They're getting away too. But if I can give you something to think about, I can get closer to you
[00:40:42] and the closer I get, the more accurate I can get and what's cover, what's concealment.
[00:40:47] Hey, the only thing I would give one more class, if you're going downrange fighting Europe or Asia
[00:40:55] or the Middle East, what cars have engines in the trunk and what cars have engines in the front?
[00:41:01] Because the first day you hide behind what you think is an engine block and those rows come flying
[00:41:08] through it like a knife through butter, you're like, oh, those damn Germans, they put it in the back.
[00:41:13] You know, that's the one thing I would change. But cover and concealment. I understand this,
[00:41:19] right? So now I get education. We have to be educated. You have to learn. And having what
[00:41:27] these young kids have today, what I didn't have, all my drill sergeants were making up stories
[00:41:32] about Panama. Everyone was at the soccer stadium. Every, you know, Bosnia, let me tell you how bad.
[00:41:40] No, there was no Haiti. You know, I almost jumped almost jumped into Haiti, almost did this, almost
[00:41:46] did that Gulf War. These men and women today, they got stories. These drill sergeants, these
[00:41:52] leaders are like, let me tell you why you want your chin strap on. Let me tell you why that
[00:41:58] sappy plate's important. Why we get low. Why it's important to bring the elbows in. What controlled
[00:42:06] fire actually is. What do you want? Hey, there's no drywall in the Middle East. That's all concrete.
[00:42:12] So when you start shooting inside of a closed quarter, that is coming back to you. It's a tick
[00:42:17] tack towing around, right? A grenade is great, right? Grin, throw the grenade and everything's
[00:42:23] over. Unless you don't have ventilation. Now you just threw a smoke grenade in a room. And the only
[00:42:29] people that know you're in there is the bad guy, because you don't know where they are. You've never
[00:42:34] been in the house before. And now they all know where the door is and where you are. So that
[00:42:38] frag, let's hope it was a smart frag and got, you know, all of these lessons learned that we never
[00:42:46] had and we learned in the actual battle and the ability to take information at the highest level,
[00:42:55] lowest level and share that information. I've never been in an organization on the civilian side
[00:43:01] that shares lessons learned like our military does. And it's a combat multiplier without a doubt.
[00:43:08] Yeah, no doubt about that. So you're learning from the I almost jumped into Panama,
[00:43:17] which God bless them. No, they were ready. They wanted to jump. They were ready.
[00:43:22] And so what's your first duty station then? Where do you end up? Where do you get assigned
[00:43:26] when you get done with bootcamp? AIT? You're now a what are you an E2 at this point? An E3? An E1?
[00:43:32] So basically, but the only advice I got from the drills, the recruiter was you're, you're,
[00:43:38] you can be a spec, you can be a specialist E4. Oh, okay. Because you're college. Don't do it.
[00:43:42] Oh, you got to earn that. Now, I didn't realize all I had to do is basically just not get a DUI
[00:43:49] for 12 months. And it happens automatically. But that first promotion felt like, you know, I was
[00:43:56] Thor. I mean, like getting promoted and seeing the increase in your, you know, in your pay. And
[00:44:03] like this was like a big deal. So E2 to E3 at a private, I have a rocker on my little private
[00:44:10] wings. Hell yeah. This was, I'm telling you, it was important. It was special for me. So I got,
[00:44:16] I got a duty assignment to Fort Hood, Texas. And in the process of doing that, my son is born,
[00:44:25] and he's born with a kidney issue. And so the army basically is like, Hey, there's no infantry duty
[00:44:33] station that has these pediatric nephrologists that you need. You got one at home, we're going to
[00:44:38] put you on a compassionate reassignment. I didn't even know what that was. And they were like,
[00:44:44] so go be a recruiter. You got a good GT score. We're going to keep you for two years on a
[00:44:50] compassionate reassignment till your son is old enough to go where you need to be.
[00:44:56] And we'll keep you in Buffalo. I was like, you know, they made up jobs for me at a recruiting
[00:45:01] station. And I just was miserable. I mean, seriously, that's what they did. That's what you did.
[00:45:07] You did. You did for the first 18 months of my army career. I was in a recruiting station.
[00:45:11] I would have volunteered to be a POW with that boy. It was absolutely. There's no more difficult job
[00:45:18] than being an army. Any recruiter is the everyone's disqualified. The game should be if you finally
[00:45:25] find someone answering the phone, you know, at the mall, I mean, you just disqualified,
[00:45:33] disqualified, disqualified. I mean, it's ridiculous. Everyone's disqualified.
[00:45:36] Disqualified. I remember one time I found a guy, he committed to the army. I brought his packet in.
[00:45:44] I had opened the door like on like a, you know, one of those hoverboards just floating through
[00:45:49] the office. I'd go to my station commander and he's like, hey, this guy was born on Christmas day.
[00:45:55] And I'm like, yeah, people get born on Christmas day. His name is Christopher Kringle.
[00:46:00] And I'm like, that's a weird coincidence. He's like, you're an idiot. You're an idiot. You just talked
[00:46:06] to Santa Claus. And again, no idea that there were people out there that would waste your time and
[00:46:13] that, you know, just your, that was a corporal recruiting program where they, and then they
[00:46:20] give you an NCO rank. And so at the time that September 11th hit, the army, obviously the
[00:46:28] military across the board, let's move people, you know, get on with your career.
[00:46:31] So were you in that in there when September 11th hit?
[00:46:34] Yeah. So from 99 until, you know, September 11th, I was in a recruiting and they said,
[00:46:40] look, here, three choices, reclassify to another job, go back to AIT and get another job that's
[00:46:46] near a place that the army will take care of the kid, get out of the army or go on what's an
[00:46:52] all others tour, which is 36 months away from dependence. And I'm like, well, which one gets
[00:46:58] me to the war? And to be honest with you, I love my country. I love my army and infantry,
[00:47:03] but recruiting also will make you want to go to war too. I don't do anything to get the hell out of
[00:47:08] that oven. They're like Germany. And I'm like, Germany, what is it? The big red one. And I'm
[00:47:13] like, I've seen the movie. Like I love the big red. I want to be in the big red one Afghanistan.
[00:47:22] Are they going to Afghanistan? They're like, Oh, no, no, no, no. Big red one hasn't done anything since
[00:47:26] 1996. We, you are only in charge of the very dangerous battleground of Kosovo. And I was like,
[00:47:34] Kosovo is a war, right? And they're like, technically, technically it's a war. I mean,
[00:47:40] you're not going to get combat pay, but you get like combat almost pay. It could be. So that was
[00:47:48] our big fight. We were peacekeepers, forward deployed Germany peacekeepers. And the big red one
[00:47:56] really hadn't been the big red one for a long time since the Gulf and even the Gulf War, we were
[00:48:02] the, we were kind of like the fake barn door that Saddam chased, you know, in the Gulf War. So
[00:48:08] it wasn't the Vietnam big red one or the World War II big red one or obviously the first World
[00:48:14] War. It was the peacetime peacekeeper, you know, stuff. And so I said, sign me up. I want to do it.
[00:48:23] I want to do anything that isn't recruiting. And that's what you did. So you go over there.
[00:48:28] Yeah. And how did you enjoy your time in Kosovo? Well, it was a six month tour that became a nine
[00:48:34] month tour and no offense to the Minnesota National Guard. But I don't think you got relieved by the
[00:48:39] Minnesota National Guard. Did you? You always know if, listen, National Guard units are incredible
[00:48:45] and they're awesome. But when, you know, a group that had never, ever, we got relieved by a National
[00:48:52] Guard unit that was calling like their Sergeant Major Phil. And like, I was like, what? It was a
[00:48:57] totally different world. I never experienced it before. So we were, we just felt like we were
[00:49:02] in the backwater. Everyone was getting Afghanistan. But my units in the second infantry, two, two
[00:49:10] infantry, the Ramrods and first ID and Alpha Company, Captain Walter, Captain Sims together,
[00:49:16] Colonel Newell, Sergeant Major Faulkeberg, Sergeant Major Bond, these guys all decided to take that
[00:49:22] nine months of Kosovo, three months extended and make it the practice for, for Iraq. And I got to
[00:49:29] tell you what, that saved so many lives because not only were we together for two years, right?
[00:49:35] 15 hour patrols of watching dogs mate, you know, in Kosovo, nothing happening, begging for someone.
[00:49:42] I mean, nothing was going on. But after that 15 hours, you're in the snow and you're training for
[00:49:51] the debt for the desert. You're not going to wear that baklava. You're not going to wear those boots.
[00:49:57] Get in your desert uniform, get out there in the snow and let's train for Iraq and Kosovo.
[00:50:04] We got all the rounds we wanted. Whatever we wanted, Claymore, never seen a Claymore since basic,
[00:50:10] you know, whatever we wanted, we had access to and we blew up pallets and grenades, pallets to C4.
[00:50:17] We were ready for combat because of Kosovo had Kosovo not happened. We wouldn't have got that
[00:50:21] training. So we graduated to a level that on day one, we could, we could fight. And that's why we
[00:50:27] were successful. And then you guys end up getting word that you're going to go to Iraq finally.
[00:50:32] In Kosovo, we're told we're in the, in the chute. So it got real serious. We literally would,
[00:50:38] we went our nine months, I think we refitted for 60 days, but that's like leave and requalifying
[00:50:44] and right back to, to the fight. So by the fall, we were in Germany and then we were three months,
[00:50:54] maybe I think is what we had. We went right to Kuwait and got ready for Iraq.
[00:50:59] I'm going to take you to the book here. When the army deployed the Ramrods to Iraq in February,
[00:51:05] 2004, we had a basic idea of where we'd be going inside the country. We ended up at Fob Normandy,
[00:51:10] which by the way, I got corrected by one of my Vietnam veteran friends that they say,
[00:51:15] he's like, it's F O B. So I don't know. I've said Bob the whole time. So there's been a transition
[00:51:22] till and the SOG guys from Vietnam. We say Fob now. So Fob Normandy in Diallo Province,
[00:51:30] section of Iraq between Baghdad and the Iranian border are area of operations included MOOC.
[00:51:35] What is it? MOOC. A size, a midsize city of about 150,000 fits. One of your guys was wounded in
[00:51:43] urban firefight in April, 2004, only a couple months after we arrived in theater to the north
[00:51:50] of the city lay open rugged terrain. When Americans think of Iraq war, the images conjured up are
[00:51:56] the street scenes in Baghdad or the flat expanse of open desert in the western part of the country.
[00:52:01] But our AO looked more like Vietnam in 1968. Thick palm groves grew in low spaces between
[00:52:10] gentle sloping hills. There were canals and rivers that the local farmers had harnessed to turn the
[00:52:14] land so bountiful that they'd become known as the bread basket of Iraq. Among the heavy
[00:52:18] vegetation and irrigated fields, small communities straddled the roads leading out. They were ramshackle,
[00:52:26] impoverished places but seated among them were wealthy Sunnis connected to Saddam Hussein's
[00:52:32] once ascendant bath party. Below these elites, the vast majority of the population were Shia
[00:52:37] Muslims with strong ties to neighboring Iran. After the American invasion in 2003, a kernel of
[00:52:43] resistance formed to the American occupation in one of these rural towns called Sincil.
[00:52:49] In the early stages of the insurgency, there were actually only a few locals involved who forged ties
[00:52:55] within Iran to secure important weapons explosives and ammunition. The palm groves around Sincil
[00:53:01] and its sister village became ideal places to cash those supplies. When the Ramrods first arrived
[00:53:07] at Normandy, the 4th Infantry Division had been battling this growing threat. They had identified
[00:53:12] six men as the leaders in the insurgency known as the Sincil 6. The 4th ID's intelligence guys had
[00:53:18] put their faces up on a wall, mapped and then connected them to various known hideouts and
[00:53:23] accomplices with different colored yarn. The first time I saw their bad guy map it reminded me of a
[00:53:28] Hollywood stalker's lair. With Sincil being the nexus of the insurgency's leadership, it became
[00:53:35] one of the most important sectors in our AO. Captain Sims frequently took us out there to meet
[00:53:40] the locals, drink tea with their leaders and discuss the needs of their communities. Classic
[00:53:44] counterinsurgency, win their hearts and minds, stuff that came straight from the Vietnam playbook.
[00:53:50] Within 30 days of our arrival, the Sincil 6 had grown to the Sincil 10. We tracked down and killed
[00:53:56] two of the original members. When the intel learned there were three brothers moving between
[00:54:00] Syria and Sincil to arrange another flow of weapons to that area, they ended up on a yarn-crossed
[00:54:04] wall map too. One of our special operations teams located trapped and killed one of the brothers.
[00:54:09] The other two escaped. Each time we thought we'd deal with this, we dealt with the Sincil
[00:54:14] a crippling blow, they emerged stronger with even more support from the local population.
[00:54:18] It was like fighting a contagious virus. For every patient we treated,
[00:54:23] three more infections would crop up. The Sincil 10 grew to Sincil 20 and then 30. After that,
[00:54:29] we just lost track as a wave of recruits, organizers and well-trained Iranian operatives
[00:54:34] flooded into the bread basket. That spring, the insurgency erupted all over the country.
[00:54:40] Between the first Shia uprising that displaced the Sunni ruling class rebellion,
[00:54:44] nearly every coalition unit was inundated with insurgents, planning IEDs, planning IEDs in their
[00:54:49] operational area, executing ambushes and launching attacks at key targets. As the weeks wore on,
[00:54:55] our trips to Sincil turned into a kinetic version of Groundhog Day. We'd go out so Captain Simms
[00:55:03] could continue to try to develop relationships with the local Iraqi power base.
[00:55:07] While he was talking to them drinking tea, the insurgents would be alerted to our presence and
[00:55:12] establish ambushes for us. That just kind of paints a picture of what you guys rolled into.
[00:55:19] Yeah, Fourth Infantry Division. So we started to see the extensions. You had a stop-loss that was
[00:55:26] going on when Iraq kicked off and a lot of people thought they were out of the military and they
[00:55:30] were kept in. But then you had the first real extensions. I think it was Karbala,
[00:55:34] was the first armored division that did, they were supposed to do nine months. Everyone was
[00:55:39] going to do nine months and then it became a year and then a year became 15. And there were units
[00:55:44] that were doing 18. And so we didn't really have, with the kinetic tempo that was going on,
[00:55:49] Afghanistan, Iraq, how are we going to replace these units? Are they doing sustainment,
[00:55:57] stabilization operations or are these still kinetic? We were told, you're not getting a CIB,
[00:56:04] you're not going to get a common infantryman's badge and you're not going to get a combat patch.
[00:56:07] They told you that when you got to Iraq in 2004? Absolutely. The mission accomplished,
[00:56:11] the war was over, you had to be engaged by the enemy, they kept changing what engagement was.
[00:56:16] So check this out. So you got there in February. I was there as well. I was wrapping up my first
[00:56:23] deployment. So I got there in 2003, I was in Baghdad and in April of 2004. So just after you
[00:56:31] arrived, we went, my task unit, my, it was actually just a platoon, it was my platoon, we went and we
[00:56:38] captured one of Sodder's top lieutenants down in Najaf. Yeah, we were there.
[00:56:45] Okay. So when we did that, it ignited everything. In April of 2004. In April of 2004. So the big
[00:56:53] fight was supposed to be in April of 2004. Fav Duke, which is the big Fav that we created in April of
[00:57:01] 2004. Where was it? Right outside of Najaf. Okay. That is named after my brigade, where the Duke
[00:57:08] Brigade, third brigade, first ID. That was, I've never, so you talk about the terrain,
[00:57:15] you know, a lot of vegetation, humidity. Najaf was straight up the oil bubbling. I mean,
[00:57:23] it is just nothing but sand. And the biggest cemetery in the world is in Najaf. And after
[00:57:31] August of 2004, they added a couple kilometers. If I'm not mistaken, that was a horrible,
[00:57:37] Mukhtan al-Sodder was this toothless, self-defined cleric. He didn't have the street credit to
[00:57:43] be a real cleric, but his dad ran that Mahadi militia, a Sotter city in Baghdad. These Mahadi
[00:57:52] militia guys, it was weird to see the gestation of the insurgency. The Mahadi militia knew enough
[00:57:57] to get killed. They really were not, they were wearing uniforms that were like gold and black.
[00:58:04] They didn't really have a whole lot of tactics. When the Iranians started to bring the Quds forces
[00:58:10] in Iranian Revolutionary Guard, got a whole different, their indirect fire much more accurate.
[00:58:17] The RPG7 as opposed to the five, the way they were trying to go after vehicles and tracks and
[00:58:24] the EFPs and the IEDs. But the other thing was when we started to make Iraq the insurgent
[00:58:31] all-star team and bringing in these boys from Chechnya. I mean, when you would go through
[00:58:37] Fallujah and pick up passports and be like France, Italy, Chechnya, Bosnia, there was a guy who
[00:58:47] was in Dearborn, Michigan. Can you imagine that? You were so hell bent that you decided to go to
[00:58:55] Iraq. I mean, what? But everyone from all over the world. The Jaffa was the first time our unit
[00:59:03] was able to show what, I shouldn't say our unit, armored first cab, fourth ID before us, third ID
[00:59:09] before us. But the first infantry division in that OIF one to two showed that tanks and
[00:59:18] Bradley fighting vehicles belonged in an urban fight. No one was using the Abrams in the city.
[00:59:25] No one thought what's a Bradley fighting vehicle. The thing about a good and again,
[00:59:31] all infantrymen think the mechanized are lazy and fat and they just want to eat and watch TV.
[00:59:37] And we hate the tankers in Garrison. We're beating up the tankers more than we're training.
[00:59:43] Infantry hates tankers. After Iraq, infantrymen and tankers are the best of friends. Because if
[00:59:51] you can support that, again, so many units, they take their platform, their support by a fire base.
[00:59:57] It's a five ton truck with a 50 cal. It drops you off and it goes home. You carry that support by
[01:00:03] fire base with you. You work in concert with the Bradley's on providing security for you.
[01:00:08] You're blowing pieces in the, you know, fun sized pieces for the enemy. That 25 millimeter high
[01:00:15] explosive autocannon is one of the greatest gifts the Pentagon gods have ever given us.
[01:00:21] And when you want to, I don't need a clear house. If I can have a gunner put two HE rounds in a room,
[01:00:30] it's over. We're feeling pretty good about it. We like, DraftKings has us, you know, as the favorite.
[01:00:39] What made me think of that is I could see your leadership telling you in what would it be
[01:00:44] in February or maybe even January of 2004, like, Hey, you're not going to get combat action.
[01:00:51] Right. You know, you're going to go, it's going to be, but I guarantee by April, when that, when
[01:00:56] they, when the, when the Maudi militia, when militia went berserk, you're going to get that
[01:01:02] combat action, whether you like it or not. It's common. Because they went, I mean, it was like a
[01:01:07] 180 degree turn. We were, I mean, the, I was up at Baghdad. We went down in the joff to grab this
[01:01:12] guy, Yacoubi, who was one of his lieutenants, and we brought him back. And by the time we got back,
[01:01:19] you know, it was just like, for us, it was another mission. Now we had been targeting
[01:01:23] Sotter for a long time, but they wouldn't let us do it. And they finally said, you know what,
[01:01:26] let's see what'll happen. Let's see what'll happen if we grab one of his guys. So they sent
[01:01:29] us to go do that. It was total mayhem. I actually felt bad. I felt horrible because
[01:01:35] the conventional forces got caught off guard. They weren't ready for it. And like in Sotter City,
[01:01:40] went totally insane. A lot of casualties there. And I remember the Baghdad where I was, we'd get
[01:01:48] an occasional mortar in there. All of a sudden, the front gates getting attacked. I mean, it was
[01:01:52] on. It was a radical change that happened when, after that mission. And it really fueled the
[01:01:59] insurgency. There's a couple of videos. We were getting ready to go to Najaf. We saw, I think the
[01:02:04] Poles, the Polish Army was at like a camp kilo, which was right outside of the city. So the Easter
[01:02:12] uprising in April of 04 was the insurgents attempt to cut Baghdad off. And you had Highway 5,
[01:02:18] which went from the East and Diyala all the way across Baghdad. And you had Fallujah, which was
[01:02:24] always considered to be like the Wild West of Iraq, even when Saddam was in power. And they built
[01:02:31] their homes. You know, like the Shia population, vast majority of Iraqis were Shia. Saddam had the
[01:02:37] Bathis Party, which was Sunni, but was weird about Iraq's culture as opposed to any other Middle
[01:02:43] Eastern countries that Saddam was able to make pan-Arabism in the war against Iran. He convinced
[01:02:50] half of the country to die for Iraq, the flag. And so when he puts Insha'Allah on the flag,
[01:02:58] this is like everyone was pro-Iraq in that war with Iran, which was very bloody and costly to the
[01:03:04] people over there. And so by the time you're building real estate, if you're in a Shia area,
[01:03:10] you are very insecure and you're building your homes very thick walls. You've got gun slits on
[01:03:17] all, I mean, you're ready for any minute that government's going to roll up and take your house.
[01:03:22] So you're, it's like siege warfare in a neighborhood. Everyone is ready for what's going on. I mean,
[01:03:29] the glass that was embedded in the concrete when you crawled over the walls, I mean, it was a very
[01:03:35] insecure culture. But Najaf was that Easter uprising. If you go to Arlington Cemetery in
[01:03:41] section 60, April 8th and 9th, you will see casualties from Ramadi, Fallujah, Diyala Province,
[01:03:53] Bakuaba, Sader City, Mosul. That's really when everything started was in that, and that one week
[01:04:00] in April from the Marines dealing with the Vigil Resolve and what they tried to do in Ramadi and
[01:04:06] Fallujah, they had to be basically, I mean, they were successful. They took the, but you had Al Jazeera
[01:04:14] and Al Arabia TV and the idea of civilians. Everything became a PR war and it started with,
[01:04:22] unfortunately, with Abu. And that horrific story where you had a National Guard unit
[01:04:31] abusing prisoners and it just put fuel on the fire.
[01:04:33] What a freaking horrible IO loss for America with these knuckleheads.
[01:04:43] Now, you remember the contractors, the Blackwater contractors.
[01:04:48] March.
[01:04:49] That happens. Where are you when that happens?
[01:04:52] So first of True Division's first brigade was brought in April of 04 for the Fallujah
[01:04:58] fight with the Marines. And again, AMBAR was, 82nd Airborne hands off AMBAR Province in April of 04.
[01:05:07] And the Marines take over AMBAR. There's really no, the army that is allowed, they're there
[01:05:16] blocking positions, support. It's not an army mission anymore when AMBAR is run by the Marine
[01:05:22] Corps. We've got the rest of the country and there's a whole lot to do, by the way. But all the
[01:05:26] attention is on the, I used to love that. In 06 when I went to Ramadi, when you were out there,
[01:05:32] it was, you couldn't say AMBAR Province, you had to say restive AMBAR Province. The restive
[01:05:37] AMBAR Province. Everything's like AMBAR Province, like they're eight foot Goliaths.
[01:05:43] They're different people. They're so tough. But AMBAR really is the first domino to fall
[01:05:49] with the pacification of, when the insurgency starts to really fall back, it's the Sons of
[01:05:57] AMBAR. That area though, in 04, the first ID, first brigade comes in to help in Vigil Resolve,
[01:06:06] which is April. And then they basically lose that Fallujah brigade. They pull out of the city.
[01:06:13] And that was a policy too, like just catapult the dead cow over the wall, let them get sick and die.
[01:06:21] We'll wait until April. But because we had N'Joff and we were able to pick up and move,
[01:06:26] that guy Fitz, Colin Fitz was my peer, he was the first squad leader. He got shot in April 8th,
[01:06:34] of 04, in Mukta Day. That kid got shot by three different weapons systems. And what I used to
[01:06:40] love is when a new guy would show up, I'd be like, the AK-74 is a different ballistic. Let me show
[01:06:46] you on his elbow. And he got hit by the 762 by 39, the PKM, which is the bigger 762 by what,
[01:06:55] 51? 54? 54. And the 74 is what, a 545? I think so, yeah. So that was the baby. But all three, so
[01:07:06] we were getting popped with, and we took out, I think over a two-day period, we took out 160.
[01:07:14] And they saw that that Bradley fighting vehicle was not to play with. It was not to play with.
[01:07:21] And COACS 25 go to N'Joff, show that we can work well with Marines. That puts a pin on a board
[01:07:30] where someone says, hey, I want to take Fallujah. How are we going to do it? Give me those Army
[01:07:36] 27 from Armored First Cab and 22 and 163 from our first ID. And so we were just there to help
[01:07:43] out the Marines in a block, one wing, and ended up being something a little bit bigger than that.
[01:07:49] But that's how we got our street cred. You got an interesting exchange in here in the book
[01:07:55] that I was very, very stoked to see. You say that's the map board hung on otherwise jailhouse bare
[01:08:03] walls right beside my cot and the homemade crucifix that held my helmet and body armor,
[01:08:07] no photos of home near my space, just the board with three maps of our area of operations,
[01:08:13] one depicting the road net, one depicting the political demographics, and one topographic.
[01:08:18] Surrounding them were the latest satellite and overhead images that Lieutenant Colonel
[01:08:22] Newell's Intel shop had pushed down to us. Hackworth says we need to outmouge the mouge.
[01:08:30] The hell does that mean? Work harder, stay out longer, be ferocious, never let them outwork us,
[01:08:36] dig in sometimes, take the high ground when possible, grab rooftops without turning the
[01:08:41] lights on in a house, never do the same thing twice. I wish I'd never given you that damn book.
[01:08:47] Lieutenant Colonel David Hackworth had been a staff guy in Vietnam writing counterinsurgency
[01:08:51] manuals in the Pentagon when he was ordered to put his theories into practice. He was sent to
[01:08:56] Southeast Asia and given command of the worst battalion in theater. He transformed it into a
[01:09:01] Viet Cong threshing machine known as the hardcore Rekondos. They damaged the enemy every time they
[01:09:07] left the wire. Fitz had given me Hackworth's memoir, Steal My Soldier's Hearts Before We Left
[01:09:13] Vilsack, which is where you are in Germany. I read it and absorbed its lessons. Then one day
[01:09:18] at Normandy, I sent him a random fanboy email through his publisher and agent. So you sent an
[01:09:25] email to Hackworth's, you know, publisher. He responded. He was in Mexico dying of bladder
[01:09:32] cancer. Without violating operational security, I sketched out our situation and asked what he
[01:09:37] would do. He offered excellent advice like a tactical dear abbey. We corresponded often.
[01:09:45] And this is what he wrote. You never let them outwork you and you will never be ambushed again.
[01:09:48] Your men will bitch. They will hate you. But in 20 years when you are all older, they will realize
[01:09:53] how much they appreciated the attention you paid to the details of war. Work harder. Do your best
[01:10:00] to leave enemy where you killed him. If your command makes you police up the dead, make him
[01:10:04] bleed enough for his buddies to know what happened there. Send the message. Mess with us and get
[01:10:10] wrecked. They shall fear our ferocity. I don't know if you know, but this book right here
[01:10:20] about face. I ended up writing the Ford for the new release of that book. Oh, it's classic.
[01:10:25] Yeah. I'm a huge and so the fact that he responded. Yeah, that's like, I was it would have been
[01:10:32] smart enough to email my well. And his ability to because his whole thing in Vietnam and again,
[01:10:38] Vietnam, we didn't invent counterinsurgency. Obviously, that's what we're doing. Vietnam
[01:10:44] outmouge the moose is what he would say because he was always talking about out Kong, the, you know,
[01:10:49] out enemy and out, you know, G the G out. Yeah, exactly. And I was out gorilla the gorilla. And
[01:10:55] so, you know, they're disciplined. We're more disciplined. But if you, you know, again, we
[01:11:01] were doing this thing where I would dismount out of a Bradley and I would see an ID. And I'm like,
[01:11:07] well, we dismounted because they saw the tracks there. So we're not just like they do with the
[01:11:12] Blackhawks. Fake land, fake land. We're gonna do that with the brads. You know, dismount left,
[01:11:19] ramp goes down, no one gets out. We drive around for another couple of kilometers, dismount more,
[01:11:23] no one gets out. Sometimes we stay in the Bradley. Sometimes we leave on the first, the third, the
[01:11:28] fourth, whatever, never ever egress the, you know, leave the battlefield the same spot that you
[01:11:34] dismounted and you would walk up on these guys and and the feeling you get after, you know,
[01:11:41] you're cold. I mean, people tell you it's 50 degrees. What was 120 during the day?
[01:11:46] I mean, that's a huge drop in temperature and you're cold and you're miserable. And
[01:11:50] even though the smokers couldn't smoke, we wouldn't let the dippers dip. You know, everyone's gonna
[01:11:56] suck together. But when you get, you know, when you get the enemy and you knock them cold and
[01:12:03] they don't even see you coming, there is Christmas Day is a beautiful day that we all love and get
[01:12:08] excited about. But when you can shoot a terrorist that doesn't know you're there, it is the greatest
[01:12:14] feeling in the universe to pop a guy who's like loading a fuse on an RPG. That is the greatest
[01:12:22] experience in the world. You're going to try to hurt us, kill us. And you don't even know we're
[01:12:26] there. That was, I took, I took the counter ID counter ambush missions. They were the most
[01:12:34] important part of my life. And I was just absolutely almost to a point where, you know, it was a
[01:12:40] little bit of obsessive compulsive about, Hey, the tankers got hit, got hit over here. They were
[01:12:45] using propane and bouncing a propane tank up to hit these guys at chest deflate. There would be
[01:12:54] mobility kills, but they would wait. You would see a van with a bunch of camera equipment.
[01:13:02] We're doing a wedding. I want to see the video. I don't think you're doing a wedding.
[01:13:06] A casket. You want to talk about the big, I remember the day that I pulled my, my testicles out
[01:13:14] metaphorically. It was the most brazen thing I've ever done in my life. They didn't ever want us to
[01:13:19] interact. You know, you're having a funeral, a wedding, women are respected, respect the culture.
[01:13:26] It was time I asked someone to open up a casket. And that took as, because I'm telling you that
[01:13:33] could have been the end right there, but it just, it didn't seem right. It didn't seem right.
[01:13:38] So what was in it?
[01:13:40] A body. Unfortunately, I guessed wrong on that one, but, but I was, I was thinking this is where I
[01:13:48] carry munitions. I would, I would do a fake funeral. I do it because they show up at the grave.
[01:13:55] Nejof, you saw this in the cemetery all the time. You know, are you burying a body? You know,
[01:14:00] but you had to think like that and you're going to be wrong and you're going to, you're going to
[01:14:04] make a mistake, but your guys are not thinking like that. And, and we had to think outside of the box
[01:14:11] to be able to, to, to fight the enemy the way we had to, but I, I guess wrong on that one. But I,
[01:14:18] there wasn't a wedding. I got the wedding vote right there. They were filming us at checkpoints.
[01:14:24] I got that right.
[01:14:24] Uh, you mentioned Fitz. You talk about Fitz here. I remember watching Fitz get hit over and over
[01:14:30] again, limping, dragging himself to cover, still shooting as he moved. When he went down, I thought
[01:14:35] he was dying. It was like a tectonic shift seeing him like that. My world rocked when Fitz was gone,
[01:14:42] back at hospital, somewhere safe. I'd never felt more alone. No one gave us status reports on our
[01:14:49] wounded, healthy looking guys who got evacuated, died. Men like Tyler Pruitt, a tanker, medic whose
[01:14:55] foot was mangled by a rocket that struck his home. These door, we raced to the scene, cleared the LZ
[01:15:00] for a dust off. They loaded him onto the medivac. There was no sense of sudden urgency. He was a
[01:15:05] medic and treated his own wound. The morphine induced smile and a go kill that piece of shit.
[01:15:11] Thumbs up. He was fine. Pruitt's war was over. My squad found the plastic chair, the insurgent
[01:15:17] used to ambush them. My squad went through hell to track this guy. Murder hornets, giant orange
[01:15:23] wasps native to that region, stung Joey Swanson more than eight times in the face as he was
[01:15:28] clearing out a cache this guy had had on standby. We stayed well past nighttime in a dense palm
[01:15:34] grove soaked to the bone, heads pounding from dehydration just to maintain the promise of shooting
[01:15:39] this guy for Pruitt. The vegetation was too thick. The trail dried up. Two days later, I was drinking
[01:15:46] a cup of coffee in the chow hall when his platoon sergeant told me that he died of a blood clot.
[01:15:51] This made no sense. I would never have given up for the night if I knew I was tracking Pruitt's
[01:15:56] killer. I would have lived out there for weeks. I was shocked and felt selfish for quitting.
[01:16:03] When Fitz returned to us, it was a Lazarus moment for me. A Lazarus moment for me. I just assumed
[01:16:09] he would be the same as he was before he got hit. But that pipeline, those hospitals, the physical
[01:16:16] debilitation, it always changes a person. I couldn't understand what he was going through. I could see
[01:16:22] his physical pain. Also, he knew the sound of bullet made when it smacked into bone. Every round
[01:16:28] that cracked nearby reminded him of that possibility. He knew the agony of lead mushrooming into your
[01:16:34] muscle fiber. He blinked with every shot expecting impact. Fitz was right. He'd seen that side of
[01:16:41] war that I had missed. The combat support hospitals, the emergency surgeries as men bled out on the
[01:16:48] operating room tables. He'd woken up surrounded by burned, limbless men and women clinging to life
[01:16:54] as the nurses and doctors struggled to patch them together. His war was different. That was the root
[01:17:01] of his caution when he came back to us. It wasn't that he feared that for himself. He feared it for us.
[01:17:09] Fitz feared it for me.
[01:17:16] So there's a next level badass, right? He gets freaking shot with three different types of
[01:17:20] ammunition, gets Kazovac out of the country. And he's still wounded. I mean, he's still messed up.
[01:17:28] And when they say, you know, hey, where do you want to go back to in America? What do you want to do
[01:17:32] for the, you know, for the rest of your recovery? He says, no, send me back to Iraq on the beat of my boys.
[01:17:38] Yeah. And honestly, you know, at this point in my life, I'm, you know, 28. These kids are 18, 19.
[01:17:47] There's a huge cycle of life that you go through at that age. And, you know, with the family and
[01:17:53] responsibilities and young kids, Fitz was in the army much longer than I had been, done more,
[01:18:00] his tactical proficiency, you know, watching him, it was always this, when you have two disembodied
[01:18:07] squads, it's always a race to the objective who gets there first, you know, you don't want to be the
[01:18:11] support element. It's the worst, you know, your local support. And in training, he, they, you know,
[01:18:17] he was the guy, the big personality, the senior squad leader. And every, every, you know,
[01:18:25] rotation we did, his unit was the, always the assault unit. And I second there. And then I'd
[01:18:32] be in the back of it. I'd move my position in the Bradley and the Convoy. I want to be in the back.
[01:18:36] They're going to hit the back. They hit the front. I keep moving. I never, we never got any action.
[01:18:40] And so when, when I learned from him though, was his ability to the elevation on an urban
[01:18:50] battlefield, you know, we talk about little round top and Gettysburg that you're not going to get
[01:18:56] that in the desert scape. You're not going to get that in the Middle East. So we're going to use
[01:19:00] our buildings, but we're also going to be careful not to just go through the front door every time.
[01:19:06] Right. If we can go roof to roof, we'll try that. But we can also find ways that if I've got a
[01:19:13] outer cord on, inner cord on, and I'm around a building, if I can have someone from the outside
[01:19:18] just clear two corners, I can tell that guy coming through the door, worry about corner three and
[01:19:23] four. One and two is good. No one's going to be to your right. No one's going to be your left.
[01:19:28] Focus on what's important. Also, I was obsessed with booby traps, platter charges, doors that
[01:19:37] would blow up, grenades on a handle. And he's like, listen, we had no time for that. It's either
[01:19:43] going to happen or it's not going to happen. I'm like, Fitz, we just heard about a special
[01:19:46] four-in-a-street unit just had a building contained ID. They lost everyone. He's like,
[01:19:50] you tell these 18-year-old kids that there are wires out there that they're going to trip over.
[01:19:55] They're going to think about those wires. The sawgunners aren't going to be looking forward.
[01:20:01] I would go to the classes that Delta Force and Special Forces would train. They take two NCOs
[01:20:06] per company. And guys like you that are just hockey helmets and they'd be like, let's talk
[01:20:15] about this rationally. And you always had one intellect and one just giant, he has eight heads
[01:20:21] on his bicep and he's just there. And the intellect guy would be like, think about this.
[01:20:26] What's the easiest way to move through a building? And they put the flyers up, right? They would
[01:20:32] send someone forward. That's what elite people do. Small unit elite folks that have the training
[01:20:38] will do that. We're not elite, right? We're not going, you go into a house and find a cookbook
[01:20:45] and leave. One guy has a bullet in his head. There's a family of seven. They don't even know dad's
[01:20:50] dead and the cookbook is missing. That's what you do. We don't do that. We're high intensity.
[01:20:55] Know your role, know your lane, know your skill level and master it. Just master what you do.
[01:21:02] We have to strong wall. We have to have one firewall, keep all of our fire contained. And you
[01:21:08] know what? If it takes a break, a 20, you know, I remember the first time I got in a house fight
[01:21:14] way before and thank God our crescendo to violence was graduated because if we would have gone to
[01:21:21] Fallujah, it would have been over. We had engaged at close quarters. We had taken targets out in
[01:21:27] buildings and every single time to be a new twist and we learned from those twists and it allowed
[01:21:32] us to mature. So by the end of the rotation when Fallujah happened, we were ready. But I remember
[01:21:37] my team leader took a shot. Saw Gunner took a shot and I was saying I was still giving the
[01:21:46] hand at our signal. We're like clear, clear, clear. Like, bro, you just dropped a guy, you know.
[01:21:53] They know you're here. You know, after you shot the guy in the living room, I think the guy upstairs
[01:21:58] is aware. Maybe the Americans are here. You know, there's no point in whispering. There's no point.
[01:22:03] You know, the old days, you know, a rolling tee in a hallway or you'd see a couch or refrigerator
[01:22:10] and it'd be like, OK, I'm going to open one, two. Like, why would I open an refrigerator door like
[01:22:15] that? You know, to be like, this is what they trade. This is what they taught. It's all horseshit.
[01:22:20] Put a round through. Put a round through the couch. Put a round through the curtain.
[01:22:25] Don't even bother with the crazy. The other thing was, I found, in a minefield,
[01:22:31] they were Italian tow poppers. I never even seen a landmine in my life. In fact, I thought there
[01:22:38] were RPG fins. I really thought someone had buried like a bunch of cigarettes in an ashtray.
[01:22:44] They just put RPG fins and there's wires connecting them and I'm like, oh my god, oh my god, what do
[01:22:50] I do? What do I do? You know, and so I'm going through like at the range. Everyone turn off
[01:22:55] their electronics, probe their way back and I look and everyone's gone. Everyone got out of the
[01:23:02] danger. I was still there and I'm trying to get underneath one of the mines and put some C4 down
[01:23:07] there and I look over and there's Fitz. Fitz wasn't even near me. He got to me. Here's a guy that
[01:23:15] wants to be in a minefield with me only to tell me as two NCOs that electronic stuff is bullshitting.
[01:23:24] He said, listen, man, I love you. I love what you're doing. You buy the book, but listen,
[01:23:30] we're not getting an EIB here. This is no expert. No one's watching us. Who gives a shit? You know
[01:23:37] what you do with a minefield? Avoid it. Get the hell out of it and avoid it. And then he sat me
[01:23:43] down. He's like, obstacles. Why do you put an obstacle out there? I'm like, well, you're watching
[01:23:48] it. He's like, yes. I'm going to put an obstacle down because I'm going to overwash the obstacle.
[01:23:53] So what does that tell us? Tell someone's here. Someone wants us to go through that.
[01:23:58] Now, let's start to box around these open objectives. Let's think and use what we're learning.
[01:24:05] That's what he did. He gave me that right seat ride every day. And when he left,
[01:24:12] I'm just like, now I'm the guy. And I don't know what the hell. I mean, I was learning a lot too.
[01:24:20] And how long was he gone for? So he had hurt in April, came back in August. So that's a,
[01:24:28] you know, a pretty long, I mean, that was a big chunk. But when he came back, I thought we were
[01:24:34] going to be the, you know, flying Eagles again. I thought we were going to be like a, you know,
[01:24:39] the road warrior tag team. And it was noticeably different. It wasn't that he was afraid. He was
[01:24:46] in the fight all the time, but it was like, let's be smarter about this. You know, there's no need
[01:24:52] to, you know, I love taking the Bradley and bashing it through a building. It was one of my
[01:24:57] favorite things to do. I mean, we're going to, and he's like, what happens if we lose that Bradley?
[01:25:03] And I'm like, we fix it. He's like, okay. In three weeks, when you get the parts,
[01:25:08] I just lost a Bradley. Now guess what? That's one less six guys. And I don't have that firepower.
[01:25:14] We treat that thing with respect. You're not bashing it through anything. I was like, all
[01:25:19] right, okay. Heartbroken over here. Yeah. I was like, well, what am I supposed to do? Like,
[01:25:23] so we started to realize that the guys laying IEDs didn't know the people paying them. And the guys
[01:25:30] wiring it didn't know the people laying it down. So why don't we start digging holes? Why don't we
[01:25:35] start putting IEDs down? Why don't we intercept this machine? The only difference was I wanted
[01:25:43] to kill the bad guy. And Captain Sims wanted Intel for Colonel Newell and the S2 shops. And that's
[01:25:50] the part that broke my brain because I thought we were going to win the war by killing. And
[01:25:57] that's not necessarily the way you went in insurgency. Yeah. So that's a point in the book
[01:26:03] that you talk about is your differences with Captain Sims and how you guys are reconciling
[01:26:09] those differences. He was of the mind, hey, we need to form relationships with a local
[01:26:15] populace. We need to learn from them. We need to support them. We need to keep them safe.
[01:26:19] You were like, hey, we need to kill all these bad guys. And you guys got some tension over that.
[01:26:26] Yeah. I mean, if you could randomly go through a marketplace and every one of these dead guys
[01:26:32] is on our Bolo list, well, isn't that something? It could be that we, the way it was telling you,
[01:26:38] like, well, 2 percent of the population, those are the assholes. The rest of them are good people.
[01:26:43] It's a city of 500,000 people. Yeah. It's a lot of assholes. That's a lot of assholes.
[01:26:46] 2 percent of that's a crazy disproportion of assholes living in a zip code. So he was right.
[01:26:54] And I think history proved that. I think that the counterinsurgency model, the surge,
[01:27:01] occup- the fob is one thing, but the cob was a very successful way to say, look, we're not just
[01:27:07] going to engage in a fight and leave. We're going to live here. We're going to stay here.
[01:27:13] We're going to own the violence and only use the violence when it's when it's necessary.
[01:27:18] I didn't grasp that. I was still thinking Old Testament. I, you know, and so the Iraq war
[01:27:26] in our year in Iraq, counterinsurgency was a huge part of what we were doing. It was very
[01:27:30] early in the beginning of implementing that, but Fallujah was not a counterinsurgency war.
[01:27:35] Ramadi was not that type of fight. Now you had some incidents that really kind of brought this
[01:27:42] to a head. A couple incidents that really brought this to a head with Captain Sims. One was this
[01:27:46] giant guy that comes walking down the street. You guys are in a position and this guy comes
[01:27:52] walking some Iraqi. He comes walking down the street. He's got a freaking sword. And
[01:27:59] talk us through, talk us through what happened there. Look, I would always be shocked that I
[01:28:05] would see a 12 year old Iraqi and he looked like a six year old back in the United States.
[01:28:09] They wasn't a well fed population and you don't see giant. This guy was like six, eight,
[01:28:16] three, 30. I mean, he was a big, the corn fed big dude. And he was just acting crazy. Now we
[01:28:24] knew people were doing drugs. We'd gone, you know, you deal with all of that. You got the
[01:28:31] drunks, whether they're alcohol policies or liberal or conservative, people are still drinking.
[01:28:35] 100%. People are still doing drugs. But this guy was at a, and we were getting so many,
[01:28:41] there was this weird schizophrenia going on in the military at that time, at least in the army,
[01:28:46] where we wanted to kill the enemy to get on a report. But you also wanted to win hearts and
[01:28:52] minds and have us quiet area. So if you're going to have allowed a fight that showed up on some
[01:28:58] generals radar, you wanted it to be a fight where Americans were killing bad guys and not getting
[01:29:04] killed. You never wanted the report of, you know, you lost 10 guys and you killed maybe 20. You
[01:29:10] wanted to be overwhelming so that if you got on a general's desk, it was because you guys were
[01:29:15] badass and killing. And the other side was you wanted nothing on the report because that meant
[01:29:21] you were doing your job and there was nothing happening. So we found that the first infantry
[01:29:26] division was, you know, doing a pretty good job of eliminating, all I have to was when we really
[01:29:34] started to see the enemy being attritted through special forces and other units of Marines and
[01:29:40] Ambar and everyone else. And there was this weird at a boy, you're making us proud, you know,
[01:29:47] you know, colonels are going to get stars based on that. But then you had the guys on the ground
[01:29:52] and in the S shops and in the Intel and they were like, and the SF guys who were like, you know,
[01:29:58] we're just going to stir the hornet's nest. I mean, our green Berets were like, I'm going to go
[01:30:02] piss off about 500 people. And then we're going to call you boys in to just, you know, that's what
[01:30:09] they did. They would go into an area. We took a bad guy out. We surgically removed someone, but
[01:30:15] they have like 40 friends. Hey, you guys go handle that. And this was the relationship.
[01:30:21] This giant, it was a day when we had a big wig fly in and was looking at the area and they're like,
[01:30:27] no contact. Just this is going to be one night where you're just going to new Testament, you
[01:30:33] know, turn your orders are go out there and just do no, no gunfire. Don't, don't, don't get in a gun
[01:30:39] fight. Don't get me. Can you do me a favor, bell? No, don't, don't gunfight tonight. That's what
[01:30:43] you get told. And it was legit. And it was all the way down. And I had no intention to get in a
[01:30:47] gunfight, but the guy's six foot eight. I'm not, you know, Gracie trained, you know what I'm saying?
[01:30:53] I don't have the cauliflower ears and I don't have the, but I learned enough to know, you know,
[01:30:59] if I hit a guy and I pop him good or I use my helmet, you know, a buttstock, something I could,
[01:31:07] I could subdue someone and I got enough guys to zip tie him. This guy was like, he was huge.
[01:31:14] I mean, he was huge. And it got to the point where I had no choice. I slung a Mossberg and I
[01:31:20] had an M four. And when he was, he had my Mossberg and it was slung on my IBA. So when, you know,
[01:31:30] he had, he had positive control over my shotgun and, and we had to put him down and, and it was
[01:31:36] just, he was really angry. And the guy had a mental issue. So he's, he's a community local guy that
[01:31:46] everyone loves and adores. He's a big, gentle giant. But, you know, whether he was drunk or high or
[01:31:53] both or who knows, but it destroyed the community. It destroyed our relationships with the community.
[01:31:59] And it's the weird juxtaposition of combat where a soldier could be honorable and protect his people.
[01:32:08] And a bad guy could be beloved and a really good guy too. But when those paths cross,
[01:32:16] it's what comes, it's why wars, you know, wars hell.
[01:32:19] Yeah. One of the terms I learned from the count from my army counterparts in
[01:32:24] in Ramadi was good shot, bad result. Meaning like, Hey, this guy, whatever was wrong, he was drunk
[01:32:31] or whatever, acting crazy. And you wish it could go a different way. But here's this guy, you try
[01:32:38] and subdue him. He fights now he's fighting you. Now you're fighting a guy that's six foot eight,
[01:32:44] whatever, 300 pounds. Now all of a sudden he has your shotgun. And there's just like this,
[01:32:51] this is just what's going to happen. You have to kill this guy. If I walked away from it,
[01:32:54] now he's I mean, how many times I've had, we had kids that would give, you know,
[01:33:00] numbers and four vehicles, five pack come in this way. And, you know, we had leaders that were like,
[01:33:06] under no circumstances will you engage children at all. Hey, I don't want that on my conscious,
[01:33:12] no one does. But they're also giving away our position. So if I'm not going to engage him,
[01:33:19] you know, lethal, we're going to take this kid down and get him out of. If you let a guy in
[01:33:25] the battlefield, you know, point out where everyone is, and you're giving away everything. So he has
[01:33:33] to be confronted, whether or not what the means you confront him are the way. But when you're
[01:33:39] throwing a sword around, and you're cutting soldiers and swinging it, you know, again,
[01:33:45] I got myself in that situation. I shouldn't have I did I found myself in that spot. I had to get
[01:33:50] myself out of it. We did. But I learned a lot of lessons and lessons are that, you know,
[01:33:57] when the orders are no shooting, you avoid it. You're not in the open. You go into you take
[01:34:04] a house down, you get on a rooftop. You're not standing in the street. You're not pulling security
[01:34:09] the way we did. Had Fitz been there, I don't think that would have happened. But he wasn't.
[01:34:14] And, you know, it happened. And again, there's a look, I'm reading little excerpts of this book.
[01:34:20] This book is a is an incredible book. Just there's so much in here. There's there's entire story
[01:34:26] lines in this book that we're not even touching on in what we're going to talk about today. So
[01:34:31] if you're listening, just get the book. It'll really help you. This part is one of the stories,
[01:34:38] one of the storylines about this sort of differences in thought between you and Captain
[01:34:45] Sims. And just just given some more about Captain Sims here, just to give some background on him.
[01:34:54] You say this Sims walked like a man who had a bolder on his back but was too proud and stubborn
[01:34:59] to admit the weight was crushing him. Upright shoulder square, he made his way to us. In some
[01:35:05] ways, I suppose taking Alpha Company into Fallujah was his destiny all along. He was the son of an
[01:35:10] army officer who survived two tours in Vietnam. His uncle also fought in Vietnam, completed two tours
[01:35:17] and was disabled by wounds received there. His grandfather was a 36 year two war veteran of
[01:35:23] our beloved service. Sean had been born in Taiwan, went to high school in Korea, came home for college
[01:35:30] to the country his family had given their lives to defend. Sims had been a high achiever, never
[01:35:37] type a but rather a devoted, studious and introspective officer with plenty of grit. He
[01:35:43] checked all the boxes, Pathfinder and airborne school, Ranger school, armor officer school,
[01:35:51] at infantry officers basic, he had been the platoon's top graduate. Along with the weight of
[01:35:56] leading a company into the worst urban hellscape US forces had experienced since Way City Vietnam
[01:36:03] in 1968. Captain Sean Sims carried the legacy of his family's heritage on his shoulders as well.
[01:36:14] There's a lot, a lot for this guy to be, you know, doing. Yeah, you know, I love West Point and
[01:36:23] Annapolis are great institutions, but so many of these ROTC guys, you know, they've
[01:36:29] officers are officers and the good ones, you know, you learn a lot from bad leaders without a doubt,
[01:36:35] you know, you learn what's what you don't want to be. But the good ones, sometimes that seed gets
[01:36:40] planted and it grows and bears fruit 20 years later. And I guess having someone that's so
[01:36:48] intellectual and forward thinking that he's like, there's a way that we can fight wars and not lose
[01:36:54] our soul. I would have mortgaged my soul. I mean, honestly, if you would have told me,
[01:37:01] this is going to be the future, but you can control the present and save lives and bring
[01:37:07] everyone home and be successful. What would you be willing to give? I would have given you everything,
[01:37:14] everything. I don't care about being 40. I don't think I'm going to make it to 29.
[01:37:20] No one's thinking about, you know, no one's buying a 30 year mortgage when they're deploying to
[01:37:25] Ramadi. You're not, you're not looking at the future. You're looking at now and to have these
[01:37:30] people that were like, listen, there's a way to do this. There's a way to do it. When a new soldier
[01:37:37] came in, I wanted them to see the enemy, especially if we killed the enemy. That is, that's something
[01:37:46] that if you're not accustomed to, you know, moving a body off the battlefield, why is that important?
[01:37:52] It's a, there's a reverence. We're not out there, cowboys. We're not disrespecting the enemy. We
[01:37:59] respect the enemy. It's, it's, it's, there's a holy relationship between combatants on the
[01:38:05] battlefield. And you have to respect the enemy, but you also have to acknowledge that there is
[01:38:10] something special about what is going to be needed for you to be able to go home, walk off, more
[01:38:16] importantly, win the objectives that were there to win. Right? So, so I can't have a guy brand new
[01:38:23] in the country who sees a body and completely, you know, comes unglued. This, this is a part of
[01:38:30] the business. So here's the deal. I don't need you to be on point for the first two weeks, but I
[01:38:35] need you to follow up and I need you to know what it's like to have a rifle crack next to your ear.
[01:38:41] I need to know what it's like to be near a firefight, even if you don't do anything because
[01:38:47] you're brand new. But when that, when the aftermath and we go through that limit of advance and we
[01:38:52] cross that battlefield, I want you to pick them up. I want you to put them in the bag. I want you
[01:38:57] to own this because this is all of our actions and, and this is something you're going to have to get
[01:39:03] accustomed to and the reverence you show, the reverence you show because I, nothing would
[01:39:09] infuriate me as much as I would want to poke, you know, I'd end your life if you disrespected one of
[01:39:16] our fallen. I mean, that's, that's unforgivable. But I also was highly defensive over the way the
[01:39:24] enemy was treated as well. We're not savages. We're not Russians. We're not Chinese. We're not
[01:39:31] Mujahideen. We're American soldiers. We'll conduct ourselves that way. We're professionals and you
[01:39:37] will show respect to the enemy. We're going to kill them. And if they're dumb enough to raise kids,
[01:39:43] my boy is going to kill your boy too. That's just who we are. But there's a way that you
[01:39:48] respect the enemy on the battlefield and, and understanding that, you know, this idea, they're
[01:39:52] meat. They're just, you know, leave them out there to rot, leave them out there to be, you know,
[01:39:57] whatever. There's a time when that's unacceptable. Civilians have to know we're the good guys.
[01:40:04] We're always going to be the good guys in any circumstance.
[01:40:08] So now we're advancing through this deployment and now you guys find out you're going to Fallujah.
[01:40:15] How does that take place as far as are you starting to prepare in any particular way?
[01:40:20] And what's the timeframe between you guys getting tasked with going to Fallujah and actually
[01:40:25] getting there and, and like what, what timeframe did you get tasked?
[01:40:30] We were supposed to go to Mosul. That was the first rumor mill and Charlie Company ends up
[01:40:36] going instead of us. But we know that we're going to be used again. I understand, you know, April
[01:40:42] 04 and the Jaff that was supposed to be the fight. The fight didn't happen until August.
[01:40:47] So the army command is realizing that this is the year we got to start doing something
[01:40:52] or we're just going to be kicking the can down the road. And Fallujah was really depending on
[01:40:56] the presidential election between Bush and Kerry. The fight was supposed to happen in October.
[01:41:02] You know, it's politics. The elect, we're not going to fight a major battle before an election.
[01:41:07] It'll look bad. Wait until after the presidential election. So that was November 8th that year.
[01:41:13] And so we knew that we had our orders. You know what's happening in the army by how good your food
[01:41:19] automatically becomes. And you know how, you know, something shitty is coming because like,
[01:41:25] hey, let's redo their cell hall. Let's get these boys some toilets, you know, they deserve cable.
[01:41:30] They're, and so all of a sudden we start getting brown and root people and electricity. We had
[01:41:35] power. We didn't have water. And all of a sudden, all these things start happening. We're like,
[01:41:40] uh-oh. And then like, we had problems with vehicles for a very long time. And all of a sudden,
[01:41:46] like a GS 15 master carpenter is like, I could fix your rooms and, you know, you want a new gun
[01:41:54] tube for that Abrams. I've got four in the truck. You know, they were fixing everything.
[01:41:58] And then everything, I was like, Hey, can I, we were at one point on a bullet count, right?
[01:42:05] At one point we had to be like, how you got a every day come up with a certain amount of bullets
[01:42:11] so that we're not, you know, we know who's shooting what when it was all part of the reporting.
[01:42:17] And then there was a time when they were just like, Hey, what do you want? Do you want claymores?
[01:42:23] I'm like, do I want claymores? Are you kidding me? Palates of C4. I have no, you know what I did?
[01:42:29] I, so we had engineers, the new task force of the army, platoon engineers, platoon attack,
[01:42:34] platoon infantry, let's go fight, you know, the global G.I.
[01:42:41] We, these engineers are brilliant. They're the intellects of the combat arms guys, right? They
[01:42:45] have the prescription glasses that are fashionable. You know what I mean? They're super smart and our
[01:42:51] 82nd engineers are great, but they're showing me like a Gatorade bottle. And they're like,
[01:42:56] All right, so we're going to put the C4 in the bottom and put some cardboard. And what do you
[01:43:01] got? Uh, links, uh, shell casings, whatever you have, that's the metal. We're going to put a timing
[01:43:09] doubt. Listen, debt cord, timing fuse. They're different, right? Okay. So I'm just there like,
[01:43:16] you know, writing all this down and no idea what the hell I'm doing. I'm like, well, these guys
[01:43:20] said I could use shell casings and links. Why don't I just throw bullets at these things? I mean,
[01:43:25] that would be a combat multiplier. It explodes and a bullet comes out. Wow. That is a horrible idea.
[01:43:33] That is a horrible idea. So now you got live rounds. It's like,
[01:43:37] you're also thrown on a bonfire too while we're at it. You know, just mindlessness.
[01:43:42] But at the same time, I remember these claymores. I had these claymores and I'm like, okay, the
[01:43:46] cord is way too short for a claymore. And so I'm like, I wanted to start 100 mile an hour taping
[01:43:52] claymores to IDs we found, right? Because I figured that'll be, you know, get in a ditch,
[01:43:59] clickety-clack and blow up the IDs. I mean, EOD was like the Easter Bunny. I mean, we heard it
[01:44:06] existed. No one's actually seen the Easter Bunny. It was like a Sasqua. When I saw Hurtlocker, I'm
[01:44:11] like, shut up. Where were those dudes? I've never seen an EOD, a robot, a guy in a suit. They're
[01:44:20] amazing. God bless them. But they were always EOD is here. You waited for two days for EOD to show
[01:44:26] up. And I'm like, I don't got time for this. Let me just show me enough. I'll blow it up myself.
[01:44:31] So I got my C4. I got my blasting cap. And then I got to crimp the blasting cap. And I'm like,
[01:44:39] crimp. When you say crimp, you mean what now? He's, oh, you crimped too hard. I'm like, I crimped too
[01:44:45] hard. He's like, just crimp it enough. I'm learning like, how many ticks do I need? How many should I,
[01:44:54] and so I'm getting myself some really, really stupid. I'm getting nervous over on this.
[01:44:58] It's so dumb. It's so dumb. And you teach it. It's like, give a monkey a hand grenade.
[01:45:05] And so we got to the point where I had these claymores and I thought, I've got all these alleyways.
[01:45:12] I'm going to spray paint the backs orange so I could see them. I'm going to take,
[01:45:20] I'm going to take a 100 mile an hour cord and I'm going to time to the top of buildings.
[01:45:26] So if a guy is coming through an alleyway, I'm not going to wait. I don't want to pull security in
[01:45:30] every alley on a building. It's like the Alamo. We got to defend ourselves. I'm just going to
[01:45:35] clack a claymore when a guy's running underneath it, right? Not realizing that the little prongs
[01:45:42] on the claymore are actually supposed to be in the ground for stability. So it's like a claymore.
[01:45:49] Then when you dangle it on cord, it's like, it's like, it's nighttime. So we're like,
[01:45:55] which way is it facing? So the first time, man, it happened and it's, that's like,
[01:46:03] you know, going to the zoo and you got that two hour window with a line is awake. You know what
[01:46:09] I mean? You're like super excited. You're like gathering the kids and like, hey, hey, hey,
[01:46:13] so when you hear that, like that the windbreaker pants and you just, you're like spidey sense.
[01:46:21] Everything's like, oh, this is real. This is happening here. They come,
[01:46:24] the bad guys come in and they come through the aisle and the alleyway. And I'm like, okay,
[01:46:29] okay. All right. Now it's like, do I hit it immediately? Do I wait? What's, you know, now
[01:46:35] you're nervous and you, but you're the NCO. So you're trying to be like, guys, let's not get
[01:46:39] nervous. But you're the one that's not enough. You're like, I'm my command, but it's just everyone
[01:46:44] okay? Everyone drinking? Everyone's good. How's home? Did you talk to mom? You know, they're like
[01:46:48] wasted time. I finally get the point. I'm like, all right, I'm ready. Go. And this thing just,
[01:46:54] I mean, there's 700 of those 32 calibers in that thing, 700. And that thing just went flying in
[01:47:04] the air. I mean, flying in the air, like it was, it could have taken the satellite out. It was the
[01:47:09] dumbest thing in the world. And it was like throwing a bomb in the air, just like launching,
[01:47:15] like spin decaying 40 millimeters right over your head. And they were like, what, what did you think
[01:47:21] was going to happen? But I thought it was just like, you know, like a top attack artillery
[01:47:27] round. But I'll tell you what, not only was that alarming for us, that guy must have shit his pants.
[01:47:35] I'm sure that guy's in dental school, changed his life around. He got out of there, went back to
[01:47:39] the Philippines and as a productive member. But no, you want to think outside the box,
[01:47:45] sometimes you get a little too much knowledge and it could burn you.
[01:47:48] Right. All right, let's get into, let's get into flusia a little bit.
[01:47:56] Now, so for this, I'm going to the book, House to House, and I'll tell you what,
[01:48:02] the arc of the writing and the thought process between these two books is amazing to see. So
[01:48:10] you you had written this one, it came out in 2007. Is that right? Right. So you'd written it maybe
[01:48:16] 2005, 2006, something like that. So you're fresh off the battlefield. And you're writing this book
[01:48:24] and it is an unbelievable account. It's really, it's just an unbelievable account of you and your
[01:48:31] guys. And then, you know, just to finish what I'm talking about, the way that arc goes into,
[01:48:36] remember the Ramrods, your new book, you can see how much you thought about it, how much,
[01:48:42] well, just the perspective of getting older and time and the way everything's impacted.
[01:48:48] And when you look back what it looks like now, but to be able to sit for me and read these two books
[01:48:57] and just see that arc is incredible. So for anybody that's listening, both books,
[01:49:03] they're both incredible books, get them. This is going to the book, it's House to House,
[01:49:09] an epic memoir of war. And you say this, I meet with Sims, Ewan and Fitz for a final briefing.
[01:49:19] We roll out the will roll out in the morning and our mission is now defined. Sims details
[01:49:22] the assault plan and explains our jobs with step by step precision. Each platoon will play a
[01:49:27] different part in the initial attack. Feluja is a city designed for siege warfare. And you talked
[01:49:32] about that earlier. Architecture aside, the insurgents have had months to prepare for this
[01:49:37] battle. They've dug fighting positions, mined the streets, booby trapped the houses, built bunkers
[01:49:42] and cleared fields of fire. Every road into the city is strong pointed mind and blocked with
[01:49:48] captured Texas barriers. Feluja is shaping up to be the veredune of the war on terror.
[01:49:54] We face a battle of attrition fought within a maze of interlocking fortresses.
[01:49:59] Attrition is such a sterile word. We'll be trading our lives for theirs. Sims makes it clear that our
[01:50:07] initial objectives will be heavily defended. The insurgents have deployed foreign fighters on the
[01:50:12] city's approaches. They form the outer crust of their defense in depth. So we'll face them first.
[01:50:18] Intelligence reports tell us that we'll face Syrians, Iranians, Saudis, Filipinos, even Italians
[01:50:25] and Chessians. They've they're well trained, ideologically motivated and armed with ample
[01:50:31] ammunition and equipment. They've trained for years to kill us infidels. Some have cut their
[01:50:37] teeth in Cheshna, Afghanistan and Somalia. They are veterans just like us, a regular Islamist
[01:50:44] all star team. We can expect possibly 30% attrition at an urban breach like this Sims tells us.
[01:50:52] I've been writing down everything Sims has said. Now I pause and stare at the initial casualty
[01:50:58] estimate 30% just to get into the city. There's no way we can keep everyone alive. Once inside the
[01:51:04] city, obviously we will we will not use the main roads. They are all heavily IED. Our lead tracks
[01:51:11] must create their own paths with help from the engineers. Look over the maps. We'll have to
[01:51:17] improvise most of these routes. I'm not going to rattle off with the acceptable attrition as according
[01:51:22] to command gentlemen, we'll seize highway 10 and push into the industrial district. Expect some of
[01:51:28] the heaviest fighting in this area. Foreign jihadists will use hit and run tactics, but there are
[01:51:34] enough fighters in the city for them to have a mobile reserve. We could face counterattacks
[01:51:39] during the first day. The enemy has the forces to mass against us. There will be no call to
[01:51:46] no calling in medivac chop choppers once you're in the city. It'll be too hot for blackhawks.
[01:51:51] We'll have to ground a vac our casualties to this clover leaf east of the cities.
[01:51:56] East of the city. End quote. The bad news continues as Captain Sims closes his laptop and turns to us.
[01:52:05] We expect the insurgents of stockpiled drugs will be facing fighters hopped up on dope again.
[01:52:11] I look over at Fitz and I know what he's thinking. If this is true, these guys are going to be hard
[01:52:19] to kill. So that is a freaking that is a that is a bout as a heart of a brief to sit there and listen
[01:52:30] to bunkers, IEDs, booby traps, interlocking fields of fire, strong pointed buildings. I mean, this
[01:52:38] is just for anybody that's not that hasn't been in the military that doesn't understand the the
[01:52:45] litany of enemy power that I just went through. You can't make it any worse.
[01:52:53] Not going to get any harder than what what I just read. Well, and the thing goes that it was that day
[01:52:58] was the first day that we realized we're actually going in. I mean, we thought that the Marines
[01:53:02] were going to do we had Iraqi intervention forces and Marines. And we were just on the flags, provide,
[01:53:08] you know, because it was the the the feign, the the the fake invasion. Seals had gone in on the
[01:53:15] day that we were taken down. Fallujah and took the hospital out. And once the hospital was isolated,
[01:53:20] there was a one road that connects intersex. Fallujah Highway 10, right? And so you've got a northern
[01:53:27] side, which is these homes are all like honeycombs on top of each other. South of Highway 10 is all
[01:53:32] industrial. So there's two completely different ways to do Mount and industrial as dangerous as
[01:53:39] as a living room because it's wide open. Anything can happen. But it was so crazy that
[01:53:46] he was giving us an attrition number. And then he was like, I'm not going to tell you what command
[01:53:50] is expecting. So we're starting to think this is a Normandy beach landing. This is the Higgins boats
[01:53:56] doors. You know, the ramp is very similar to a Bradley. The Higgins boats coming down and you're
[01:54:01] just going to get whatever if you can get to a foothold, hold it and let the Marines come through.
[01:54:07] And then it's on it's on them, right? That's that's pretty much the way we're looking at this. And I
[01:54:13] thought to myself, do I share that with my guys? Do I take that back to the platoon? Do there was
[01:54:20] a time early in the deployment? My platoon sergeant is a guy from Missouri who it's I mean,
[01:54:27] if you went to central casting to find a platoon sergeant, I write in the book House to House that
[01:54:33] he learned to kill anything that could shit outdoors at like four. If you if you took a dump
[01:54:39] outside, this guy could kill a game. Yeah. And he would send these deer videos. His mom would
[01:54:45] send him deer hunting videos and a deployment. And I started watching them. And there was a
[01:54:53] moment when a deer hunter will will will be like, hey, and the deer will be like, and and they'll
[01:54:59] take the shot. I was doing that to insurgents where you you couldn't get the shot you wanted
[01:55:05] and just be like, hey, and the guy would be like, whoa, and you just you'd pop them. And I'm like,
[01:55:10] this this works. This is incredible, you know. So he was he was always cool, always like,
[01:55:18] you know, I was a meatball. I thought my first name was Jesus. And my last name was Christ,
[01:55:23] because that's what he said before my name. There was no rank is just Jesus Christ, beloved.
[01:55:28] There was no doubt who was, you know, running this show. It was him. And I remember
[01:55:35] there was a day that he looked called me over to his Bradley, and he was smoking a cigarette.
[01:55:39] And he said, hey, look at me and his face was white. And he was like, I just got I've confirmed it
[01:55:45] three times. No time for bullshit. We've got 200 to 300 white hots coming through this palm
[01:55:54] grove. And they're expecting to be here in about 20 mics. And I was like, impossible. He's like,
[01:56:03] it's orbital platform. This is not a ground surveillance radar. This is orbital platform
[01:56:08] to track them right now. We've got 300 guys, QRF 20 minutes, fast movers 25. That's how much time
[01:56:16] you've got sustain this area for 25 minutes. And I'm like, this has got to be like a candid camera.
[01:56:22] You know, what am I going to do? How am I going to react? And I remember thinking, the guys always
[01:56:28] knew when the spare barrels came out, shit, it was going to be a bad day. When this when you had
[01:56:33] time to set up a T&E and have a spare barrel, it was going to be a bad one. But I thought, I'm not
[01:56:39] going to tell them. I'm not going to tell them. I'm going to prepare like the battle of NTM is
[01:56:46] going to break out. But we're just going to have our mags ready. We're going to have, I'm going to
[01:56:51] set this position up and, you know, we're knocking down. There was a guy's stacked flower up. There
[01:56:57] was like a four rows of flower bags. And I'm like, well, there's position one, right? And, you know,
[01:57:05] get elevation, low, high, ditches, whatever I could find a culvert here, a thing. And we waited,
[01:57:12] and we waited. And finally, the thing was like, Hey, I got the wrong 12 digit. The, you know,
[01:57:18] this is a guy relaying from a sheriff network in like, so someone else is getting, someone's
[01:57:25] getting messed up right now, but it's not you. And I thought to myself, like, that's an incredible
[01:57:30] lesson. Because you either train your guys and you're ready or you're not. Do how important is
[01:57:37] drama? And as a drama major, I can tell you that I'm not very good at it. But I can tell you that
[01:57:44] if you're doing it for the effect, because some leaders need that, this is going to be the worst
[01:57:50] day of a gentleman prepared to defend yourselves, right? That is, that's the line you want to have
[01:57:56] a John Wayne moment. Is that weakness? Is that strength? Do you really, if you're really doing
[01:58:03] your job, let 300 guys come. I'll eat chow. You give me 150 meters to standoff distance.
[01:58:12] And 30 seconds of warning, my guys can eat a burrito. And we're going to, we're going to hold
[01:58:18] this ground. That's what I want out of my force. That's what I want out of my guys. So I thought
[01:58:24] to myself, do I take that information back? And do I tell them, look around the room? Because
[01:58:29] you know that talk, you probably sat through a briefing, look around the room to your left and
[01:58:34] right. Not all of you will make it out of this meeting. You're like, well, everything's dramatic.
[01:58:40] Everything's life and death. And over time, it erodes trust. It erodes fidelity. It erodes swagger. So
[01:58:48] the one thing I wanted to be careful is with families. You know, the family running this group,
[01:58:54] it depends on what unit you're in. Families are all about gossip and you got groups of
[01:59:00] wives that are going to the range and like, you know, they know who's deploying, who's dead.
[01:59:05] It could be, if you don't have a command unit at home, willing to take these casualties and
[01:59:13] handling themselves as pros, you can have some real problems in a unit with just gossip and whatever.
[01:59:19] I hated the people that were calling home. I hated the distractions of bills and kids.
[01:59:28] And I tried as much as I could to just to get them away. I know there's Burger King at the other
[01:59:34] fob. Don't eat it. Don't eat it. I know there's a Pizza Hut at Warhorse and I know they have
[01:59:39] really good food and blue cheese. Don't eat it. I want you to be as miserable as possible,
[01:59:45] not because I hate you, not because I'm insecure and I want to show you my alpha. I want us all
[01:59:52] that when we eat blue cheese, damn it. When we have a whopper, it's going to be because
[01:59:56] there's no more fighting. You earned the whopper. I know your wife and your girlfriend want updates
[02:00:03] and the kids are riding bikes and sugar treating. I don't give a damn about any of that crap going
[02:00:09] on. And if you are thinking about your girlfriend or your wife or what's going on, is Jody coming
[02:00:15] over? What's happening? You are not in this game and you're no good to me. You're no good to me.
[02:00:22] Your focus is on that moose that's cleaning his body of hair, putting it in a bag and saying his
[02:00:29] prayer because he knows he's going to die. He knows he's going to die. When I came home from Iraq
[02:00:35] on leave, I met a Vietnam guy who was a tunnel rat. That's a shit job. That's like the worst
[02:00:41] job of the world, right? And I was complaining to him about how I was mad that the UPS man
[02:00:49] was whistling and happy. And we're going through all this mess. I could see these kids,
[02:00:56] grocery stores, guys and their girlfriends at the mall getting a latte and I'm like,
[02:01:01] these freaking turds. You have no respect. Do you have a limp? Are you stuttering? Why are you
[02:01:09] getting a haircut? Are you too good for your country? Who the hell did the... And I had an
[02:01:15] inferiority complex and this Vietnam vet looks at me and he says, you're going back in a week
[02:01:22] and you know what your problem is? And I'm like, what? He's like, you think you're coming back.
[02:01:28] And I was like, I didn't know what to do. I didn't have spit in my mouth. I didn't know if I should
[02:01:34] crawl into the fetal position or what do you mean? I don't know I'm coming back. He's like,
[02:01:39] no, no, no, no, no. In your head, you're not coming back. If you fight like you're coming back,
[02:01:45] you're going to not make the choices you need to make. You're going to always think about
[02:01:49] someone else. He's like, right now, close your eyes. Casually notification team is talking to
[02:01:55] your little boy. Your mom and dad just changed your star from blue to gold. Do you see it?
[02:02:01] All right, it's over. It's happening. That's your reality. Now, fight. Now, fight. Now, get out there
[02:02:10] and realize it's going to happen. You don't know when it's going to happen. It's going to happen in
[02:02:13] 62. A heart attack on a, you know, jungle gym with the grandkids. It's going to happen tomorrow
[02:02:18] with a bullet through your face. You don't control it. Give in to it. You're not coming back. Fight
[02:02:25] like you're not coming back and you will never lose an inch of ground and you'll never lose a
[02:02:31] soldier because you were afraid to not give them the fight you want. It changed my life. I'm like,
[02:02:36] is that what you, is that why you guys are all insane with your long hair and your weed, your
[02:02:41] wood stock? He's like, that's how we fought. That's how we survived. And that's the only way you can,
[02:02:46] you can make it through. And when I thought about that and I started to live that, I was like, all
[02:02:51] of these things are distractions. I want you to have a wonderful marriage. I want you to have a
[02:02:56] wonderful family, but you're not going to have any of those things. If you're thinking about Halloween
[02:03:02] and about that bike ride, we got to go take care of people that are going. And so we would watch
[02:03:08] Nicholas Berg, the beheading video. Every second of that guy getting his head cut off by Zarkawi
[02:03:16] in Fallujah. Let's watch beheading videos. Let's watch the people in the towers that jumped out
[02:03:23] the windows. The heat was too much. They jumped. That's what we're avenging. That's who we're fighting.
[02:03:30] Every one of these guys cut off Nick Berg's head. Every one of these guys is raping and destroying
[02:03:37] and they killed our citizens on September 11th. That's the mindset. I don't want to hear about
[02:03:42] your family. I don't want to hear about your wife. I don't want to hear about shit. Pay your bills.
[02:03:47] If you don't have a relationship that you can trust someone to pay the cable bill,
[02:03:51] I'm going to make this really easy for you. Re-enlist. Okay. Re-enlist because you're going to need
[02:03:56] the income. Right. We are here to do a job. This is our focus. Anything else is sedition.
[02:04:04] You are committing a crime to me. You're committing a crime to the country because you are here for a
[02:04:09] purpose and I don't give a shit about what your ambition or hope is. Right now it's us.
[02:04:15] I don't. My dad didn't. I didn't know my dad. You had a dad. I don't give a damn.
[02:04:19] We got all these different walks of life and socioeconomic issues. Focus. And that did it.
[02:04:25] That did it. And that's the best possible thing you can do for your troops. I think so. Help so.
[02:04:31] Help so. Hope so.
[02:04:36] Fast forward a little bit. Ramrod's taken me. He calls us into gravely in his gravely
[02:04:44] gravelly southern draw. There are times I think he's speaking a foreign language. His southern
[02:04:48] accent is so indiscernible. It's like a cross between John Wayne and Ross Perot.
[02:04:54] Our task force is known as the Ramrods. Those of us in Alpha Alpha company are the terminators.
[02:04:59] Alpha company forms a horseshoe around Sergeant Major Falkenberg.
[02:05:05] We get down on one knee and wait. At first he says nothing. He spits a wad of red man chewing
[02:05:10] tobacco into the dirt as his eyeball as he eyeballs us with a squint. He takes time to look
[02:05:16] each of us in the eyes. I stare back at him. To me he has always been a seemed as big as a
[02:05:21] grisly bear and twice as scary. But now as I study him I realize he's wiry and short.
[02:05:27] It's the weight of his character that makes him seem so large.
[02:05:31] Men, I could not be more proud of you if you were my own kids.
[02:05:37] We wait for him to continue. He hesitates. He's struggling with his emotions and we see his eyes
[02:05:43] missed up. That sight sends a surge of emotion through me. Part love, part despair, part blind
[02:05:50] loyalty. I couldn't be more proud looking at how far you all have come and what you are about to do.
[02:05:58] He pauses again and lowers his head. His iron self discipline fighting a losing battle with his heart.
[02:06:08] That's all. Go get him. The mechanics and support guys start to cheer. Somebody shouts give him hell.
[02:06:15] Others shout as well. For a moment I can't move. Sergeant Major Falkenberg is our father figure.
[02:06:22] He's the man I've most wanted to impress. I've wanted and needed to believe he was proud of me
[02:06:28] and what I'd done with my squad. I never felt I did anything to be worthy of my own father's pride.
[02:06:35] My father was the first person in the history of the state of New York to go from junior
[02:06:39] college to dental school starting with absolutely nothing and accomplishing so much on his own.
[02:06:43] I sought his affirmation but always seemingly in vain. I always felt I never quite measured up to his eyes.
[02:06:51] To me it was my fault for squandering so many chances. Here now I want more than anything to
[02:06:57] stand with Sergeant Major Falkenberg as we head into the fight and measure up at last.
[02:07:04] This time I am determined not to fail. His few words have had a more profound effect on me than
[02:07:09] any of the pep talks of the past week. A great speech is only partly about what is said. Often
[02:07:15] what matters more is who says it and how it is delivered. Our Sergeant Major's vulnerability
[02:07:21] and love for us spoke volumes. As everyone else gets up to head for their Bradleys I stay a heartbeat
[02:07:28] longer. Falkenberg turns his steel blue eyes to me. No words are spoken but in his eyes I can see
[02:07:36] something. A feeling coming my way. Respect.
[02:07:50] I gotta get you to read these books on a hot air man. It just sounds so much cooler here and you
[02:07:55] say it. Falkenberg is a guy who is, first of all he was 45 when he died. He was the first American
[02:08:04] to be killed in the battle of Fallujah. You want to talk about like you're watching a movie and the
[02:08:11] hero of the movie is the first guy to drop and there's no explanation. It's the most morale
[02:08:19] killing thing in the universe right? I remember hearing that he was 45 and I was thinking I'm
[02:08:25] 40. At the time I was the same age. He seemed like a dinosaur. Like that's the oldest person in
[02:08:30] the world you know and and and he is a body on the stretcher. He wasn't even big enough to cover the
[02:08:40] entire Polis litter and I the guy just was a giant and every you know always had the worst rifle.
[02:08:50] A you know an A4 with nothing on it. He's like let the fancy guys have the fancy shit. I don't need
[02:08:57] it. You don't need nothing. Iron sights. I just absolutely adored him and and and I always he
[02:09:08] hate I don't think he liked me and that's the other thing. No I really I could tell you with
[02:09:13] with authority that he did not like me but I had loved him and I and I and had he liked me
[02:09:22] I don't think I would have he was such a guy who's been in the military for 25 30 years. They've been
[02:09:30] to every armpit every butthole of the world. They've seen it all. There's nothing you're going to
[02:09:35] tell them that they don't know. On the day we show up to Fobb Normandy 4th Infantry Divisions on one
[02:09:40] side first IDs on the other are two battalions two-way two-two infantry which by the way is the
[02:09:46] order of march at Normandy Beach and ironically it took the first Infantry Division to take the
[02:09:52] battle. That's neither here nor there back in Normandy but they're first in Normandy first you
[02:09:57] know that's their unit. This fourth ID SAR major steps up and he is the most eloquent guy in the
[02:10:03] world. He's a gentleman on the other side of that water. There is an enemy that enemy will take your
[02:10:08] life. We are here learn from us. You know what I mean? Like it was they were dirty. Their uniforms
[02:10:16] were rat you know ripped and we were just I actually made noise. I starched my DCUs. I made like a
[02:10:25] totally combat ridiculous. You don't ever need that right and and Falkeberg gets up after this
[02:10:33] eloquent speech about you know the world is a dangerous place. We are the beacon of light and
[02:10:38] freedom and Falkeberg just turns to us doesn't talk to them and says don't trust a single one of
[02:10:45] those sons of bitches. He's like they're going to steal your night vision and go deer hunting with
[02:10:49] them. He's like they'll put your night vision they'll put in your gas tank. They're going to lie
[02:10:54] they're going to steal squad leaders. I want a green to green every five hours. I don't want a
[02:11:01] single 490 guy in your living quarters. I've seen this shit. They're your friends and then they
[02:11:06] steal all your gear and they go home to clean and they go deer hunting with your night vision
[02:11:11] and we're all like and the guy was everyone was like what the hell wrong with this guy right
[02:11:16] but that's who he was. He didn't give a shit if he was an elementary school principal he'd be the
[02:11:22] worst ever. He was an infantryman and he all he cared about was these are my kids these are my boys
[02:11:29] and the idea that he would be the first to go down and how that you want to talk about you know
[02:11:41] losing officers losing senior NCOs and these young kids saying okay I'm not a platoon sergeant anymore
[02:11:46] now I'm a first sergeant running a battalion a ROTC lieutenant running a company. I mean their
[02:11:53] trigger pulls away but that to me was the sign of you know this is real like we'd lost 40 plus guys
[02:12:02] to that point in the deployment every one of them stings every one of them hurts but he's much more
[02:12:08] than a leader. They become your mascot they become your empathy they're more than leaders they're
[02:12:16] the identity of who you are they're your validators every single day it's not a good day unless he
[02:12:21] says it's a good day you're not you know ready until he tells you you're ready and when that's
[02:12:28] gone it is a father figure it's it was devastating it was devastating and now you're not even in the
[02:12:36] fight yet like it'd be like you're going to the Normandy beach and the guy gets hit in the Higgins
[02:12:41] boat and now your the ramps are dropping and everyone's like what just and you're like forget it
[02:12:47] forget it everything's okay everything's cool we're keep going and and you get the report that
[02:12:55] there's an angel right that was the radio chatter an angel we got a ram ramrod seven
[02:13:02] angel seven you're like you know this well you know what let's go work our mission is to get
[02:13:11] get the guy that killed falkeberg that's what we're doing right now are you serious we're yes
[02:13:15] I got the mission the guys in this block killed sarmajor let's go get them it doesn't matter
[02:13:22] where we were in Bosnia we're getting the guys that got sarmajor falkeberg do not be the one
[02:13:29] to come home to a ceremony and see his widow and his daughters and say that you didn't have
[02:13:33] something to do with getting the person that got him that's the only thing we can control right now
[02:13:37] this is the last one we're gonna take right but it was you you don't know when to you you can only
[02:13:46] compartmentalize so much and so these two books are dealing with 20 years after that and did we
[02:13:53] maintain our promises to our friends did we sit down with the kids we all talk about it
[02:13:59] when you're old enough I'm gonna sit down with you I'm gonna tell you who your dad was
[02:14:02] how many of us have actually done that how many of us have actually stood with a widow
[02:14:09] I would hear a story of a woman that lost her husband in the war and she got married again
[02:14:13] I thought to myself that's way too soon that's disrespectful like how do you do that you your
[02:14:22] husband you loved him he loved you talked about you all the time and you just got to marry another guy
[02:14:27] and someone told me he was like Bellevue that was 12 years ago man 12 years ago let this woman
[02:14:35] move on with her life you're holding on you have no idea what she's been through you have no idea
[02:14:42] who this guy is you can't think like that this is these families have gone through so much and we
[02:14:51] promised that we would be there have we been there what kind of lives have we lived we said we were
[02:14:59] gonna live for them and be twice as good because they're not here we have to do more with our lives
[02:15:05] how many have done that instead we're talking about suicide and addiction and and how people have
[02:15:12] quit there's no way you're thinking about your buddy that died in the war if you're thinking about
[02:15:17] you know killing yourself getting high or or giving up you are betraying all of that we we've
[02:15:27] been far too soft with this generation of saying oh it's acceptable that's a choice you're making
[02:15:32] a choice it's a valid choice it's bullshit it's not a valid choice you you made a promise and
[02:15:39] it and if you would have killed yourself as we're stacking on a house how would that have been received
[02:15:47] but no you decide you're gonna do it at home when it's over no no we have a purpose and we have to
[02:15:54] honor our word and this book is about how I didn't I didn't and it took a stupid this award
[02:16:02] that got all my guys together again and we realized we don't need any of the stories we don't need the
[02:16:10] glory we don't need the attention we need each other that's why we did it we need each other we
[02:16:15] need to be present in each other's lives and validate and and acknowledge that there's purpose
[02:16:22] and that and that we all have we all have a journey and some of us are struggling some are doing great
[02:16:29] but we we got to honor those promises we made each other when when we thought the world was going to end in 24 hours
[02:16:43] at this point I'm gonna fast forward a little bit it's basically go time and there's a I kind of
[02:16:51] have to read this part because we get a new character gets introduced into the scenario here you say
[02:16:56] this throughout alpha company digital cameras appear and soon the men are posing for one another
[02:17:01] nearby are embedded reporters take all take all this in they cluster together like new kids in
[02:17:07] second grade watching the scene as awkward outsiders these photos are crucially important a form of
[02:17:12] insurance against our own mortality a few months back we lost a man and realized to our unending
[02:17:18] dismay that no one had a single photo of him to display at his memorial service it was disgraceful
[02:17:24] surely this is in the back of everyone's mind now this time we will have a record of every soul
[02:17:30] who goes through the breach Michael Ware breaks ranks from the cluster of journalists with Yuri
[02:17:36] in tow they come over to third platoon and offer to take our picture the platoon lines up and they
[02:17:42] go to work the other embeds see this and promptly stream to their assigned units taking cameras and
[02:17:48] snapping pictures of them as they click away they are no longer awkward outsiders now they're
[02:17:53] now they found a way to help us they circulate among the soldiers and start to fit in they've
[02:17:58] shown us they're human and the company appreciates that after Michael and Yuri finest finally finish
[02:18:03] up I light a smoke and stretch out on the ground next to the track it's almost 0900 the morning is
[02:18:08] crisp cold and punctuated by distant artillery barrages every few minutes and Apache funders
[02:18:14] overhead fast moving fighter jets crisscross above them in the sky this is where I belong
[02:18:21] it's the first time in my life that I've found my place it's a reassuring thought that eases some
[02:18:26] of the butterflies fluttering around in my gut I wonder if it was like this for the soldiers of
[02:18:32] the Union Army during the Civil War tenting on the old campground and all quiet on the
[02:18:37] Potomac have been replaced by our percussion heavy metal modern riffs of mud vein and dope but we're
[02:18:44] still basically the same the details vary from war to war but no matter the epoch or the
[02:18:49] war but no matter the epoch the camaraderie remains it is a closeness that no civilian will ever really
[02:18:56] understand a Bradley swings out of the column and starts towards us lieutenant curl new all
[02:19:02] riding shotgun in the turret yells at the troops as he passes he looks like Patton must have looked
[02:19:08] as he raced alongside one of his flying columns in a jeep dressed like he was ready for a parade
[02:19:13] Patton sometimes stood on the passenger seat to shout at his G eyes new all can't do that in a
[02:19:19] modern day Bradley fighting vehicle but the similarities are striking nonetheless our task
[02:19:24] force is a hundred vehicles long strong new all's track runs the length of our column like a steel
[02:19:30] sheep dog shepherding us forward as he passes by I hear him bellow let's go go go so you got Michael
[02:19:44] Ware who's Australian journalist Yuri's the other guy that I mentioned where's he from
[02:19:51] Russian guy yeah and he these guys are in beds and how much did you know about Michael Ware at
[02:19:57] this when you first met him so Michael Ware was in my opinion Michael Ware was a public enemy
[02:20:03] number one because he was the face of Western journalism to the terrorists so all these beheading
[02:20:10] videos they were trying to basically circulate through him he was embedding with both sides
[02:20:17] and so I didn't know what a journalist did and I didn't really give a damn but he when he showed up
[02:20:22] I mean really I mean what am I he showed up and he was Time Magazine you know CNN all these
[02:20:29] things were going to work through him and he had the respect of being the guy that has gone to every
[02:20:35] horrible place in the world and so I didn't see him I saw him as a partisan I saw him he has an
[02:20:41] agenda what I learned in flu and one of the reasons why I became an embedded reporter when I got out
[02:20:47] was because I had such I mean I grew so close to respecting this guy because at a certain point
[02:20:55] our radios are only as good as what they're you know I can't get on the horn at my rank and level
[02:21:00] and talk to a general in the Marine Corps that's on a flank five kilometers away he would pick up a
[02:21:06] sad phone and he called the embedded journalist with the Marines and he'd be like listen we need
[02:21:12] artillery and we need it now I'd be like damn like that welcome welcome to Team America Michael Ware
[02:21:21] no he was doing things and then he sat us down and gave us his own briefing and and that that
[02:21:29] changed the that changed the way we fought listen you know you get command and they tell you dispositions
[02:21:35] and you know I always it's gross to say but when you saw an enemy defecate you could learn a whole
[02:21:43] lot about what you're fighting you know diarrhea is a good good sign these guys are nervous they're
[02:21:50] not healthy they're not they're tired they're not you could see the mucus I want that right I don't
[02:21:57] I mean I want to see that right give me more diarrhea I want I want to see the enemy suffering
[02:22:04] and scared and not healthy right Michael Ware gave us a briefing on what type of enemy we're fighting
[02:22:11] and and the way that these guys you know they're rocket teams he's like you're gonna look for
[02:22:16] little designations one building is gonna have nothing but rockets in it the next building
[02:22:21] nothing but medical supplies the next building just bullets if you start fracking out like you're
[02:22:26] doing you're gonna get the wrong building and that whole thing is gonna go up he's like look
[02:22:30] they've read your your books they know how you like to enter buildings we would go into a building
[02:22:37] on the top floor all the stairs were removed all of them you would jump from a roof to another
[02:22:44] roof and they took out not only the roof but the second story as well you're falling all the way
[02:22:49] down to the first floor and they've got you know these rods and glass and a costa tina wire he's
[02:22:57] like you you there's gotta be a way that you you acknowledge that if you're coming from the road
[02:23:03] and you're going through a front door they know you're gonna take that door right that's the door
[02:23:08] they want you to take you would find serpentine like almost like a maze of just really crudely
[02:23:15] put together cinder blocks maybe eight feet tall and they would just work you into a turn in a turn
[02:23:22] and then you look up and that's the overhead where that pkm is mounted and they're just gonna fire at
[02:23:28] you while you're like a rat in a maze he's like this they've had way too much time to prepare
[02:23:34] he's like tunnel networks they know they have to protect their wires and and if they leave their
[02:23:41] wires in the open there's too much artillery and bombs out there they're gonna cut those wires all
[02:23:44] of those wires are gonna be dug all of them so when you see a hole and a wire coming out it's
[02:23:50] leading to a house I've seen it and I know what these guys are doing I'm like this is this is
[02:23:56] intel this is really good stuff and this is a guy who did not care about being famous he didn't
[02:24:06] care about being on camera he was he was just about wherever you're going I'm going and I want to
[02:24:13] get the story so I can I can tell the truth and that's why he was hanging out with the enemy
[02:24:19] you want to know the truth who are these people where they coming from I I love that guy I don't
[02:24:25] think if he didn't film that house fight there's no way that this this award would have happened
[02:24:31] I don't think it it was 15 years the the video and his documentary and it circulating gave our
[02:24:40] unit credibility gave that award credibility I mean we hear a lot of stories you know unless
[02:24:46] you see it or hear it you know yeah totally I mean the the Chapman story is so unbelievable
[02:24:55] that had I not seen a drone footage myself that is one of the most incredible things
[02:25:00] any American has ever done in the history of warfare the Roberts Ridge and and they're what
[02:25:08] they knew that the birds getting shot down the the seals working with Air Force and
[02:25:17] again sometimes you know those things help just kind of paint the picture a little bit better but
[02:25:23] Michael Ware had no business going into any house fight he had no business doing any of that and he
[02:25:28] did it and I just I he's like family to me now I love him I I just I I don't know I've never had
[02:25:37] a relationship with a person outside of uniform that I can actually say I tell him now you're
[02:25:43] you were born in the wrong job you you you should have had a rifle not a cannon there was a
[02:25:52] part in Fallujah where I thought about giving him a rifle and the only reason why I didn't
[02:25:58] was I couldn't imagine what that report would look like if my guy got shot because he
[02:26:04] you know knotted up I don't know I don't think I would have survived that and that documentary is
[02:26:11] called only only the dead yeah yeah I remember when it came out because somebody you know forwarded
[02:26:17] to me like hey this dude's freaking with the moosh hey this dude's doing this dude's with moosh in
[02:26:22] Ramadi I'm like what sorry like what are you talking about and when watched it it's it's
[02:26:28] crazy to watch it's crazy it's crazy to watch it's crazy to watch he's he's yeah at some points
[02:26:33] he's embedded with Americans and at some points he's embedded with moosh and it's crazy to watch
[02:26:39] and see and and then you know there's a story behind it but yeah it's a it's a crazy documentary
[02:26:45] he's a he's a lunatic yeah I know I love him I'm not a there's Valor that we show if people
[02:26:51] fight cancer show Valor people stand up to bullies show Valor soldiers cops firemen and I I never
[02:26:59] thought journalists could do that every time I hear a journalist being so brave you know you had the
[02:27:05] you know you read a teleprompter you know I'm saying you went to makeup and got your hair done
[02:27:10] excuse me if I don't celebrate the holiday you know I might just go to work today instead of
[02:27:16] having wolf blitzer day but the truth is there are guys out there and girls that a woman from
[02:27:24] CNN in the Afghanistan what's her name the the the lady that was bedded don't she's
[02:27:32] she's a real deal yeah no I've had a woman on this podcast Holly McKay and she's gone over and
[02:27:37] done all kinds of stuff where I'm like hey she's like on social media like messaging I'm sending
[02:27:42] you know like messages get out of there we like Afghanistan was falling I was trying to pass messages
[02:27:48] like you need to get out of there now but you know she's committed to doing her job yeah that's weird
[02:27:56] man the video of this I don't know what to tell people read the book for this is my this is my
[02:28:03] advice don't watch the video yet read the book house to house spend a few hours it probably take
[02:28:10] you seven or eight hours to read this book read this book and you'll kind of be like
[02:28:14] well that seemed crazy but you know could it have really happened like that you'll
[02:28:21] kind you're gonna have questions in your mind all right and then you go watch the video and
[02:28:24] you're like holy shit so that's my advice read the book and then go watch the video because
[02:28:30] there's a video that's just you know you watch the documentary for sure but it's it's crazy that he
[02:28:37] was there to capture this on video it's crazy there's a point in the video he doesn't mention
[02:28:41] this but there's a point where I took a shot at him and he's got the camera and I you know
[02:28:48] people think that you know you you in a close quarter fight you lose your hearing you can't
[02:28:53] hear anything anymore you're just exchanging gunfire for you're totally deaf and this dude is like
[02:28:59] hey you know in the middle of a dark house he's a gay with a Australian accent and he's like hey
[02:29:05] hey that's the journalist and I'm like dude I'm gonna who the f is I'm gonna blow your head off
[02:29:13] you know why are you speaking English and I took a shot and he just let the round like hits the side
[02:29:19] and he's just like and he's right back and for years I thought he just put the camera down
[02:29:26] I thought he just put the camera down the house and left and he and I was doing a
[02:29:31] doing a radio show and I said that and he the first time he contacted me since the military
[02:29:37] he's like you son of a bitch I was in the house with you the whole time I have the entire video
[02:29:41] and I watched this documentary and the first reaction you have is I was way cooler than that
[02:29:48] you know what I mean like in your own head you you hear yourself screaming and it's like I can't
[02:29:56] can't believe how scared I sounded and then you realize I was scared you know what I mean like
[02:30:02] you you seriously like you hear a story the army loves to you know they will they want their guys
[02:30:10] this is the version this is what happened very clinical very sterile it all happened within
[02:30:15] two seconds that video is 29 minutes long and in totality I would have told you that that
[02:30:21] entire fight was two minutes long that's way too much of just and and maybe we block you know
[02:30:30] when you go through something you forget about it or you don't think about it or you can't remember
[02:30:34] it or you don't want to remember it but all I can remember is these it was so dark that you just
[02:30:41] think it's the same guy you know and you you just you're not you're bleeding you're not bleeding
[02:30:48] the 556 almost cauterizes you don't get the the you can't drive if you're not hitting pelvis or
[02:30:56] someone in the face they're moving you know and so you you you're not getting stopping power
[02:31:03] and and and the other thing that that was so strange is that like you don't know where your
[02:31:09] guys are and so you're constantly you know thinking that you're going to get into a spot
[02:31:17] and these guys are going to frag out or just start juicing because you know you trained them to do
[02:31:21] you trained them to err on the side of area fire at all times they're going to go through a
[02:31:28] spendex in here with 240s and m249 saws and 40 millimeters and I don't want to be on the receiving
[02:31:35] end of that so how do I just get out but and then it gets personal and the moment it becomes personal
[02:31:43] is the moment where you go through so many in a close quarter battle it's well you know it's
[02:31:49] strength it's will it's you know spirit it's what you're fighting for your country your friends your
[02:31:56] family it all it's the most schizophrenic experience that anything can turn that battle
[02:32:03] and I've never been in an octagon I've never been you know but if there's something you can do
[02:32:09] that can intimidate me in that 30 second window or however long it is in a in a MMA match I at
[02:32:19] least dominated you enough where I could do something and and I got you thinking psychologically
[02:32:26] I've got you thinking and sometimes it's just registering that the guy that you're fighting
[02:32:31] against is scared of you right and there was a moment so the housefight is really three
[02:32:37] different fights right you got the we walk in we get ambushed and then the tough the the thing that
[02:32:44] caused me the most thinking was just to stand in a doorway with a saw that was the nuttiest
[02:32:51] that because you that's you don't know it's unknown are there two or there one is there
[02:32:56] what is it it's all unknown you've never seen the house before and I remember I hooked my finger
[02:33:02] to the second knuckle I mean we're butterflies you know this is the training that in the military
[02:33:09] it's just I'm the second and I I hooked it because I'm like if I go down this thing's
[02:33:16] going to keep firing right and then I have a runaway and the only time I've had a runaway
[02:33:23] is on the range and you point them you point the machine gun down range and break a link
[02:33:27] and I'm about to do that and I think wait a minute this is actually this is actually we'll take it
[02:33:34] but that thing fires a lot around and now I'm in this unenviable position of hoping the people
[02:33:42] that designed the saw uh fn uh what was it yeah fn the fn people have fixed that magazine
[02:33:51] issue where you could put a m4 magazine head and they have they still so so I'm trying to feed a
[02:33:59] magazine to get a magazine get a little 30 rounds do whatever and I realize that not only are these
[02:34:04] guys talking to so that they had a room that had a stairwell going up and a jersey barrier coming
[02:34:09] out and I thought there were two machine guns the army has their own version I guess it was a pkm
[02:34:17] and an ak excuse me for you know thinking that pkm those two feet away sounded like two yeah
[02:34:25] it was a pom pom gun in my mind but as the juice in that door um the platoon gets on one side I'm
[02:34:34] the other guy on the other side but I'm in that I'm on the stairwell now and I'm looking over
[02:34:38] and I got nothing left and I just remember them talking to each other and I did not even wound
[02:34:45] them and for 200 rounds at like three feet that just took everything I had my mojo was done so I
[02:34:53] start beating tail and as I'm running out I just feel the heat and the tracers behind me and I'm
[02:35:03] like I'm running out I felt like I was in that house with those two guys again like I'm running
[02:35:08] I've never broken contact in my life and I'm breaking contact and someone just grabs my age
[02:35:14] harnesses I leave the courtyard it just pulls me like a rag doll and I was just like that's it and
[02:35:21] then we're taking fire from the roof so so let me just get through this um how this just to
[02:35:28] just to clarify for everybody so you guys enter this house yeah and you there's I mean just think
[02:35:33] about what you just said there's a jersey barrier meaning that the moosh had brought freaking concrete
[02:35:40] barriers like a jersey there like you see on the highway they had it up the stairs no it was
[02:35:46] underneath the stairwell so underneath the stairwell they have a jersey barrier to like they built
[02:35:50] a bunker inside this house this is what you guys are up against they've got so your your your team's
[02:35:56] in there and now they're engaging and your your team is pretty much stuck right they're pinned down
[02:36:03] they can't get out of this house right and you're standing there and you realize that somebody's got
[02:36:10] to put down some cover fire so everyone can get the hell out of there right so you got our machine
[02:36:15] gunners are outside and they're firing at guys in a kitchen and these are two young kids Joe Swanson
[02:36:22] James and McDaniel they have 240 bravos which is the m60 version today and they're firing their
[02:36:28] machine guns into the house the bad guys are shooting from this entryway into a living room
[02:36:34] and the walls are falling apart and so you've got and again it's like throwing a log on a on a fire
[02:36:41] you've got the rounds just going everywhere you can't get up you're out you're literally hugging
[02:36:47] ground and you can't get up and so I just kind of rolled to the left side of the room and the
[02:36:52] entire platoon was on the right and I remember trying to squeeze my rifle and it just it there
[02:36:58] was something in the trigger well and around it hit the the magazine well and that popped the
[02:37:06] magazine open with the spring and the bolt was I thought it was a double feed but the rifle was
[02:37:14] in op there's no way I could I could do it so I just said throw me a machine gun give me a saw
[02:37:21] and someone slit a saw over and that's one of those things where you ask for like
[02:37:25] you know I'll help you lift the couch and then the couch is 500 miles and you're like yeah I need
[02:37:29] help with it the the saw came over and it was um it was ready to go and I just I needed time
[02:37:38] I needed time like I my legs were like you know lactic acid and just concrete they wouldn't move
[02:37:48] and it it just like you're just like this is it like this is it it's gonna and so my whole
[02:37:55] thought process was get low suck up as many rounds as you can in the sampler plate in the helmet
[02:38:01] and if they're gonna hit you they'll hit your leg or they'll hit your you know your your arms but
[02:38:06] just bring bring those arms duck walk in as low as you can and just try to get well-aimed fire to
[02:38:14] keep their heads down and just kill these guys walk right into the bunker they'll never expect that
[02:38:21] just walk right in and it just ran away as soon as I pulled the trigger it was just for clarity
[02:38:27] what does that mean when you had a runaway so open bolt weapons close bolt you know the
[02:38:33] like a machine gun we train people for three second bursts right so you just as long as you pull
[02:38:38] that trigger down an automatic weapon it's gonna fire rounds as long as that trigger is depressed
[02:38:43] the semi you got to squeeze every time when I pulled it down I chewed up so many rounds that the
[02:38:50] automatic machine gun just was seared and that was just firing the rounds regardless of where my
[02:38:57] finger was so you pulled the trigger and it keeps shooting and it just gonna stop so in a training
[02:39:03] situation when you're talking about breaking or or it could be in a combat situation but once it's
[02:39:08] running away meaning you'd let you off the trigger and it's just bullets are still flying
[02:39:12] one of the things that you can do is you take the you grab the belt of the machine gun the all
[02:39:17] the bullets and you break it off and then it will only shoot however many are left and then it stops
[02:39:23] and you know he had to make the decision well should I break this off oh no wait a second this
[02:39:28] is a good thing it's working yeah we'll take it it's basically the same thing happened to Alec Baldwin
[02:39:34] I'm kidding too soon no too soon no but when it's a really it's a really weird feeling but you think
[02:39:39] in in a you know in a combat situation use it right just point it but the problem is that that's a
[02:39:46] 200 round it's a drum a hard plastic drum and there's 200 rounds and you don't realize how fast
[02:39:54] those rounds are gone because once the rounds are gone I don't have any more linked ammo I'm not a
[02:40:00] sawgunner I'm hoping that these guys are just gonna get out we have a day these guys have the
[02:40:08] Australian peel many times a special operative trades a grunt you get things you don't know
[02:40:14] so I learned Australian peel because but I'm never gonna learn I'm never gonna use it because I'm a
[02:40:19] an elite American infantryman I don't break context right as the first time we did it
[02:40:25] and it's basically like look I'm gonna go forward you're gonna get out so I got the gun I'm gonna
[02:40:31] move in you're just gonna and I just need to know last man the last guy just has to get a last man so
[02:40:37] I know everyone's out and then I'm gonna go with them I'm gonna fire everything I have and and run
[02:40:43] away and we're breaking contact and I I don't hear last man the gun's going crazy and I'm walking
[02:40:51] on the stairs above the the the little bunker and I'm just kind of trying to bend you know like it's
[02:40:57] a leaf blower like just trying to like get it in there and if nothing's happened it was a disaster
[02:41:02] it was pretty bad uh but that's on tape you know like it's like crazy could you have not put that
[02:41:09] part in like it would be great if only the cool parts were in there but unfortunately yeah everything
[02:41:16] you say uh I mean as you're writing about this it's crazy to read about it uh the trigger
[02:41:25] still depressed my mind races I've suppressed the enemy now I should kill them my heart urges me
[02:41:29] forward against the stairwell get out of there clear the room and juice these guys I try to step
[02:41:34] forward but my feet won't let me my legs feel like they're chained to the floor I can't advance the
[02:41:38] 10 feet needed to end the fight don't be a bitch move forward I strain against my own body I cannot
[02:41:44] move the saws bolt clacks back and forth as it chews through my ammo supply okay I probably have
[02:41:50] about 110 rounds left what if I make a push to get on the stairs no my body still refuses my heart
[02:41:56] rages I see the saw along the barriers more foam explodes out to the escape cascade on the floor
[02:42:03] it looks like snowfall in hell in the firelit gloom okay I've got probably less than 100 rounds left
[02:42:10] it's time to move get forward finish this finish this now I push I swear my legs won't budge the
[02:42:17] enemy remains unhurt hiding behind the ripped up barriers I can't do it my heart seeds with contempt
[02:42:24] then my saw runs away from me sometimes with that weapon once you go cyclic you can't stop a stop it
[02:42:30] I ease off the trigger but it remains locked back the bolt charges on its own the gun spews at least
[02:42:35] 50 more rounds then clunks on an empty chamber I'm out of ammunition I'm still in the stairwell
[02:42:41] room any second the fuckers under the stairs will pop their heads back up see that I'm an open target
[02:42:47] and finish me my legs suddenly free up I've got to get out run I spin right and bolt through the
[02:42:53] doorway thinking McDaniel is 240 will be in the four-year to cover my escape I don't see Misa
[02:42:59] anywhere but both of the living room and the four-year are completely empty I charge through
[02:43:05] both and out the front door as I fly into the courtyard an automatic weapon clatters give me
[02:43:10] another automatic weapon I scream still standing in the courtyard yo pull back Fitz yells I need 203
[02:43:16] is give me some 203 fire bullets crack over my left shoulder and hit the outer wall in front of me
[02:43:21] I keep running my legs pumping furiously and then I'm through the gate and with my men Misa appears
[02:43:28] at the gate and throws me to the side uh outside the street I got you man you're good we're safe
[02:43:37] so you get out of the house yeah I mean honestly that was pretty I think it was the angle of the
[02:43:47] of the house didn't you know the guy down the stairwell can only hit you when you're in the house
[02:43:51] and the guys from the window had to have either moved away from that vantage point because if
[02:43:56] they were hitting you know McDaniel Swanson were right outside with a couple other guys
[02:44:02] and they were exchanging machine gun fire at point blank range if those guys were there
[02:44:08] with the ammo that they had I mean it would have been too easy there were pillars in front as well
[02:44:14] but for some reason it was I wasn't efficient a barrel for him but I could feel it and I and
[02:44:22] and what was so crazy is that you know I'm just thinking to myself my dream you know like when
[02:44:28] you're at that two mile point in a run and you hit the wall and your legs just everything is
[02:44:35] you you run so hard that you can't feel anything the adrenaline is just going nuts but you're like
[02:44:40] I eventually have to stop and when you have to stop in that moment it's a it's a you can't just
[02:44:47] stop out of dime you got to at least walk it out after you hit the wall I mean I went from zero to
[02:44:53] 60 and I was I felt my butt cheeks I thought I got hit in the in the in the ass and I I think it was
[02:45:02] my heels like I mean kicking my own ass like I had muscle spasms you know what I mean like like I
[02:45:12] Charlie horse just from nothing to full sprint in a fight or flight and I had soreness like on the
[02:45:19] back of my hamstring and my quads and my glute now it was just like in my head what happened
[02:45:27] and the and the real the realization that I did nothing to the enemy at least if I got two if I
[02:45:36] got one let's get the bomb and and the problem with Fallujah is that the bombs became like a butcher
[02:45:43] shop you know you got a big set play you got like three fixed wing and I'm like I need a bomb okay
[02:45:51] here's what's going to happen for your bomb mr I need a bomb all artillery stops all the aviation
[02:45:58] assets are gone you're getting your bomb it better be important and your number is 15 because
[02:46:04] 14 other guys need a bomb mr dmv you know I need my license done now and you are on a list
[02:46:12] and if you don't have a radio you don't have a rank you're not getting a bomb so we asked for the bomb
[02:46:18] I wanted the bomb didn't get the bomb but now I'm on the street with the platoon and everyone is ducking
[02:46:24] for cover and it was just such a horrific feeling of I can't I mean I would have told you that that
[02:46:31] moment in my life was the moment I was born to have and it never in my mind ended with me running
[02:46:39] screaming with nothing with no dent in in Goliath's armor it's just it was crazy like I can't believe
[02:46:50] nothing happened now that being said yeah a normal human being would be like well thank god I got out
[02:46:58] of there and everyone in my platoon is okay cool um okay let me check what happened all right normal
[02:47:05] human being what would happen if you were in front of your men that you care for love and
[02:47:11] everything else and then you start giving orders and they're like no sir I'm listening to him right
[02:47:19] that's what they did okay and that just pissed me off I lost it I went from I can't believe
[02:47:27] this is happening to f this yeah you you guys want to listen to fits you guys want to listen to
[02:47:34] Lawson what get we couldn't get accountability is someone in the house is anyone dead do you
[02:47:41] have all your equipment I couldn't get anything everyone was scattered from still getting shot at
[02:47:47] so fits and Lawson did what we are trained to do which is break contact to another building set up
[02:47:54] fire superiority get elevation eyes on suppress and then consolidate come up with a new plan
[02:48:00] that's a normal plan that's a normal plan that's a normal plan I had Michael where and I he claims
[02:48:07] that I'm pacing the streets like a lunatic I don't remember that but I do remember looking at Michael
[02:48:13] where and I just looked at him and he looked at me he looked exhausted sweaty and he was just like
[02:48:22] I felt like he was telling me you could do this absolutely there's two guys in the house go you're
[02:48:29] good for two you're out there you know thinking yourself are you writing the book like what what
[02:48:34] the hell kind of example that I just said exactly then you start with give me my fucking rifle who
[02:48:39] has my fucking rifle which is which is classic right you you know thrown your rifle to somebody
[02:48:46] else you took the saw and and you're like getting more pissed off yeah by the minute but but in my
[02:49:01] head I was telling my guys what to do and they were not listening I was internalizing that is
[02:49:08] Belavia shook big Sarge is not the same guy he's scared he just ran like a little bitch
[02:49:19] I want I'm gonna look at loss and fits these guys are cool calm collected like they are all the time
[02:49:26] right and that and I was just like you all right all right like is that what you think I wasn't
[02:49:32] there's no rational you're not you're emotional and and and adrenaline's going crazy and the only guy
[02:49:39] that I can get any you know my my dr. Phil is an Australian from Time Magazine
[02:49:47] and he's like I'm not going any and the bullets are listen I don't know what's happening to me I
[02:49:51] can't see me I could see him and there are bullets all around him just ping-pong ping and he was just
[02:49:58] like standing there so I'm like this guy there's a death wish or he really believes that I can do this
[02:50:06] and if he believes I can do it that's all I need and so I was like let's come up with a plan
[02:50:14] and my plan was a bomb I need a bomb right now you get some Bradleys up there yeah uh
[02:50:20] Cantrell's back Bradley lumbers up the street the platoon scatters as the brat arrives some
[02:50:26] some get behind it for cover the turret traverses his gun barks the shell explode the shells explode
[02:50:33] high into the side into the kitchen and living room uh undershir is that right I would say yeah
[02:50:39] undershir walks his fire back and forth seesong between the two rooms he pauses his cantrell
[02:50:44] sweeps the track free of the shell casings which tumble hot into the smoking street
[02:50:50] cantrell backs the brat up to up the street to where he can lay down a curtain of fire on the
[02:50:54] rooftops most of the shells go high but the incoming shot sees for the moment anyways what
[02:50:59] else you got you think we got him cantrell asks Michael where here's the question over the din of
[02:51:05] the brads engine shots he shouts there's no way he's got him sergeant bell there's no way where
[02:51:12] had been in the courtyard when the shit hit the fan he had to dodge the machine gun fire from the
[02:51:17] kitchen in my heart I know he's right but at the same time there's no point in wasting any more
[02:51:21] ammunition the brat just can't get a kill shot into the house at best the barrage drove the
[02:51:26] insurgents away from the front windows overlooking the courtyard I think we're good I tell the brat
[02:51:31] crew we're back to square one I start to pace again walking back and forth my inner monologue
[02:51:36] spills out of my mouth I'm talking to myself in front of where in front of the men I'm livid the
[02:51:41] whole situation has taken my dignity I need to find the strength to get it back honor what an
[02:51:47] overused word it's an abstraction who can define it all year in Iraq I've stood with my men if they
[02:51:53] had to fill sandbags until three in the morning I'd be out there in the dirt mud with them I would
[02:51:58] never give an order then go relax as they worked my example is all I have as a non-commissioned officer
[02:52:04] I take pride in that that is my honor I've always told my men not to be afraid in combat when the
[02:52:10] bullets start flying they need to man up and dish it back tenfold how many times have I drilled this
[02:52:15] into them perhaps telling them to be unafraid is unrealistic we're all human fear walks with us in
[02:52:21] every battle yet we cannot allow fear to dictate us who we are and how we act we cannot let it
[02:52:27] control us we must master it that is another essential element of honor as I storm around in
[02:52:34] the street struggling with myself where regards me curiously the last thing I want right now is a
[02:52:39] journalist watching me grapple with my own demons I turn away and pace back up the street slipping on
[02:52:44] a couple of 25 millimeter shell casings in the process another spray of sparks flares around me
[02:52:51] do I have the balls do I have the nuts to do what my fucking heart wants me to do if I don't go in
[02:52:57] they'll have won how many times have we heard that American soldiers rely on firepower and
[02:53:02] technology because they lack courage how many times has our enemy said that man for man they can
[02:53:08] beat us that's nothing new the Germans and the Japanese said the same thing during world war two
[02:53:12] inside that house I surrendered my honor and my manhood now I have to take both back or live
[02:53:19] with the fact that they are right about me that is unacceptable I rant and swear with abandon
[02:53:26] down the street I see sergeant nap taking care of my men like they are his little brothers
[02:53:30] I want to cry I'm so proud I love these kids in a way I will never be able to express I see their
[02:53:36] faces one by one John Ruiz Lucas Abernathy Peter Sokolas Alex Stuckart Victor Santos Brett Pully
[02:53:46] Tristan Maxfield they deserve more from me I stopped pacing and let out a deep rattling sigh
[02:53:54] only where remains by me on the street everyone else has moved away perhaps my display has convinced
[02:54:00] them I've gone mad but where is still here the journalist our platoons unofficial intel officer
[02:54:07] we stare intently at each other fuck it I say fuck it agrees where that settles it I'm going back in
[02:54:23] it seemed very rational at the time again I really thought there were two bad guys in that house
[02:54:28] I know I'm good for two I figured even though they're talking I had to have hit them with something
[02:54:38] ricochet a piece of concrete maybe they went through their ammo but the clock is ticking and
[02:54:47] my biggest fear the reason why the so the Bradley the streets are very narrow and there's high walls
[02:54:52] the Bradley can only traverse at a certain elevation so it was only getting the upper stories
[02:54:56] and the gate was only so wide right the my fear was just give them something to think about so
[02:55:04] they don't run out because the last thing I wanted to do this was we're looking for 10 to 12 bad guys
[02:55:09] which everyone's looking for 10 to 12 bad guys and and it was in a structure of homes that was
[02:55:15] blocked off by four tanks so we had thermals they couldn't leave this block they're in here somewhere
[02:55:21] and this is a couple more houses to go this is all of them we think we hope it's all of them I don't
[02:55:29] want them getting back in the houses that we already cleared and now we're playing you know whack
[02:55:33] them all again and we're going to get someone killed or hurt hurt and but but again talking
[02:55:40] someone I heard the thought someone said we're going to die and so in the video I'm yelling
[02:55:46] we're not going to die and all the guys today will tell me no one said that that was in my head
[02:55:51] that I'm just I'm respite but they thought they were like dude you were having a full blown
[02:55:56] conversation and there was no one you were talking to you're answering questions you're you're taking
[02:56:02] food orders like you've lost your freaking mind and and uh I think we're sense that I think I think
[02:56:09] Michael we're sense that I was coming unglued and so he decides to egg you off so he's basically
[02:56:17] like this guy I think we've got we've got some hope here let's he's like what are you thinking
[02:56:22] without saying it he's like what are you thinking I'm thinking I want to do this and I was I was
[02:56:27] ready someone gave me an m16 a4 with a 203 I had one grenade I had 140 millimeter and I made the
[02:56:37] mistake of giving magazines away because I saw the enemy was wearing our uniform because that
[02:56:43] flusher brigade had all of our uniforms but I saw a guy running around with a with a marines rifle
[02:56:50] and this guy had the bandoliers the IBA and I just thought someone died and they got all of his ammo
[02:56:56] and there's no way I'm going to go in here and get waxed and then give because I was you know we
[02:57:01] were carrying I don't know how many magazines their combat load is not so so you know I don't want the
[02:57:07] guy to have everything so I carried five magazines one of them was empty which was my mistake so I
[02:57:15] had four full magazines and I probably should have taken much more than that you know no that that
[02:57:21] was a huge mistake but I was thinking I don't want these guys to have too much but then uh so so
[02:57:27] the the plan is I need as many saw gunners as I can now doctrine is one thing you've got your you
[02:57:35] know in a stack our military infantry seven dash eight you know non-special forces doctrine
[02:57:42] is you got a point man rifle and then you go with your grenadier and then you got your automatic
[02:57:48] weapon and then you got a leader team leader squad leader whatever it is what we learned very quickly
[02:57:53] in Fallujah is I need machine guns automatic fire I don't give a damn what it is shotguns and machine
[02:58:00] guns so we incredible for our battalion and our brigade and our division to just find brand new
[02:58:07] saws most of these saws were older than our saw gunners one of the time we deployed we got everything
[02:58:13] was new and they got the combat saw the smaller rifle the class will bust off this was this is
[02:58:20] good stuff so we all carried saws as many saws I can get so we had I said I wanted four guys around
[02:58:28] the building and I was going to run in there like a lunatic and try to push him out of the house
[02:58:35] and then our saw gunners would shoot him up that was that was the that was what we drew on on the
[02:58:41] dirt right Lawson is a buddy of mine Lawson died in 2013 great kid great guy he was our weapon squad
[02:58:48] leader he had an m14 only for Fallujah no night optics on it so when the m14 goes away the only
[02:58:55] thing he's got is a Beretta and I don't know if you know this but next to like gold a nine millimeter
[02:59:03] magazine was the hardest thing to find you would do anything to find an extra nine millimeter
[02:59:09] magazine they were just you could not every pog you know sitting around weather traffic they all
[02:59:14] had the nine millimeter magazines we couldn't find them so we only had two magazines of nine mill
[02:59:21] and he had his nine millimeter and that was it and night vision with no optics obviously it's a hand
[02:59:27] gun so we set up our guys as soon as I walk into the house the third time right so we were in the
[02:59:33] house leave the house the Bradley fights that's like the second fight and then I get in the house
[02:59:39] the second time the real fighting everything is different that Bradley fight a vehicle rearranged
[02:59:46] everything in that place and the first thing I noticed is that whatever plumbing system they had
[02:59:51] is all over the ground and it smells like a menstruating anchovy right it is horrific
[02:59:59] it is horrific I mean just the foulest nastiest dirtiest water in the world it's slick uh
[03:00:09] in and I there's fires everywhere so the areas that aren't wet have fires going on
[03:00:17] and I'm seeing these I thought they were at the at the time the the only light I had was night vision
[03:00:24] and the blinking of the of the shots that were fired the tracers and now I'm seeing that what I
[03:00:29] thought were bricks are just blocks of that plastic PE4 the shitty C4 though so and there's one like
[03:00:38] mushed on the ground and I'm like this entire freaking floor is wired and I think I gave the
[03:00:45] instruction because they're not very well they don't know they know as much about explosives as I do
[03:00:50] do and there's like these really long you know popsicle stick size blasting caps and they're
[03:01:00] like out there's some of them are hanging like speakers like just really poorly done not and
[03:01:07] the Brad just rattled everything so you got water and then there's broken mirrors everywhere
[03:01:13] and you could like look up in the corner and you could see a broken mirror through the fire in the
[03:01:17] night vision and you could see the corn so they saw us coming when we walked in but that worked
[03:01:23] two ways because I can see them at the 7-eleven that they built with their little mirrors everywhere
[03:01:29] and and then I I could hear one of the guys like doing his prayer like he was saying the same thing
[03:01:36] over and over again and that's when he started to he put he was screwing a fuse on a rocket
[03:01:45] it and his buddy under the stairwell was holding the rocket and he was basically fixing the rocket
[03:01:54] to fire the RPG he's got an open door behind him and I was like okay game's over Lawson's inside
[03:02:02] the guys are outside he fires that RPG at the you know I'm not MacGyver what you shoot a rocket at
[03:02:10] a bunch of flash explosives gonna blow up right I don't know what the hell's going on I mean
[03:02:14] was it raised in Mogadishu you know so I don't know how explosives and all that work
[03:02:19] he's got that rocket he's gonna shoot it we're all done so the plan was now and everywhere I'm
[03:02:27] walking with the water it's sending a wake of little ripples everywhere so they know there's
[03:02:33] someone's in here so I don't have any choices I just decide it's we're doing it so Lawson doesn't
[03:02:41] even know like what's the plan what's you know what do we we're whispering like we're just doing it
[03:02:46] he's just in there with his nine mill with his nine mill he's following your right and Michael
[03:02:51] where with a camera Michael where with the camera trying to get light what's your night what are you
[03:02:55] seeing through your night vision because they got you got fires in there that screws it up you
[03:02:59] could no ambient light or is that ambient light working for you like what are you seeing through
[03:03:03] your night vision so I wasn't an airborne guy but I was told that the airborne infantry changed the
[03:03:09] way the night vision works so when you make a sudden jerk of your head the night vision shuts off
[03:03:15] and whether it was just running or just the motion of whatever I was doing my ps14s were
[03:03:25] cutting off and turning back on and it was the worst time because the only reason why I got that
[03:03:30] rifle it's got a pq2 alpha which is an infrared flashlight and an infrared laser now you're
[03:03:37] anti-oakly with that thing I don't have to aim it I mean I'm popping dudes from the hip with a
[03:03:42] pq2 alpha I've got a line right to you I could you know yeah so but without the ps14 it's crap
[03:03:50] and these things are just on and off they're just going in it never happened before I had great night
[03:03:55] I was like proud of the way I took care of my night the guys would break their night vision be like
[03:03:59] you dear responsible horrible human being you know what a marine would do to have that you get a seven
[03:04:06] bravo for the rest of your life you don't deserve the ps14 that was such a cool thing to have the
[03:04:12] ps14s and the squalid and we took great care of them and I never had an issue and all of a sudden
[03:04:19] like you need it you need to make that flight and it's delayed and you're screwed and my night vision
[03:04:26] start coming on and off and so I just said all right I turned it off I turned it right back on
[03:04:31] and I'm like I just need just to get through that door again I'm thinking there's two guys in this
[03:04:37] house the only two people I've seen are under that stairwell and that's it and nobody's communicating
[03:04:44] there's we don't know what the other platoon is doing they're on the other side of the street they
[03:04:49] don't know where I am the Brad leave the a lot of confusion but I walked through that door and I saw
[03:04:56] his eyes and I was like oh yeah like you had no idea of all the thing you thought back door
[03:05:04] see I thought they were thinking back door too right I put the guys they were super loud they're
[03:05:09] getting around the house now we're gonna come through the back door and then we came to the front
[03:05:13] door again and I see this guy's teeth and they're beautiful teeth like veneer teeth like my dad's
[03:05:20] a dentist I know good teeth and this guy smiles and I just I just start shooting and uh and then
[03:05:27] my night vision dies again but I got quality aimed shots with a PQ2 alpha and I figured I got them both
[03:05:36] and one guy ran and the other one got trapped between the jersey barrier and the stairwell he
[03:05:43] he couldn't move out of that area so he was pretty much done um and but the other guy ran to the
[03:05:50] kitchen in front and it was like okay one guy that's it one guy left and he's wounded you know
[03:05:59] I hit him a couple times um and then as I'm doing that I'm walking backwards away from the stairwell
[03:06:06] and I'm like this is a room and I'm just standing in the doorway of a room and then as soon as I'm
[03:06:12] thinking I haven't cleared this room yet the guy from the kitchen starts shooting back and then
[03:06:18] Lawson with his nine mil is just you know gangster from the side just popping this guy and this guy
[03:06:27] starts shooting at Lawson uh from the kitchen and as he's doing that Lawson just kind of pops back
[03:06:33] into the water and whether he had hit through the wall or got I don't know I don't know it's dark I
[03:06:39] don't know what's happening he's not saying anything was just smart right you know what he's a tough guy
[03:06:45] he's been hurt before and he's never cried or screamed or anything so he just kind of went back
[03:06:50] and he just his whole arm just drops and he's got his hand on his shoulder and he's reaching for his
[03:06:57] neck and he's like is this blood or water and I'm like oh no like that's not the choice I can't see
[03:07:05] he's like it feels it's slick I'm like but the water slick you know the one he's he's I'm he's
[03:07:11] he's doing this like with his hand he's no he can't move his fingers so he's like he just points to
[03:07:17] his weapon and with one finger says I have one mag left doesn't he just won and I'm like okay and so
[03:07:25] I switch out mags and I back into this room and it's a master bedroom and I have there's like
[03:07:32] like a bed a wardrobe and and I I gotta clear it right and as I'm doing that these guys come running
[03:07:44] through the door and so now we're exchanging fire but I'm noticing that there are tracers going
[03:07:51] horizontally in the room and I'm thinking it is my zero off like am I am I just you know like
[03:07:58] because I'm shooting from the hip and the ps 14s are coming on off and I'm like am I shooting to the
[03:08:04] side you know it's just peek a two did it get damaged did it get jostled what's happening
[03:08:10] where these rounds are going horizontal and my platoon sergeant screaming in my radio and with
[03:08:16] that noise from my ear everyone and I hear a cavalcade of footsteps upstairs next room over
[03:08:26] and I'm like this radio is going to be the death of me so I just take I told him I said
[03:08:32] two efforts down one rpg I'm really stressed out right now I'm really stressed out right now
[03:08:41] and I just threw the radio in the water and uh and that that's when I realized that
[03:08:46] that I could start to cheat a little bit and use the gap of my night vision solid for a little bit
[03:08:56] and I used to have that peeky too and I could use the gap between the frame of the of the door in
[03:09:00] the concrete metal frame and there's like a hole and that that dude was just like like trying to
[03:09:07] creep up on the door and I'm like I got you you know and so I just put the rounds through that gap
[03:09:14] and I couldn't have done it without a laser obviously and uh he buckled and but the weirdest
[03:09:21] thing was that guys would fall and I'd look over and they weren't there and so I'm like
[03:09:27] is this Hollywood's obviously full of crap but I mean is this the same guy or is this a different
[03:09:34] guy and is he running up down the stairs what's going on and just as that happens um
[03:09:41] um another guy comes tearing down the stairs and you could I could hear his pants um and as he hits
[03:09:48] the water again that ripple gave him away in the water and he just started firing and I popped him
[03:09:56] and then the guy came out of the kitchen the original guy that was when he came out of the
[03:10:00] kitchen and then all of a sudden I'm just kind of relaxed and everything's cool and uh I hear
[03:10:08] some guys screaming from the stairwell uh and he's it's like British a British accent and he's just
[03:10:15] like talking and uh I don't know if it's Lawson I don't know if it's Michael what Michael what
[03:10:22] is Australian is he talking to me but this guy's like talking about like your your mommy won't find
[03:10:28] your dog tags and I'm like is me what the you know what are you trying to intimidate me like so I'm
[03:10:36] speaking broken Arabic first infantry division manual stop or I'll shoot do not resist first
[03:10:43] American infantry all that crap and then I hear like dog or something to help whatever and as I'm
[03:10:54] going through all that another target appears in the door and I'm shooting that target and I see a
[03:11:01] long stream of of rifle fire that is from my left out of a wardrobe straight into the wall
[03:11:11] and I'm like I did not I didn't you shoot I that was not me you know what I mean and I'm like oh my
[03:11:16] god there's a dude in this room and as soon as I even process that the door has just come flying
[03:11:25] open and he runs out and he's got a snub nose ak under his armpit so he's running this way and the
[03:11:34] rifle's pointed behind him and he's just squeezing it like behind him oh okay right so he's planning
[03:11:39] to try and get out of the room I think he's just trying to get up but he's it's dark and he can't
[03:11:43] see anything and the wardrobe falls on its doors which again there's a lot of miracles
[03:11:49] but that is probably the most miraculous thing is that an entire wardrobe like a foot locker
[03:11:55] you know like a wall locker that'll landed on its doors because if that thing would have fallen
[03:12:01] flat he shot right into that wall locker into that wardrobe and had that thing been flat that
[03:12:10] would have gone right into me and the side of the wall as well and it just absorbed through the the
[03:12:16] wall I took I thought I got hit the elbow and I just instantly it's it's wet but I'm wet too so
[03:12:27] it's like what's going on but I remember grabbing my arm and I'm doing this inventory of like you
[03:12:33] did it you got shot and it's not that bad right it's not that bad it hurts you can't see it but you
[03:12:41] are now a bullet shot you've been a victim of a bullet wound and all these guys that acted tough
[03:12:49] you now know what they went through you're just as tough as they are you're not gonna you're not
[03:12:55] gonna scream menek you're not gonna leave you're gonna breathe you got shot in the arm and you're
[03:13:00] good to go you're lucky stay in the fight everything's good and then I'm like this really hurts like
[03:13:06] it doesn't go I mean like it really hurt and I'm like oh okay but I'm like I'm psyching myself up
[03:13:13] right dude is at the court he's leaning against the the metal the doors weren't like real doors
[03:13:20] they're like metallic tin doors and he's leaning against it and I hit him now again I thought I
[03:13:27] hit him six or seven times the video it's like three shots but again what I'm thinking what
[03:13:33] actually happened I thought I hit him repeatedly but I got him in the lower back and it was the
[03:13:39] first time I heard someone like actually scream like really loud and he moves his way out the door
[03:13:46] but I hear him up the stairs and this is the time where I get to do my little field you know medic
[03:13:52] I'm gonna treat my own arm wound put a tourniquet on you know I'm like it's below it's right here
[03:13:59] in the little joint area my elbow and I'm like oh my god I feel I feel the bullet like the bullet
[03:14:06] is actually in my arm and this is crazy because there's no Kevlar and it would make no sense
[03:14:12] that a bullet would lodge and just kind of stay there so I'm like oh I feel dizzy but as the smell
[03:14:18] isn't my nerves I can't pass out now and I just kind of flick it out and I feel it and it's a
[03:14:24] it's like a piece of wood it's a splinter and I'm like dude you went from almost being shot by a bullet
[03:14:32] to a splinter and you were gonna take yourself out of this fight you know I didn't really call a
[03:14:37] medivac for a splinter I went from thinking I'm just like every other tough guy so I get shot to be
[03:14:42] in like you don't even can't take a splinter like you were gonna punch out for a splinter man
[03:14:47] you know it means like my head is going from like super confident to but when he left and he
[03:14:56] turned and I saw his face I'm like he's scared and I like the fact that I hit him repeatedly
[03:15:04] he's wounded and he's scared and he wants to run away from me so I figured okay
[03:15:10] Lawson go get I'm yelling to Lawson I need saws and shotguns and fits and first squad get everyone
[03:15:20] to get the whole platoon in here and he's like I'm not leaving and I'm like no you gotta leave
[03:15:26] because we need to get everyone in here right so I don't want to be on that floor because I'm
[03:15:32] thinking Bradley fire or the guys just coming to start spraying I have nowhere to get cover
[03:15:37] and the best place I want to be is at least on the second floor to tell them hey you know
[03:15:42] smoke grenade flare I'm here right but I know that guy's there and I look up the stairs and
[03:15:48] I could see his wet feet but then there's blood like a lot of blood on the stairs and I make my
[03:15:55] way up in between my wet shoes my wet boots and the blood I take a step on the puddle of blood
[03:16:03] and both feet just go completely out like like I lost my footing completely and when I lost my
[03:16:12] footing at that moment a round just went off from the second level of the stairs and it was right
[03:16:20] and our bullets when they hit like brick or concrete ricochet that 762 just it just went
[03:16:30] right through it but I could see it and I was like that's where my head was right and so I went from
[03:16:38] I got this guy to I just slipped and if I didn't stand up I would have been done
[03:16:44] and then when I got to the second level my ps 14's went I went to when I went to flick them on
[03:16:51] they went to IR you know that light that looked like yeah that shines and I saw his face and he
[03:16:58] was just all kinds of stressed I imagine he was very stressed and I was like this guy's mine
[03:17:05] and one more that's it so I'm doing my head I'm like one two three or is that one two three four
[03:17:12] like I I'm just trying to do an inventory of how many are there still people live downstairs
[03:17:18] did I just leave Lawson and where would alive guys or is this just two guys and I'm just losing
[03:17:24] it you know if Lawson went to get the rest of the squad yet I can't hear anything my hearing's gone
[03:17:30] and not only that I can't the building is so big and thick that with the water if it was empty and
[03:17:39] dry maybe you could hear echoes of whatever but the only thing you could really hear was what was
[03:17:46] coming at you when something went from hits the water the water was the giveaway that there was
[03:17:54] someone coming because you could hear the splash and you could see the signature of it but upstairs
[03:18:00] was dry it was super dry up there and now I'm I'm back to I got my rifle and I charged a magazine
[03:18:12] and I think this was the last what felt it felt like 20 that it shot maybe just one of those I
[03:18:18] recharged and didn't have full 30 but I took out my grenade and and this is where I was going to
[03:18:24] practice my cooking off I was so proud of how I cooked the grenades off I was cooking grenades
[03:18:29] off at the 12th grade level you know I I was really good at it at that point and that sizzle
[03:18:35] you know so many guys would tape their spoons and then they just throw the grenade with this tape
[03:18:42] off but the spoon would stick to the casing right you pull your pin and you threw it and it never
[03:18:48] went off because the spoon stuck to the it'd been taped for so long so I was I guess not
[03:18:55] happening to me I'm and I and I brought to my ear you got to be careful because you know defense
[03:19:01] contractors five seconds two seconds but I couldn't hear the sizzle my ears were so shot that I was
[03:19:09] like one one two and I just was like oh no you know like that's how this story ends you've been
[03:19:20] blowing my own head off with a grenade in my ear like he's taking a call like Mossad blew me up for
[03:19:25] taking a call and I as I turned to look at him I the room was an L shape right so I had like a
[03:19:35] like a perpendicular I threw the grenade I hit him with a grenade but it went into a big pile
[03:19:40] of these foam mattresses and I heard it kaboom and I heard him you know hurt and it got bit by
[03:19:51] something it shrapnel hit him somewhere but when I came into the room I instantly tripped over
[03:19:57] my my shin scraped off the top of just a mess of propane tanks I mean the entire room was full
[03:20:07] of propane tanks I fired one around and I just smelled this like really oily thick smoke that was
[03:20:15] like plastic foam burning and natural gas and not and I just like I can't I can't shoot again
[03:20:23] because I'm going to blow the tanks up or do whatever so I just kind of used my rifle to
[03:20:29] find him in the room of smoke and wave the smoke around and just try to find where he is and whack
[03:20:36] him as hard as I could and that's where you know we just started wailing on each other in the dark
[03:20:43] and the smoke just kind of where is he where is he at and I didn't want to bend the barrel the
[03:20:49] the M4 is a rifle that you know I butt-stroke to people with that plastic butt and it's it doesn't
[03:20:55] really do what you want it to do but the problem with the M4 is that if you wax someone hard enough
[03:21:00] you're going to bend your barrel right so I mean that you're taking your rifle out of the fight
[03:21:05] and I got Sanos's rifle but it's heavier you know the A4 had that stock that was you know
[03:21:12] and so that that's much better to go into the fight with than an M4 would be so I just tried to
[03:21:20] take advantage of that and I I really it was the first time I realized how how exhausted I was I was
[03:21:27] I was really spent you know and I was starting to feel like my stomach was tightening and
[03:21:33] breathing became harder and and I I was hoping that I could just get close to him and shoot him
[03:21:42] right like like be able to get a close shot into him but I also realized that when a person is
[03:21:50] fighting for their life they're not going to give you any of those openings and I could tell he was
[03:21:56] older the foam would burn and then die and then a flame would pop and then it would die and then a
[03:22:06] flame would pop again and he had a gray beard and he was wearing a bandolier like you know around his
[03:22:16] you know around his waist and so yeah it was like every time I thought I had an advantage he had a
[03:22:27] big gouge out of his his arm his forearm had a giant bite from shrapnel and so when he would do
[03:22:37] something to me I would just kind of put my hands in that that wound and that and he just
[03:22:43] complete you know that he that was so much pain that he would you could tell him his guard was down
[03:22:49] but this is why we need to teach self-defense and and jiu-jitsu or something because in the gear
[03:22:56] it's hard enough to move you know god forbid if I had elbow pads on I would I wouldn't have made it
[03:23:02] but the vest is so heavy and the way we load the vest is he makes it even more unbalanced
[03:23:08] I didn't have any moves I didn't have a choke I didn't have anything to do and my hands were wet
[03:23:17] usually hair so I I stuck my finger in his eye and I figured that that was gonna to do it and I
[03:23:29] I was so freaked out by the way an eyeball you know ruptures that it it just unnerved me the whole
[03:23:36] thing was just so it seemed like I was cheating you know what I mean like I was doing something that
[03:23:43] was not what we're supposed to do I never had an experience with with anything like that before
[03:23:52] I've never done anything like that in my life training no one's ever given us a power pointer
[03:23:59] class on that and and I had my helmet you know and and so I figured my helmet is probably but I my
[03:24:09] ps 14's around the helmet and the tie down at that point when I took my helmet off the we
[03:24:15] these no one ties the elites don't tie things down but we tie everything down because we're so
[03:24:21] irresponsible you never know when you lose something and and I had a I tied it down but
[03:24:26] when I took my helmet off my 14's fell and now you've got like this you know pendulum
[03:24:33] and so it's it's not you're not able to get what you want now the the part of the story that gets
[03:24:41] misinterpreted a lot is that I took a sappy plate and everyone said I took my sappy plate out
[03:24:47] I opened my vest and on an IBA at that time it was velcro one side had a plate the other side
[03:24:55] didn't and so as I was trying to hit him I wasn't getting enough force with my helmet I I took his
[03:25:02] head and I just kind of used the open vest to subdue him if you ask me that's when the fight
[03:25:10] really stopped that I would think that I that at that point it was I don't think he was we weren't
[03:25:18] equals at that point whatever you got the upper hand yeah the wounds that he was sustaining to
[03:25:23] his head between the helmet and the sappy plate were enough to either disorient him or or make him
[03:25:30] just not a problem at least in my own head I thought everything was great
[03:25:37] and he goes to the ground and when he goes to the ground I put my hand over his mouth and I'm
[03:25:45] literally all my force is got one hand the one arm is wounded and when I put my leg on it
[03:25:53] he's like his hips are coming up he's it's hurting him but then he's yelling and then I hear a guy
[03:26:02] above us yell back and that's when I completely went from I'm in control and I'm gonna be okay
[03:26:10] to complete you know a panic of I don't have the strength I don't have the strength to do this
[03:26:16] right and he's wounded I mean shoot me four times you know I don't know if I could do what he's doing
[03:26:23] but if there's another guy that I have not yet met and he's 100 healthy I'm in deep trouble I'm
[03:26:32] in trouble and so as we're we're I've lost complete positive control of my rifle at this point
[03:26:37] and I'm trying to find it with one foot and just kind of probe my foot out to find my strap I could
[03:26:47] drag it to me or do whatever and he bites my hand really aggressively right and it's it's like
[03:26:57] now I'm I'm firing on you know I thought I had him in a good grip where I could at least and I
[03:27:04] thought the fight was out of him and he just starts biting me and then as I move up my body
[03:27:11] the hand that I was not holding I just I just heard a loud crack of what turned out to be a Soviet 45
[03:27:22] I don't even know where he had it or where it came from but I just fired directly in the wrong
[03:27:28] he didn't thank God he didn't know where my head was but it was close enough to my head that it
[03:27:32] went from not being able to hear cloudy to like ringing not being able to hear you know which is
[03:27:39] it's like a tinnitus versus I just can't hear you know and that was that was really like it
[03:27:46] affected my equilibrium and affected my thought process things became dire I went from super
[03:27:53] confident to like this isn't going to work out and you and when I stood up looking for my rifle I
[03:28:00] felt that I had my Gerber in my cargo pocket not on my belt which would have been almost impossible
[03:28:06] with the adrenaline and the sweat and the water to pull that out it was so tight to my belt that it
[03:28:13] would have been you know but it was in my cargo pocket and and a lot of people think that's a
[03:28:19] multi-tool they say he killed you know the multi-tool came out it was a Rex Applegate
[03:28:25] you know a very quick release and I just figured I would I would just pop him I was just gonna
[03:28:36] let him know you know no but ask it and I was speaking broken Arabic it turns out he didn't
[03:28:44] even speak Arabic but I was just trying to tell him to shut up and so I could hear what was being
[03:28:51] said or how many were you know was it said our guys maybe it's it's my guys coming up and I just
[03:28:57] can't hear and so I just I was just letting him know I have a knife and and then it was he bit
[03:29:04] me again and when he bit me you know in my he bit you know my lower body and and that was
[03:29:13] unbelievable pain it was unbelievable pain and it was just a complete adrenaline spike and it became
[03:29:21] I'm gonna I'm just gonna jab him you know I'm gonna I'm gonna cut him and when I when I put it in
[03:29:27] it hits collarbone and it cut my side of my pinky down my hands kind of went off the blade and kind
[03:29:38] of went to the to the knife and it nothing happened it was too hard and it was not in the right region
[03:29:46] and then when I put my hand over his neck I kind of felt where or I could guide it and as soon as
[03:29:53] I put it in it was a cold night it was a rainy night I felt steam like warm hot steam and there was
[03:30:05] a noise that I couldn't I couldn't hear the noise but I could feel the noise it's a it's like you
[03:30:13] there was a the spurt was this is and everything just auto rebooted he was just like it was over
[03:30:26] it was like there was no you know there was no uh response to it you know and uh the only thing I
[03:30:35] took enough science to know that I could speed it up and so I just kind of was doing like a little
[03:30:44] bit of um like a CPR almost I just to just get just to end it you know just to get all of it out
[03:30:54] and so I just started putting you know like doing CPR uh to to end it and and that's that was it and
[03:31:04] and after all that I I it was ridiculous and it wasn't I wanted a cigarette you know and uh I went
[03:31:16] outside and and again my helmet's gone my vest is open my rifle is somewhere on the ground I have
[03:31:24] a magazine maybe I don't know eight rounds left uh 10 rounds much less than 30 and I know there's a
[03:31:35] guy above me but it's a porch and there's a roof on top of it and so I just kind of cupped my hands
[03:31:45] but I wanted the cigarette to be like my light right because I have no night vision and I figure
[03:31:51] and I figure if I get that cherry going I could at least signal someone if they're coming in because
[03:31:56] I haven't you know I figured I could at least see something get some nicotine I mean I wanted
[03:32:03] nicotine but I also wanted to see like what was going on signal do whatever and as I'm dragging
[03:32:09] that outside open air I just hear like uh like someone like took off like a scuttle of feet and
[03:32:21] like the the most grotesque Joe Thysman snap um I've ever witnessed I played sports I've seen
[03:32:29] guys you know break legs and compound fractures Achilles injuries I've never that was a bad one
[03:32:35] and whatever he landed on completely immobilized him when he landed on the ground and um he was
[03:32:44] was in severe distress and and emotional about how much he was hurting and the magazine swiveled out
[03:32:54] of his uh you know uh no buttstock on the AK um it was a short AK with no buttstock and the magazine
[03:33:03] was out and when I threw it back in and and re recharged it it just was way it burst it was on
[03:33:12] automatic and it just burst and very little accuracy I don't think I hit him with the AK
[03:33:20] and then when I ran into the the building uh he fell like back into a water tank in the corner
[03:33:27] and he couldn't move his like he was one leg was the only thing that was causing you know
[03:33:34] his ability to move but the rifle I ran into the rifle and my rifle and so I picked it up and I just
[03:33:43] shot um until it went empty and I don't I hit him I could see that you know I hit him and I hit his
[03:33:53] wounded leg and I hit him in the back uh near the kidney and all I know is I didn't know if there was
[03:34:00] a landing he a canopy there was a canopy underneath that part of the building but I just heard the
[03:34:06] saws open up on him so when I looked over finally um I could see that he was you know head first in
[03:34:15] the in the palm area and the two machine gunners had had done their thing and then the guys come
[03:34:22] flying in and Lawson ends up getting shot by a shotgun Lawson uh total accident but Lawson
[03:34:32] basically was on the second story and he was like terminators our guys are called terminators terminators
[03:34:38] coming in and he just kind of turned the corner and if someone hit him in the sappy plate but that
[03:34:43] could have been horrific and so the next they're like bomb is coming in bombs coming in and I just
[03:34:53] my voice was hoarse I was like totally like you know shook and uh we ran out of the house and um
[03:35:02] fast mover dropped a bomb and it went right through the you hear it like like you'd hear it like it
[03:35:07] didn't go off and then uh they brought so that was a 250 they brought in a 500 that thing bounced
[03:35:17] and I don't know if it was our laser if it was the few I don't know what happened two bombs were
[03:35:23] duds the final one was a 2000 pound bomb and we were all like outside of the house that blast
[03:35:32] was worse than anything that happened inside the house I mean it just voided all of our
[03:35:39] I mean just like we just like uncontrollable vomiting like so you were just outside the
[03:35:44] house when the 2000 the Bradley's so the Bradley's all pulled up on a line and the guys got inside
[03:35:49] the Bradley's and and zipped up and Fitz had grabbed me as I was making sure all the guys
[03:35:56] were in the brass he just grabbed me threw me a hole and honestly we got the best end of it
[03:36:02] because the guys that were in the brads got just completely concussed from that boxed in area
[03:36:08] and all that munition I mean danger close I'd say it was I don't know 200 meters from where the bomb
[03:36:16] went off and the all the periscopes on the side of the brads were all shattered um and the guys were
[03:36:24] all like woozy and vomit it was really bad and they got shook really really good we were outside
[03:36:30] and I think we got the better end of it I think I think because we were low and in a hole we didn't
[03:36:36] get nearly as messed up as all of it but we go back in pull the bodies out um you know start doing
[03:36:49] our inventory and the next day I want dies our executive officer and then JC Madison died and
[03:36:59] then Sims died and it just kind of was like crazy day but there's like 12 other crazy days to go
[03:37:06] and we just kind of did our thing and and then 15 years later I get a call that the DOD is doing
[03:37:12] an investigation and people I haven't talked to in 15 years are calling me telling me that they're
[03:37:17] looking into every aspect of my military career and I'm thinking like a lot of guys have happened
[03:37:23] and someone gets a little jealous someone gets upset and they said something happened the way
[03:37:31] I had a reporter investigating and the military calling I lawyered up I got a lawyer
[03:37:39] and I was like you know I'm not going to jail like what's going on and then Trump called
[03:37:44] hold on before we get to that before we get to that so the this whole story that you just told
[03:37:53] about beating in this house um this is November 10th 2004 this is your your 29th birthday 29th
[03:38:00] birthday yeah this is two days into the battle yes because there's a couple days and there's a
[03:38:04] little bit of a low as it kicks off you know right it's hard for you guys to get through the breach
[03:38:09] you guys get in there it and it takes a couple days I mean there's action out of the gate but
[03:38:15] but this is definitely a highlight for what you guys were doing yeah um like you said
[03:38:23] Lieutenant E1 November 12th he's standing in a brad he's actually waving goodbye to where
[03:38:32] who's going to like fill his report or whatever he's going to do and he gets hit with uh he gets
[03:38:40] hit with an rpg um rpg doesn't detonate so it's like awful um you you got in in the book remember
[03:38:51] the ramrods you've got this this quote do they take you know his brother had died and you explain
[03:38:56] this in the book and again there's so many there's so many things in this book but you know his
[03:39:00] brother had died in 1989 and so uh Ed E1 they his parents want him buried you know in the cemetery
[03:39:10] in their small town in uh Nebraska I believe and there's a inscription on his grave about about
[03:39:18] Lieutenant Ed E1 it says Ed lived every moment he stood in the rain heard the thunder danced to the
[03:39:25] lightning and believed in rainbows that's the 12th the next day um the the individual that we've
[03:39:38] talked a bunch about captain sims who's your who's your company commander um a guy and it's it's you
[03:39:45] know I don't think I covered this but as you guys are going in you know this guy realizes what kind
[03:39:52] of a fight you're about to go into and it's not going to be a hearts and mind fight and you guys
[03:39:57] all really come together as and he knows you're going to be relying on his door kickers um and
[03:40:07] so the next day after uh Lieutenant E1 dies captain sims he's um kind of catching up with
[03:40:15] you guys on the battlefield you guys are tired and he's going to go basically do a strong point
[03:40:21] of building kind of set up a little command post or something and you know you're like hey boss let
[03:40:27] me let me go clear that thing for you let me get my squad in there let me clear that thing and he's
[03:40:30] like no you guys get some rest stand down he says air out your feet get some chow we'll take care of
[03:40:35] it and um it was a building that had been cleared but you know if they'd been left and cleared and
[03:40:42] left and when these guys go in it um they get into gunfight captain sims is killed
[03:40:55] and like you said you know this is and this is something sometimes people forget is that when
[03:40:59] someone gets killed in combat combat continues and you still have a mission you still have enemy
[03:41:05] and you still keep going and that's what that's what happens you guys keep going uh for a total
[03:41:14] of 10 days it's november 17th you guys finally come out of the field um and you got some great
[03:41:25] you got some great perspective in there you know as you're coming out of the field and
[03:41:30] and what that's like you guys are now uh seen way more than anybody else has seen in certain the
[03:41:37] the the remps in the rear you know they're trying to tell you to get your uniform squared away and
[03:41:41] this stuff and uh always that that that contrast between the guys that are on the front lines the
[03:41:46] guys that aren't the time magazine article comes out so michael where like you said works for time
[03:41:54] so you guys are out of the field on november 17th november 22nd this article comes out
[03:42:01] that he's written it's called uh into the hot zone and it's it's it's telling your story uh
[03:42:08] you're it's telling your company's story and of course i mean you know the the fallujah event
[03:42:17] was in every it was in the entire news for you know three week period and so now everybody
[03:42:25] is reading this article about you about your guys um and all that being said deployments not over yet
[03:42:33] you guys still have another three months of deployment left
[03:42:39] what are you guys doing when you get out of fallujah what's that recovery like
[03:42:44] and and now what's your mission towards the end of deployment so you know we don't really know
[03:42:49] about the magazine the article um but everyone in our sector knows about fallujah and they know
[03:42:57] that when we were gone we were replaced by units that didn't have the same logo on their arms the
[03:43:03] insignia and what that meant the the red one and uh that we were in fallujah and that bought us a
[03:43:10] tremendous amount of street credit with the with the bad guys you know it's um we were super cocky
[03:43:18] we were super confident uh and we weren't you know the mistakes that we made the zigen and zagan
[03:43:25] and the old days was long gone the chances we were taking you know they always talk about how
[03:43:31] when you know john the john bas alone story of you know you get a guy that does crazy things
[03:43:37] at guata canal and then he wants to go back to iwo and the unit that he led i mean they got a
[03:43:46] john bas alone um is a legend and an icon he's selling war bonds he's dating hollywood starlets
[03:43:53] i mean this was a national hero and everyone hung on everything he said he had so much street credit
[03:43:59] he didn't last what 15 minutes on iwo and and so there are things that the reason why they take you
[03:44:07] out when things like fallujah ramadi big set plays where units do crazy things is because you you
[03:44:14] don't have a sense of of your mortality and you do take chances that you think well has it happened
[03:44:21] yet you know i'll roll it until you know we fold and our unit was doing that i mean we were just
[03:44:31] like in the old days if you took fire the enemy stopped you know you'd give chase you do your
[03:44:37] job but at the end of the day we fired they stopped they ran away who cares after fallujah we we were
[03:44:46] going to kill you like we were going to take you out and it didn't matter how long it went down it
[03:44:50] didn't matter you know we had guys going through tunnels and you know it's very difficult to clear
[03:44:57] an attic you know that's one of the most dangerous things you can do because you're literally just
[03:45:01] popping up in the middle of a floor and anything can hit you and those are always you know guys
[03:45:07] were just doing things they'd never done before because they survived what was you know an epic
[03:45:15] urban fight and i noticed it and i noticed that election day was the big thing the battle
[03:45:21] fallujah was because january 2005 was going to be the first free election and all of the craziness
[03:45:27] that were going that was going to happen on election day and so our mission came to just we had a
[03:45:34] pretty good handle on diala province before fallujah when we left there was that period where they
[03:45:40] regressed a little bit just because the unit you know you're brand new you don't know the area very
[03:45:44] well great soldiers they just didn't know our area and so they were only there for a month and a half
[03:45:51] and we started to see that they were taking liberties we took those liberties back we counterpunched we
[03:45:56] did great things but it also became a way like it was real now like the guys were gone they weren't
[03:46:03] etsing they weren't going to a different duty station they were no longer there in the memorial
[03:46:09] services and the you know and you just take more loss towards the end of a deployment you think
[03:46:16] why are we taking loss at the end we're so close to just going home like is this in what's the point
[03:46:22] what are we doing and so that became more of a struggle of keeping our poise and our focus
[03:46:31] but also the discipline was the hardest for leaders at the end that's when all the crazy
[03:46:39] happens like in the last 30 days of a deployment is when nothing can be rationalized no loss no
[03:46:46] injury no death nothing makes any sense because you're that close to the finish line and it takes
[03:46:52] a lot to just kind of you know maybe i'm going a little bit too crazy you know what you don't want
[03:46:58] is you don't want you know that that guy who's getting out of the army he's got a month left in
[03:47:03] a combat zone and this is Jerry Rice's last football game and he wants one more touchdown before he
[03:47:09] hangs it up i don't want a guy who wants one more fight you know before he hangs it up you know so
[03:47:15] you you want to be reasonable but at the same time professional and disciplined but that was that
[03:47:22] was tough because you know there's and then these units are coming in to replace you and they've
[03:47:27] done nothing but red you become our unit became like army rock stars you know they they were in
[03:47:36] magazines and their army times and the and so guys are taking photos with these new guys and sign
[03:47:43] in furniture and this is the coffee maker from the gunner of the you know like they it was a weird
[03:47:50] feeling to hear your unit and these names of guys that you work with every day and they're
[03:47:56] enrolling stone magazine they're in they're on cnn they're talking about falconry hey turn on
[03:48:02] could you tape me fox news they're doing a special on on sarma falconry like what like
[03:48:08] is your son major like it was the it was a very surreal experience to go from the backwater
[03:48:17] and a unit that really peaked in vietnam to the first division back where it's cool again
[03:48:25] and all these guys who just did their jobs are now you know doing interviews you know you've got
[03:48:32] reporters that are sneaking out of the fob to interview the boys from falooja a month later and
[03:48:39] it's just like it was very surreal um you know because it's just a lot of attention and it's
[03:48:46] not necessarily people process it differently you know and you guys end up going home in february
[03:48:53] 2005 yeah and at what point are you deciding that you're going to get out of the army
[03:49:00] you know my whole thing was so i didn't know anything about you know the time magazine everything
[03:49:07] you hear about you know you're in a vacuum but the there was a big award ceremony going out for
[03:49:14] the division and a welcome home and again we're a german unit and it was a lot of silver stars and
[03:49:21] bronze stars and a lot of these guys that did incredible things you know it was hard to get
[03:49:27] a private a specialist in e5 the award that they deserve a lot of guys that really never squeezed
[03:49:33] around were getting awards that probably you know our service awards not valer awards you you have
[03:49:40] that in every unit but it was apparent that they were going to take this falooja fight and essentially
[03:49:49] make this award a distinguished service cross and that's the way it was built we did the unit the
[03:49:59] brigade commander paul ray smith had just received the medal of honor the first recipient since vietnam
[03:50:06] posthumously for what happened in 2003 at the airport in bagdad and so this was going to be
[03:50:14] the second a distinguished service cross which would have been the first distinguished service
[03:50:18] cross since vietnam so we got the medal of honor and the distinguished service cross and this is
[03:50:23] what you're hearing about your award yeah so so i'm getting the dsc that's that's the way the the
[03:50:29] ceremony is going to be all the guys get their silver stars and bronze stars and we're going to
[03:50:32] hold the dsc secretary of the army's coming to germany hold division it's a dsc award i did a
[03:50:38] commercial for armed forces network talking about getting the dsc and the dsc is in the back i mean
[03:50:45] that it was happening and as that's going all going down they're basically saying no one knows
[03:50:53] anything more than the dsc and it's not an award that you you know you you don't know how to write
[03:50:59] it and the witnesses and so the division did the dsc with battalion and witnesses and whatnot and
[03:51:07] secretary of the army shows up day of the award uh would do their rehearsals we're getting ready for
[03:51:13] the live the band the division commander and the secretary of the army is like belvey's not getting
[03:51:21] the dsc and so i'm like all right you know like what that kind of sucks i mean we did the commercials
[03:51:30] i'm in my uniform here like what's going on and they're like they're upgrading it and i didn't
[03:51:37] you know i was like they're upgrading the dsc i mean it doesn't make any sense like what is
[03:51:43] going on and it went from being upgraded to just you know army times usa today all these media people
[03:51:54] telling the world that i'm going to i'm nominated for the medal of honor which is not something the
[03:51:59] army puts out no one puts that out you can't say you're nominated for anything it's not you know
[03:52:05] you're either approved or you either get it or you don't there's no like you didn't get the medal of
[03:52:09] honor give them the dsc it's the medal of honor nothing right you can take a silver star and upgrade
[03:52:16] it you can take a dsc and upgrade it but you don't get like a fallback award you know it doesn't work
[03:52:22] in reverse so i go home i i leave uh there was a lot that happened on that deployment and our unit
[03:52:31] was disbanded uh so half of the guys went to another unit and deployed in in eight months the rest of
[03:52:39] the guys went to stomp lost guys went home everyone went home and i just was like i'm going to be a
[03:52:45] civilian and uh i wanted to do some embedding i wanted to do you know some other stuff work some
[03:52:51] vets groups and whatnot and then i get a package in the mail and it's the silver star and it isn't
[03:52:59] my citation it's not my name and i'm like this has to be a mistake right it's not on my dd214
[03:53:05] it's not your citation it's not your name no it's just like i jumped on a tank and you know i suppressed
[03:53:10] the enemy it's basically the silver star was for stepping in the doorway with a saw got it and then
[03:53:16] there's something with a bradley that i didn't do and then my middle my name is spelled wrong
[03:53:21] but it's not on my dd214 and the orders aren't signed so i'm like you know what's going on and now
[03:53:28] everyone's like you're gonna get the medal of honor and the media is like this is happening
[03:53:33] the silver star it's an interim award and you're gonna hold on to that and then you're gonna get
[03:53:39] the medal of honor well that goes on forever and then nothing happened and so people so what are you
[03:53:47] doing so now it's you're out of the army i'm out of the army uh i i decide i want to go back in the
[03:53:53] army um but i don't want to i have a family and i want to be a dad i want to get a normal job and
[03:53:59] then i hear so you're conflicted conflicted i go and become an embedded reporter uh i start a veterans
[03:54:07] group we start running democrat republican veterans for congress we have a great class
[03:54:13] lee zeldin who's running for governor in new york was one of our first guys alan west was one of
[03:54:17] our first guys uh we've had some good ones we've had some bad ones but we we ran you know quality
[03:54:23] guys and and and girls and in the process of doing that i meet all of these like there's a class that
[03:54:31] is started where there's like a professional veteran class that comes out of afghanistan and
[03:54:35] iraq and i'm super cognizant that i don't want to be that guy i don't want to be the dd214 guy in my
[03:54:41] car you know i don't want to be the guy that's low crawling to the copier you know it's like hey
[03:54:48] what time well zero niner we're gonna like stop another brief all right like you work at an
[03:54:54] office depot like you did not have an actual depot and so i i don't want to be that guy and i want
[03:55:01] to be like a normal guy but every time something happens with the war my local newspaper my local
[03:55:07] whatever is like this guy's getting the medal of honor and then people want to write books
[03:55:13] and the books they're writing are not the stories that happened they're like you know then you know
[03:55:20] he's killed eight people single-handedly uh but that's one story do you know how many people
[03:55:26] are killed over here and it's like wait a second first of all how much money you get what's going
[03:55:32] on here like you're making money off of our friends our stuff what's why are you sharing these stories
[03:55:40] they're not true and then i got to hang out with guys like marcus letrell and i saw the veteran side
[03:55:52] of celebrity in a way that made me super grateful for my life because marcus was a 50 50 50 percent
[03:56:01] of the country's thought marcus letrell is truly one of the greatest treasures we have in our planet
[03:56:07] he's a humble decent wonderful man that went through some crazy things and then 50 percent
[03:56:13] were like i hate him because he's successful and known why is he famous why do i care about marcus
[03:56:21] letrell and i'm watching him go through this and i'm seeing that for every guy that wants to shake
[03:56:28] his hand for every girl that wants his phone number there are 50 people that want to put him
[03:56:33] in jail and there's 30 people that want to call him a fraud and go after his story go after his
[03:56:40] friends and he's doing this journey and it's like he's a pioneer like he's discovering the organ
[03:56:47] trail and he's doing it all by himself uncharted waters uncharted waters with grace and dignity
[03:56:54] and he can't win every everyone's out to to to to snipe him and i remember he told me one day
[03:57:03] we were in texas doing something and he said you are so lucky it's not the medal of honor
[03:57:09] because it's crazy as this is the medal of honor to be worse and i'm like you know what maybe you're
[03:57:14] right i'm blessed salgianta first living recipient i see this guy he's on that's a super bowl he's
[03:57:23] on the letterman show and i look at his face and i'm like this guy has got the weight of the world
[03:57:31] and he is just just getting buzzsawed i mean there's you're the great you can't take anything away
[03:57:38] from salgianta what he stands for what he did who he is how he leads his but there's still people
[03:57:44] don't want to just rip him to shreds and go after his unit and his decisions and does he well i heard
[03:57:50] he was i come on man give the guy and he's the only one and there's no net there's no support
[03:57:56] there's no one he could talk to vietnam guy nothing just gianta on his own doing his own thing
[03:58:03] and i said thank god this one i was like i'm and then it became well maybe the story isn't true
[03:58:13] i mean you didn't you didn't get the award that they said you're gonna get it so they did the
[03:58:18] investigation and obviously you didn't do shit this is bullshit right so now i'm like wait a second
[03:58:23] well i go from going from being like the susan luci of combat veterans i'm nominated for a daytime
[03:58:29] emmy for 18 years i'm not kidding it it's an honor to be nominated now when did you do your
[03:58:35] embedded reporting so so this is six so 2006 you're freaking in ramadi when i'm there yeah no so that
[03:58:44] which is crazy and mcmajor mcmajor mcclung was the pao who lost her life in the for the marines
[03:58:50] and i thought i got approved because i'm like the only guy that wants to be there and at the end of
[03:58:57] that tour at the end of that little time she said will you sign my time magazine and i was like no
[03:59:04] way like she's like yeah come on what do you think we're stupid like yeah you show up here no one
[03:59:09] wants to be here we just wanted to make sure you weren't coming here to be a hero and you weren't
[03:59:15] coming here to do something stupid and when it was appeared you know it was apparent that you had
[03:59:19] your heart in the right place we thought you could you could use your platform to tell them what we're
[03:59:25] doing because we're doing great things in ramadi no one's talking about it at all what was it like
[03:59:29] when you were on the ground there and ramadi yeah that was the worst place i've ever been in my life
[03:59:33] i would i would take ramadi i would get an apartment in falusia before in 2006 ramadi was insane
[03:59:41] and and i'm not telling you anything you don't know but i'm you know as you're sometimes you don't
[03:59:46] sometimes you you can go through something that's really bad compared to another bad thing but
[03:59:50] unless you have the perspective to know like okay i saw the army the marine corps and the seals right
[03:59:59] right there was no difference the only time you can tell elite people just by the way they move
[04:00:08] you know the fluid nature of how special operations do their thing the rangers incredible
[04:00:15] marse the marine special operations marsok um you know all these guys recon these are some
[04:00:22] studs right i i never was in an area where i could not tell because of just the over the just
[04:00:32] on the disproportionate amount of brazen enemy attacks you could not differentiate
[04:00:40] what unit they were attacking until 40 minutes into the fight and the objectives were being
[04:00:45] pushed and you and you could actually see it was that crazy it could have been a hundred first could
[04:00:49] have been third marines it could have been navy seals there are 60 guys running around doing
[04:00:56] whatever the hell they want to do and it is just snipers in hides that was where we found the guy
[04:01:05] on a on a table with a hole cut in the table and there was human waste human urine
[04:01:13] hooked up with ivy bags and someone just went in there and threw water on the blanket
[04:01:17] it i mean the dedication to just lay in a hide with an ivy for your food
[04:01:26] that was ramon he was nuts and you know the the cement truck bombs the video of it no one was
[04:01:34] covering it we had a a time was just balcony journalism you heard a story a stringer gave you
[04:01:40] a video of an id you put it on the news nothing on the ground nothing tactical uh are we winning
[04:01:47] ramon he was a fight that actually was like an anaconda just squeezing the life
[04:01:54] out of these insurgents and the more you killed you saw a clear reduction of violence i mean a
[04:02:00] clear reduction of violence like you might have five got you couldn't recruit when you just had
[04:02:06] that kinetic fight the snipers were crazy the mortars were crazy uh it wasn't um and the civilian
[04:02:15] population was was still there but you saw the beginning of the sons of iraq you saw the beginning
[04:02:21] of the ambar awakening in 2006 but most importantly you saw the population see enemy combatants
[04:02:31] that were mushadine as the actual occupiers that was the first time it was ramonio six when
[04:02:39] americans are like they're the bigger tribe they're not going anywhere they're good people
[04:02:44] they're honest they just want to be left alone play the game work the job do whatever take their
[04:02:51] money but these guys from syria i don't want them i don't want these guys coming in from wherever
[04:02:57] they're the occupiers get a ran out get these people out um and and we'll be fine but ramonio it
[04:03:06] was not a good place and and it was uh it was also weird to see people lose their life and watch
[04:03:14] someone mourn someone that i didn't know like i'd never been around someone who was hurt or killed
[04:03:22] that i didn't have a connection to and to watch that extremely personal you feel like a stranger
[04:03:30] you feel like um you're intruding that that's not why we're we're there when that's a very
[04:03:39] personal thing and that was that was really crazy too and when i was in ramonio had a kidney stone
[04:03:46] and i remember being medivac'd by one of the seals out there and the last thing he told me i mean i
[04:03:54] was trying to i didn't want to drink their water because then i it was weird because like they don't
[04:03:59] want they don't want you there like no one cares about you you can be missing for days and they're
[04:04:04] like when i don't know okay move on and and so they were like i'm gonna buy you a drink and i was like
[04:04:11] yeah that'd be i i guess he meant he was gonna give me pain meds but when i came to i was on the
[04:04:17] on the shoulder of a grown man who's thinking please don't know who i am you know i mean like i
[04:04:24] don't want to be the guy from time magazine that's being carried off like you know a sandbag but
[04:04:29] but they did surgery on me there and removed the stones and gave me a a catheter and a i had stents
[04:04:37] put in it was nuts and then they sent me back out into ramonio and i remember this guy this guy
[04:04:45] came up to me he's like hey i got your flow max do you need flow max like you guys are issuing flow
[04:04:51] max prescription started this we have evolved since 2004 but that i i got to see the hospitals and
[04:05:00] the surgical units and how hard those men and women work and the ground units but the people of
[04:05:05] ramonio gave me hope that this is actually going in the right direction i couldn't say that about
[04:05:10] diala diala was worse and and i went back to diala in 08 same area that i fought in i went back to
[04:05:17] felusion 06 didn't really seem all that great i mean it wasn't better and then in 2008 i went back
[04:05:27] to felusion and they had a fight at a city council meeting over solar lights for their
[04:05:32] traffic signals and i was thinking damn we uh they're more green than we are you know that's
[04:05:38] for sure but yeah the moral of story is uh when when i got out the award i didn't know what was
[04:05:48] happening with it and it everyone kind of turned the media at least people were like this isn't
[04:05:53] real this you're bullshitting this story is not true you know gerber would have given you a knife
[04:06:01] by now you know like this there's something would have happened like this this doesn't make any sense
[04:06:05] and yet everyone said there was a tape there's a tape out there and i didn't have a relationship
[04:06:12] with michael where but they're like there's a tape out there and i'm thinking oh what's on the tape
[04:06:17] show me what's in the box what's on the tape like is it good is it bad like i don't i don't want to
[04:06:22] you know do whatever and then uh he sold his documentary and when he sold his documentary
[04:06:28] uh everyone started talking about it again and the book started reading the book and they wanted
[04:06:35] to make it a movie they wanted to do all these different things and i thought this is i'm getting
[04:06:39] into the territory that i was really happy i never was in and uh then you got dakota and
[04:06:47] everything he went through and kyle and you know all these guys will swenson and you know just it
[04:06:53] just seemed like half of the population was like at a boy here's a free ticket to disneyland and the
[04:06:58] rest of them were like i'm gonna hunt you down and make sure you can never work a job again
[04:07:04] it's such a schizophrenic world man and so 2018 i'm minding my own business and i get these
[04:07:11] calls before you get there though so what do you mean there's a huge amount of time that's
[04:07:14] passing by so it's now 2005 2006 you're doing some reporting 2008 you're doing reporting yeah so i was
[04:07:21] i worked in washington i started a veterans group called vets for freedom pete hegseth fox news
[04:07:27] we had marcus was a part of that uh there was all these guys that we tried to just get the politics
[04:07:33] out of war fighting you know send us to fight and if you don't like it don't vote to send us but
[04:07:38] you can't defund a war while we're in the process of fighting it and then uh i i just i i wanted to
[04:07:45] go back home i wanted to be a dad i wanted to coach soccer and i wanted to just see my kids and this
[04:07:49] is what we fought for so i just became a normal you know a guy i worked at a milk plant i was doing
[04:07:57] you know advocacy work for like the power grid you know like nothing crazy like you can't be against
[04:08:03] protecting the power grid you know what i mean and uh working at a milk plant everything was cool um
[04:08:10] and then an opportunity came up to do some radio and i'm in buffalo and i love my hometown i love
[04:08:17] the bills i love everything about buffalo and uh i was like hey you know what when i'm on the radio
[04:08:24] no one's talking about the army i'm weather traffic guy so in a way so wait you were weather
[04:08:30] traffic guy no no i'm just saying i'm talking about just cat decline and you know plastic bags
[04:08:35] like nothing remotely you know if they did you write a book yeah yeah but let's talk about this
[04:08:40] cats and these claws why are we decline cats it's like cutting their fingers off are you happy with
[04:08:45] yourself and in a way i could control my narrative i you didn't know what i look like you just hurt
[04:08:54] it every day and yet i controlled what you knew about me and if you wanted to ask me a question
[04:08:59] about something i don't want to talk about i just switched to start hung up on you you know i didn't
[04:09:04] have to be on facebook i didn't have to go nuts i didn't you know you want to talk about the war
[04:09:11] and you know there's moments where you have a book out you go out fox you talk about the end of the
[04:09:16] war the way obama ended the war bush what do you think about this what do you think about
[04:09:20] trump what do you think about the caliphate those are things you know you feel like doing them or
[04:09:24] you don't but i'm not a professional veteran and that chunk of my life was amazing you know and
[04:09:32] then i started going through all the things all my friends were going through you know chuck yeager
[04:09:36] dies at what 99 what do they talk about the sound barrier is 24 dude we're talking chuck yeager's
[04:09:43] entire life and we're talking about when he was 24 it's a sound barrier well give him the
[04:09:48] shit he had kids he had a job he had businesses nobody wants to talk about chuck yeager they want
[04:09:54] to talk about when you're 24 and you start to realize that if you live your life in that moment
[04:10:00] that's all you're gonna be and everyone's going through what i'm going through went through a
[04:10:05] divorce divorce sucks war sucks you move on you meet new people you have new relationships
[04:10:13] but i never i figured that the guys were the war my old unit my old life was the thing that i'm
[04:10:20] burying in a time capsule and so those guys the more i heard about them the more there were
[04:10:27] problems i'm not your squad leader anymore i i can't help you anymore it's time to move on
[04:10:36] and then all of a sudden i get these phone calls from guys i haven't talked to in forever
[04:10:41] guys the pentagon people i met you know in washington or overseas and they're like do you
[04:10:47] hear what's happening which is like the worst way to start a conversation did you hear what they're
[04:10:51] doing to you they knew a lot of information they had a lot of stuff and your your initial
[04:10:58] thought was they're investigating you from they were investigating they're asking questions well
[04:11:02] i'm not i don't even know who you are you're calling me on the phone you're asking me did you
[04:11:05] think the medal of honor just was never gonna happen at some point did you figure all right
[04:11:09] it's yeah what year did you approximately say hey you know what it's been four years this
[04:11:15] shit ain't happened i got my silver star with my name missed out there was a guy all the metal
[04:11:20] living in recipients were afghanistan and the obama administration was very clear that iraq was
[04:11:27] the bad war afghanistan was a good war we don't talk about iraq the caliphates moving throughout
[04:11:33] the country no one wants to revisit iraq we're making iraq movies that we avoided because it was too
[04:11:39] close to reality now you know superman's making the movies and you know ramadi like all these things
[04:11:46] were happening that the culture was just like no more iraq and it was okay and this was like 2010
[04:11:53] or something where you like i'd say 2010 that it was like okay fine and by the way i saw what happened
[04:12:00] to marcus i saw what was happening to all these other guys i mean they savaged dakota mayer for
[04:12:06] there's absolutely nothing no one can rationalize why that guy goes from american hero on a pedestal
[04:12:15] you know you you take wil swenson and dakota mayer each branch of service you get more for the exact
[04:12:22] same thing you don't think that's weird for those two guys you you don't think you're creating uh why
[04:12:28] are you doing that you can't say that wil swenson did something incredible that day dakota mayer
[04:12:33] did something incredible that day no that's not what you do you make it about branch rivalry you
[04:12:39] take two guys you're digging into people's lives this is trauma this is this is their identity
[04:12:46] right and then dakota decides to be a man and get married and because he married someone we got to
[04:12:53] put on tmz he's now a celebrity that gets followed by gossip magazines come on dude this is these kids
[04:13:00] are young they got their whole lives in front of them you're lucky they didn't end up you know
[04:13:05] you like a elvis in some vegas hotel just you know eating peanut butter sandwiches i mean
[04:13:13] you can't do that to young people and not give them the the opportunity to become normal again
[04:13:20] these guys can't work normal jobs they can't be normal you don't want them to be normal you want
[04:13:26] to exploit them to sell war bonds but then when they make money or they become successful you attack
[04:13:33] them for being horrors and i mean it's it's unsustainable and it and it's horrible to see it's
[04:13:38] like watching a slow movie freight train a baby playing with a you know stick a dynamite and
[04:13:45] you're watching this and all i could think of is my heart breaks for these guys i know them all to
[04:13:51] be honorable wonderful men but i'm so glad i'm not there i'm so glad that for whatever reason my
[04:13:57] path was different and i could just control it you know i love that and then it became a parent
[04:14:05] that not only was this going to be serious but reporters the same reporters going after navy
[04:14:13] seals for you know doing silly things the same guys loving the leavenworth dudes that were getting
[04:14:19] thrown in jail uh these reporters were like hey tell me about this incident tell me about this tell
[04:14:25] me about that and i'm like you know what you can all eat a bag of hot i am i'm loyering up dude
[04:14:33] you're not touching me not touching me right and these guys are like dude one of two things
[04:14:38] is happening either you're going to go to jail for 40 years or you're going to be the ambassador
[04:14:43] to france like we've never seen this before like there no one wants to acknowledge anything
[04:14:48] so i'm doing the radio show one day my contest line blows up like we give tickets to manheim steam
[04:14:55] roller and it's some someone from army personnel that's like you must pick up the phone or we'll
[04:15:00] come to your house and i'm like army personnel like that's not like there's no criminal c i there's
[04:15:09] no cbs show is going to spawn off g1 you know the army personnel yeah adamant 71 lima on on this
[04:15:18] episode of 71 lima paychecks we're gonna figure out the housing uh you know food crisis no it's
[04:15:29] it's ridiculous and then uh they're like a senior member of the dody wants to talk to you and i'm
[04:15:35] like maybe it's a dsc right well that's awesome senior member got to be chief of staff you know
[04:15:42] whoever and then one day uh they're like are you by your phone are you by your phone i'm like yeah
[04:15:48] and they're like the senior member the dody's calling and are you suspect at this point that
[04:15:53] you think it's the dsc you think dsc yeah yeah yeah because senior member they would just say
[04:15:58] you're getting the would just tell you i'm a girl man i mean what are we doing here it's not like
[04:16:03] let me go to the book phone rings i took a breath then answered the phone hello david an
[04:16:10] upbeat woman's voice said to me my name is madeline and i have president trump on the
[04:16:15] line wishing to speak to you is now a good time what the hell i almost said that out loud fortunately
[04:16:21] i caught myself uh uh yeah now's a good time my phone blinked suddenly heard president donald
[04:16:27] trump's voice come through my phone speaker david how are you do you know why i'm calling
[04:16:34] i'm a little nervous i admitted you should be nervous i should be nervous okay do you know
[04:16:39] what you've been recommended recommended for in that instant i knew what was coming was far more
[04:16:45] life changing than throwaway allegations the war was over i had moved on 14 years ago i was told i
[04:16:52] was nominated for the medal of honor sir a lifetime ago back then the thought of being awarded america's
[04:16:59] highest valor medal was seemingly a dream come true a validation of my skills and professionalism
[04:17:05] as a soldier it would erase the insecurities i'd wrestled with constantly and be a tangible
[04:17:09] symbol of my service to my father after all these years i could go home to him with something he
[04:17:15] could take pride in about his youngest son none of that happened well david you got it trump said
[04:17:27] just like that i mean when you it's one of two things it's alex balder from sarnay live or it's
[04:17:34] it's dial trump i mean the president states and honestly it was so surreal the moment i heard the
[04:17:41] moment you know you get a call from a flashy number and it's the switchboard of the white house
[04:17:46] then it can't be the dsc you know but the amount of cloak and dagger that's behind this thing is
[04:17:52] just so crazy and then it's not just you get in the middle of honor now which are the only guy from
[04:17:58] iraq so now this gives every weenie from the mainstream media an opportunity to be like let's
[04:18:06] re adjudicate why we went to war in iraq am i just a recipient of the middle of honor am i a mascot
[04:18:15] am i the guy that you just want to you know why is this happening why is there only one why are
[04:18:21] there so many afghanistan only one over here and you know i i i mean when you look at the timeline
[04:18:28] you know some of these guys have had the middle of honor for 10 years 15 years you know whatever
[04:18:32] why i think the old gen to was like 2012 maybe 1110 sometime around there i mean i was long out of
[04:18:39] the army when that happened so i'm the old the second oldest of the g watt recipients but i'm
[04:18:47] one of the newest recipients right and so it's like i kind of navigated all of that and kind of
[04:18:55] put that away you know maybe you do want to give it to a 23 year old go out there and enjoy it and
[04:19:01] have fun and you know get a you know buy a car dealership you know valer cars go do what you
[04:19:09] want to do with it but at this point it's like you know you're you're 35 and someone delivers a
[04:19:16] shuttling pony to your door you're like no santa i was 11 when i wanted that you know like that's
[04:19:23] it's not it's not what i did at this phase of life and then it starts happening and then every
[04:19:31] you you realize oh you know here's the key to the city and you know here's an allegation here's the
[04:19:39] you know what why why did you say this on the radio did you did you actually imply that this person
[04:19:46] should be beaten to death i mean like i've been doing the same thing for seven years come on
[04:19:53] the attention is and and then everywhere you go you're in the past tense they talk about 2004
[04:20:01] they don't want to hear about 2022 they don't want to hear about the future uh it's you know you're
[04:20:08] in a frozen in time you're at your own funeral everywhere you go and all i thought about was
[04:20:15] i went through this with 40 of the most beautiful people i've ever known in my life
[04:20:22] maybe i'll just go through with them again what if we make this award instead of being the guy
[04:20:26] that stands up there awkwardly in a uniform you've probably never worn as a soldier and you eat a
[04:20:32] bunch of shrimp and and you meet like Jimmy Kimmel right why don't you just say look i'm gonna be
[04:20:42] the guy that just constantly redirects it to the kids that got nothing right the ones that did
[04:20:49] everything i asked him to do and never received any you know maybe we just bring the band back
[04:20:57] together you know let's make the Medal of Honor about the unit why do you not go why don't you
[04:21:03] get to invite people to it you you get all these people to come to the White House but you can't
[04:21:08] invite the guys that actually were there that day why don't you want to do that you know why isn't
[04:21:14] this a unit award why don't you bring it's all of our we all did it right there was a camera there
[04:21:21] there was one guy and and uh you know it became a story that people talked about but did i do it
[04:21:29] could i have done it again i'll tell you again would i do it again knowing what this was no
[04:21:36] i would have called a bomb and waited for it patiently there's no way you want this if you
[04:21:43] are a person that is is going to live your entire life you know based on the past um i don't know
[04:21:52] of any other award where you have to wear it everywhere if you interviewed will smith and he
[04:21:57] brought the oscar you'd think he was a total douchebag you might think he's a douchebag anyway
[04:22:02] but and you might be right but my point is you don't bring that everywhere you go this is an award
[04:22:07] you're supposed to wear everywhere you're supposed to your identity this is like oh no it's there's
[04:22:14] only so many living and and there's only so many in our history and let's let's just everywhere you
[04:22:19] go it's this award first and i'm thinking to myself man that that it's the wrong there's so many let's
[04:22:28] talk about the iraq war let's actually have a discussion about what was sacrificed and what
[04:22:32] was accomplished because i'll tell you what all you people that want to ignore iraq for 10 years
[04:22:38] bagdad's more likely to host a summer olympic games than cobble is i mean can you actually look at
[04:22:44] the two wars and say that is iraq better today than the good war the war of choice in afghanistan
[04:22:51] and that's through no fault of american valour american blood but you could get a president
[04:22:56] elected tomorrow that decides ukraine's worth american treasure and blood you can get a president
[04:23:02] tomorrow that wants to hit no viscose for some reason i don't know look we don't make those calls
[04:23:07] but we fought a fight of our generation and we did it with valour we just went beyond the highest
[04:23:15] expectations of of what our military branches ask of us and i'm proud to be a part of the generation
[04:23:24] i might not have voted to go to war with iraq but i'm proud of my war and my war was iraq and i'm
[04:23:29] proud of the men i went to my i served with and uh make the award about that yeah and just to clarify
[04:23:35] you you you were the first living uh medal of honor recipient from iraq paul ray smith uh
[04:23:44] was the first recipient yeah but in that story is you know as close to audi murphy's you're gonna get
[04:23:50] it um the uh you detail this the you know as it goes from there so um first of all it's it's
[04:24:00] incredible you know as you make this decision to bring everyone in and you start reaching out to
[04:24:04] your old friends and you're you're reaching out to the gold star families the widows the moms i mean
[04:24:10] it's it's incredibly um emotional to read through it and how that goes down and what you're feeling
[04:24:19] and what you're thinking and um and then you know you get to the point where you're actually you're
[04:24:25] taking through the ceremony and i you know i attended mickey monstros medal of honor ceremony
[04:24:32] at the white house and you know was obviously honored to be able to be there for that but
[04:24:40] you just being able to read your experience and what that was like and and reflect on what i saw
[04:24:47] i mean you just did a great job of capturing the the ceremony and what happens um
[04:24:58] yeah it's it's it's a very powerful a very powerful thing and this idea that you talked about you
[04:25:04] know why not make it everybody else's award and it's not just something that you're saying right
[04:25:09] now it's what you actually did you reached out to everybody you got the band back together those
[04:25:13] those are the words that you use in the book um they allowed us to take those guys on stage oh no
[04:25:19] that was that was that was awesome that was epic that really was cool and and listen i gotta tell
[04:25:24] you i don't know i would have reacted you know they handled it with grace and love and the the
[04:25:34] ramrods of my unit were they're i don't think you know in my 20s i couldn't tell another man
[04:25:41] and you know we in the military we're super weird about you know we laugh at things that are
[04:25:48] you look at today and you're like you would never say these words or you never laugh at these jokes
[04:25:53] but expressing love in in my 20s was could not be done you couldn't go up to a guy in your 30s or
[04:26:01] your 20s in uniform and be like i love you you know don't ask don't tell just just love me write me
[04:26:09] a note or something and when you hit a certain age you realize i love you and i want to tell you that
[04:26:16] i care about you i really am proud to be in your life it's a gift that you and i are connected
[04:26:24] and no matter what happens in this world no matter what disappointment you have i know who you are
[04:26:30] i know what you're capable of i know what you've done for me and you know these the questions
[04:26:38] that i was always afraid of you know if i would have gotten this thing when i was 29 i probably
[04:26:43] would have been an idiot i probably would have you know i i i won't i won't suppose emotionally
[04:26:48] mature enough to be able to to realize that you're a product of the people you're with you know
[04:26:56] we smoke cigarettes at 14 and we blame you know peer pressure but peer pressure also makes you
[04:27:02] kick the door down peer pressure makes you clear a road ied's makes you jump out of a helicopter
[04:27:08] with a rope it depends on who your peers are if you got quality people they're gonna you're gonna
[04:27:13] be all right going with the following the herd is okay if the people are are worth it if you got
[04:27:19] dirtbags and scumbags you're gonna be an idiot so these kids are men they're all great people
[04:27:26] i'm blessed to have them in my life i'm glad we're back but you know it doesn't give you a pass and
[04:27:33] and there's always gonna be you know there's it's it's it's crazy how uh we think that something
[04:27:43] that we get is you know somehow gonna make you coast through like i think there's a mindset
[04:27:51] that you don't need to do anything anymore get a dui tomorrow and find out the first thing they say
[04:27:57] won't be you know a random guy in buffalo with a radio show it's gonna be uh you know du you know
[04:28:06] metal boner guy gets a dui as it should be don't get a dui don't be an idiot you know it's not hard
[04:28:11] to do uh yeah pretty pretty awesome um on that day when you talked about them coming on stage you
[04:28:21] say the president asked my family to join us on stage this is right after you received the metal
[04:28:25] boner this has become a traditional gesture to acknowledge the family my mother walked up to
[04:28:30] meet the president along with my brothers dan and ran and my three beloved children their mother
[04:28:35] stepped up to sharing the stage with them was unforgettable my family together in front of
[04:28:40] countless people across the world the effects of november 10th have rippled through their lives ever
[04:28:45] since even if the kids had not known it they earned this a gesture that was once an homage to them
[04:28:51] by our president and atonement for all the hardships we'd experienced as a family since my return
[04:28:56] as i stood there though my heart and head told me this needed to be first and foremost the ramrods
[04:29:04] spotlight their moment i needed to give this honor there on stage with the president to the men
[04:29:11] to mary lee and colin sims where it rightfully belonged i moved to president trump and asked him
[04:29:18] sir can i bring my ramrods up here i pointed to the audience trump was surprised this wasn't just a
[04:29:24] break in protocol this was taking a wrecking ball to it but the this president was never one to adhere
[04:29:30] rigidly to past traditions he asked how many are we talking all of them sir he looked over at them
[04:29:37] and said let's do it bring them up come on up here guys president trump rolled his hands over to
[04:29:43] welcome them get up here the ramrods flowed onto the tiny stage this felt right this wasn't my award
[04:29:49] this was our award our moment not mine we fought the battle fluge as one family we should we would
[04:29:56] share this stage as one family it reminded me i was never alone i always had them these men never
[04:30:02] betrayed me never let me down they did everything i asked of them and more they are the reason i am
[04:30:08] alive and did have my reunion with evan after all of course they were also the reason i was wearing
[04:30:15] this award there we were shoulder to shoulder one more time captain sims led the way for this moment
[04:30:23] he showed us that true leadership didn't end with our time in combat it took me 14 years to figure
[04:30:28] that out he wanted us to fight scrupulously not because he saw it as a path to victory but because
[04:30:35] he knew it was the only way we would survive the aftermath of war i had never known an officer who
[04:30:43] looked that far ahead he wasn't trying to just be our commander in iraq he felt that responsibility
[04:30:48] would be his forever as this event unfolded i understood the vision of our forever commander
[04:30:55] the medal of honor had brought us back together it was our unifying force
[04:31:06] and uh i what's pretty awesome is you can go watch this on youtube i hate to say it but you
[04:31:13] can go watch this on youtube and it's it's freaking outstanding to see it was awesome it was awesome
[04:31:18] to go through and and you know and so then uh you know the army watch it back and uh help out recruit
[04:31:24] do all those things and you know one of the things that really opened my eyes um the army is
[04:31:31] i i love my army and i and i i that's the soft spot it's always been don't let you know your
[04:31:38] army is depending on you and you want to do its best but the army also has changed a little bit
[04:31:46] and it's another generation's army it's not really my army anymore and i think that's not
[04:31:52] necessarily a bad thing but it's not a good thing you know all right and and there were times during
[04:31:59] this process where i had i had people in my life i i i wanted to be able to experience this award
[04:32:09] with with the the folks that i i had a new i had a new brotherhood of of people that i cared for
[04:32:18] for and because of the situation you know with divorce and the army and the white house getting
[04:32:24] involved and all the pr people the communications people it they were making calls and dictating
[04:32:30] decisions that weren't really putting me first right and and it's tough it's tough because you
[04:32:40] have to think well this is about the institution this is about this this is about but we're supposed
[04:32:46] we're supposed to be an organization that is lethal that's ready for the next fight and we are far
[04:32:55] too in the weeds as as an institution right now i don't know the navy or the air force or the marine
[04:33:01] corps but i could tell you that you know there is this generation we were supposed to you know
[04:33:08] they talk about that famous class in west point during the civil war that had all this experience
[04:33:13] in the mexican and the indian campaigns and how great they were in battle in the civil war because
[04:33:18] of all the experience they had that was supposed to be us after 20 years of war we're supposed to
[04:33:25] have the best generals and the best kernels because every one of these young lieutenants cut
[04:33:29] their teeth in combat we didn't have it after the gulf war they all went away and and you had
[04:33:35] peacetime and peace is great we love peace we fight for peace but my god we are hemorrhaging
[04:33:41] far too many light kernels and majors that are just saying it's not worth it and the guys that's
[04:33:49] sticking around for four stars i worry that in 10 years they're the ones that need it
[04:33:55] they got nothing else to do there was a time when our four star generals were the best of they were
[04:34:02] ceo's you know i just saw one retired the other day this guy could work anywhere in the country
[04:34:08] he's that good and paul funk is one of the greatest generals the armies ever seen what's
[04:34:14] going to happen in 10 years are we going to have the best of the best or are we going to have people
[04:34:18] that just hung out long enough survivor island they kept on held on to the torch and they're there
[04:34:26] it's it's it's uh it's sad but i i want my command star majors to all have been privates in romani
[04:34:33] and felucia i want my generals to have been lieutenants in cabal and in afghanistan we don't
[04:34:42] we're losing it well that would certainly be a an ideal thing and uh speaking of ideal things you
[04:34:52] get you ended up giving a speech and this speech the next day this is at the hall of heroes at the
[04:34:58] pentagon and you end up giving this speech it's uh it's an amazing speech it's if it's an amazing
[04:35:04] speech it's got a bunch of views again once again you can go watch this um but you in the speech
[04:35:12] a lot of is that you just paying a tribute to the men you fought alongside and you pay homage to
[04:35:20] all the services but there's one part of the speech that i think it captures what you just
[04:35:27] said of what the ideal what the what the american military is supposed to be
[04:35:34] and i just want to read this real quick you say this and go watch this whole speech on youtube
[04:35:41] you say this the entire military is one cohesive dedicated force and the threats to our nations
[04:35:47] they don't sleep they're watching our every move iran russia china north korea isis al-qaeda
[04:35:55] they may be watching this right now our military should not be mistaken for a cable news gab fest
[04:36:05] show we don't care what you look like we don't care who you voted for who you worship what you
[04:36:12] worship who you love it doesn't matter if your dad left you millions when he died or if you knew
[04:36:18] who your father was we have been honed into a machine of lethal moving parts that you would be
[04:36:25] wise to avoid if you know what's good for you we will not be intimidated we will not back down
[04:36:34] we've seen war we don't want war but if you want war with the united states of america
[04:36:41] there's one thing i can promise you so help me god someone else will raise your sons and daughters
[04:36:50] we fight so our children never have to we fight for one day when our children and our enemies
[04:36:57] children can discuss their differences without fear or loathing we fight so that anyone out there
[04:37:04] thinking about raising arms against our citizens or allies realizes the futility of attrition
[04:37:11] against a disciplined professional and lethal force built to withstand anything you can dream of
[04:37:17] throwing at us americans want this kind of country americans want this kind of world and we stand
[04:37:27] ready to defend it to protect us so help us god may god bless this beautiful army
[04:37:35] may god bless our marine corps our navy our air force and our coast guard
[04:37:43] may god bless our allies and we already know that god blessed america because he gave us
[04:37:51] the greatest fighting force this world has ever seen two two infantry and the first infantry
[04:37:58] division thank you ramrod's duty first dukes
[04:38:12] again to me that's the military that i tried to join that's the military i tried to
[04:38:19] represent when i was in and many of the those i served alongside that's exactly the way they felt
[04:38:25] and you captured it um incredibly i appreciate that um little editorializing at the end of
[04:38:34] the greatest fighting force the world's ever seen you know that might be hyperbole but my point in
[04:38:39] in that is that you know i think we're all raised differently in the in the military our leaders
[04:38:46] gave us tough love but now that we're out we're still ambassadors and it's very very important
[04:38:52] that people start to see veterans you know we're not some infomercial for sally struthers
[04:39:00] for 99 cents a month private snuff he can get a cup of coffee you know what i mean like we got uh
[04:39:06] you know like wounded dogs and cages and building houses i love those institutions
[04:39:13] but we're gonna run out of houses to build we're gonna run out of wounded men and women who gave
[04:39:18] us everything for our country god bless their sacrifice god bless their service but i don't
[04:39:24] want a cottage industry of you watch a recruiting commercial it's followed by a guy lost his limb
[04:39:32] trying to open his kitchen cabinet i mean that's a really schizophrenic message to send to america's
[04:39:38] young people how do you honor service and sacrifice without bookending it next to a commercial saying
[04:39:45] join us and we too will give you a kitchen countertop that allows you to cook in front of your family
[04:39:50] in case the worst thing happens hey listen everyone knows what's going on with service and the men
[04:39:58] and women who have sacrificed who've been out there they empower us they're they're walking vessels
[04:40:05] of valor our generational valor no one should cheapen that no one should denigrate that buy
[04:40:11] them two houses and an additional car in fact take it from iraq let let the iraqi people pay
[04:40:19] reparations for our dead and are injured i'm all about it i have no problems with that at all
[04:40:25] but at the same time we still have to have a warrior class in america and this is just the
[04:40:33] victimization of veterans is something that just absolutely a fine repugnant and it's not helping
[04:40:39] us it's not making us more deadlier or more lethal on the battlefield it's not intimidating our
[04:40:45] adversaries and it's not bringing peace to our allies it's it's it just shows that well eventually
[04:40:50] america will get it eventually we'll understand that the greatest generation was the greatest
[04:40:56] generation of american because they knew they were at war and they had to do everything to win their war
[04:41:03] you want to say no to war forever i'll be with you i don't want to see war again
[04:41:07] but if this is going to happen it's got to be overwhelming devastating and a reminder to your
[04:41:13] future generation go to dental school and learn a trade don't fight against americans because it is
[04:41:21] going to end in tears every single time and i just don't think we're that military anymore and i
[04:41:26] don't think our elected officials want us to be that military anymore you know hearing the stories
[04:41:33] of people joining our military to get hormone therapy it's it's like what are you doing your
[04:41:43] combat ineffective you can't deploy why would i why would i want you in my team what do you do i
[04:41:51] want a college degree font you want to cause you're fantastic you want to be a citizen fantastic
[04:41:56] you want to better yourself better your community better your country i'm all about giving you the
[04:42:02] tools to make your society better for serving you're not bettering yourself because you're selfish
[04:42:11] and you see yourself in a different light and this is what's best for me it's not best for your
[04:42:16] community it's not best for your country it's best for you and that's the opposite it's literally 180
[04:42:22] degrees from what we're supposed to be and i just don't know why more people aren't standing up
[04:42:27] standing up especially you know our generation saying just because i'm who we are does not offend you
[04:42:37] i mean representing our true self of what the military is and what veterans do
[04:42:43] is not something it invokes pride right it gives us swagger it gives us security it gives us pride
[04:42:50] it gives us patriotism if it's offensive to you that's the problem that's your problem it's not
[04:42:57] it's not the institution's problem i'm so sick and tired of having to apologize for what what do
[04:43:03] you want me to do you know the first question that we got asked uh when we did the whole little
[04:43:07] media thing after the Medal of Honor is what do you say to the families who lost loved ones in
[04:43:13] iraq or afghanistan and i'm thinking to myself the fact that you have to ask that just shows me i mean
[04:43:22] what are you goose stepping with you know what side you tell a family member that their loved
[04:43:29] one died so that we could live that's what happened their sacrifice could have been any one of us
[04:43:36] they put themselves in a position so that we could have a tomorrow and a future and if that
[04:43:42] is difficult for you to understand then i'm glad you never served honestly the part of me wants
[04:43:49] to think that maybe we think we're better than civilians and other parts want to say well some
[04:43:54] people can't do this some people don't want to do this i get all of it but there are certainly people
[04:43:59] that are offended by people who make the choice to serve their country or serve in you know any
[04:44:06] sector of first responders or any of these other folks they're just offended by everything
[04:44:13] and i honestly i don't even give a damn about i mean you're you're just a a vacuous non-entity
[04:44:18] at the end of the day if you're not going to put the fire out if you're not going to help
[04:44:22] tell everyone there's a fire and all you want to do is comment on why the fire got put out
[04:44:29] then you're just a jackoff like there's no there's no there's nothing in the chain that says i need
[04:44:35] more of that so stop acting like you're on an equal platform with a disabled veteran you know
[04:44:43] let's give a service dog to everyone if you need a dog get a dog i'm not offended you have a
[04:44:48] dog i don't think you need a potbelly pig i think you're being obnoxious with a peacock i think when
[04:44:54] you brought a bull with fairy shrimp in it you're just being an ass i mean we we can differentiate
[04:45:00] between the people that need to be put on a pedestal and the people that just want to be
[04:45:06] acknowledged for being different they wanted to serve they love our country they love our family
[04:45:12] we're all different walks of life but that doesn't mean that we're not proactive to people that
[04:45:18] are obviously trying to get in the way of this family tradition today if you're joining the
[04:45:24] marine corps the army it's because your dad did it because your uncle did it why isn't this a
[04:45:29] decision everyone is making you you have an obligation to go to college everyone has an
[04:45:35] obligation well you got what you're not going to college what's wrong with you what do you mean
[04:45:40] you're not going to college there obviously you're not serious about succeeding in life it's
[04:45:45] ridiculous and then you think yourself why isn't every single 18 year old saying i'm going to do
[04:45:51] my two years and find myself i'm going to learn about people and be uncomfortable and be different
[04:46:00] and sacrifice and see the world and see different people and be surrounded by diversity and difference
[04:46:07] i don't have to force the diversity it's already there there's diversity everywhere right and it's
[04:46:14] in the military it's in every walk of life there's diversity embrace it it's beautiful but it's
[04:46:21] different and you have to be exposed to that different to grow i don't understand why every
[04:46:26] able-bodied person isn't saying i want some of that i want to be better i want to take care of
[04:46:33] myself i want individual ruggedness i want to be tough i want to survive right and and you've got a
[04:46:40] generation of website developers that that you know i mean seriously if a zombie apocalypse
[04:46:48] happens i look at there was a time when you know a person said i want a partner who's going to be
[04:46:53] there for me when it all goes down and now that decision isn't i want someone who who what
[04:47:03] look i understand that you know things have changed we can't change we have to be the same
[04:47:09] yesterday today forever and the military cannot adapt to this schizophrenic nature of hey today
[04:47:18] we believe the following individuals you know are a protected class today we believe the following
[04:47:26] individuals can reproduce today we believe the following i mean you want to kick out 15 000
[04:47:32] people for vaccinations what did you do with anthrax did you dishonorably discharge them
[04:47:38] what did you tell them you said you don't want the anthrax well you know you're not going to defend
[04:47:44] your country with all the people you trained with for a year why don't you take the anthrax
[04:47:50] that was the choice mm-hmm am i going to not deploy with these men that i consider family to me
[04:47:56] because what i don't know what anthrax is if anthrax was naturally occurring outside of training
[04:48:03] grounds in san diego would people not respect you know this vaccination thing to me is is a is a is a
[04:48:12] object lesson and how we have completely decided that we want our universe instead of our university
[04:48:19] is becoming more like our our military we're deciding to make the military plug and play
[04:48:26] to everything that's happening in society and unfortunately the enemy gets a vote
[04:48:30] and the enemy doesn't give a damn about inclusiveness or feeling good the enemy wants to kill you
[04:48:38] they want to kill you as quickly as they possibly can and i don't want a military that feels good
[04:48:45] at the end of the day about who they are i want the military to feel good about who they are because
[04:48:49] they dominated the battle space and americans don't know what a mortar incoming or outgoing sounds like
[04:48:55] right that's a problem yeah i mean um the military has one purpose
[04:49:03] and that's to be able to fight destroy the enemy that's what it is and if you if you're doing things
[04:49:09] to the military that don't enhance that capability it's a problem and if you know you said that the
[04:49:17] enemy doesn't care what they're doing what we're doing actually they do care what we're doing
[04:49:20] and they're trying to encourage it as much as possible they want us to be as weak as they can
[04:49:26] possibly make us they can get drugs over the border they can put uh uh programs on your phone that
[04:49:32] that fill your brain with a bunch of stuff that makes you think things that are not healthy
[04:49:37] like that stuff's actually happening that's actually happening so hopefully well i'll tell you one
[04:49:44] thing these books that you've written um in my estimation any 15 to 23 year old male that reads
[04:49:55] these books will be encouraged to move in the right direction because they lay out what it means
[04:50:03] and and like i said they're they're an incredible there's incredible arc between the two books
[04:50:09] and they're incredibly powerful and and this is these are stories that need to be told these are
[04:50:14] stories that need to be told so people understand what it takes and what it means and what a brotherhood
[04:50:20] is inside of a military organization and what sacrifice really is and we can never forget
[04:50:28] these things and you would think you would think the way the civilian populace sometimes behaves
[04:50:34] you'd think that these wars didn't happen they happened a couple years ago you know they happened
[04:50:42] a couple years ago and you know what they're gonna happen again they're gonna happen again
[04:50:53] and there's there's there's always going to be war there's always going to be conflict what
[04:50:56] conversation do you have if that if that does go down in five years you're talking to an 18 year old
[04:51:03] and they're like did you foresee this coming how what you go to universities i know some people
[04:51:11] don't touch the the you know vassar giving the the talks on the circuit but one of the things
[04:51:17] that young people in college will always ask you know a veteran is what can we do to prepare
[04:51:24] for the future and sometimes the answer of you need to be prepared to kill 20 communist Chinese
[04:51:31] is you know 20 million people want you dead there's a way that we can say to the Chinese government
[04:51:42] the people of China are not the enemy the people of Russia are not the enemy the people of Iraq
[04:51:47] or Afghanistan are not the enemy but no Venezuelan leader or mullah and Iran or or forever leader of
[04:51:55] China is is going to dictate what the world how the world behaves so i i don't think the i would
[04:52:05] have told you at the end that i hung up my uniform that the world was better and safer
[04:52:10] and i'm i'm disgusted that you know as we grow into our twilight our kids are gonna have to learn
[04:52:17] to shoot move and communicate and that's heartbreaking and and and i don't know what how
[04:52:23] do you have that conversation there's only one thing that's more heartbreaking than that and
[04:52:28] that is if they don't learn to shoot move and communicate because if they don't learn to shoot
[04:52:32] move and communicate that will be overrun i mean at some point you have to be able to back up
[04:52:39] with the way you want to live you don't just get to walk around the world doing whatever you want
[04:52:43] without being able to defend that way of life and if we don't maintain that ability to defend
[04:52:49] the way of life that we often take for granted here it'll go away it'll go away
[04:53:01] all right books coming out november 8th everyone buy it immediately remember the ramrods where can
[04:53:08] people find you right now what are you doing right now so uh we are uh audacy.com the david
[04:53:14] bill of via show five days a week four hours a day tons of content that is not really meant to upset
[04:53:22] anyone uh pretty pg-13 stuff but i gotta tell you i find that what i'm trying to do with my radio
[04:53:31] show is to have discourse you know i don't see the world the way a left-wing progressive sees the
[04:53:39] world i respect them i want them i need them in my culture in my society i don't want to cancel them
[04:53:47] i want to learn but i need you to understand that if we disagree we need to discuss how to
[04:53:53] disagree and there's a way that you can have a discussion with someone that you disagree with
[04:53:57] and leave it with respect and we have no ability to have discourse in the in the country today
[04:54:04] and so what i try to do with my little piece of the of the of the world is just facilitate quality
[04:54:10] critical thinking and discourse this isn't how you i disagree with x y and z inflation energy
[04:54:18] oil this is what i feel about abortion marriage wonderful i don't care what you think it really
[04:54:24] it's boring to me what you think how do you think why do you think that that's far more interesting
[04:54:31] because it always is going to come to a selfish exercise i feel this way because i robbed a bank
[04:54:37] and i would like to be reformed no bail right it's always like there's always a story that makes you
[04:54:42] have why are you against uh you know pan asian trade well i'll tell you i have a tire company
[04:54:49] and my intellectual property was it there there's always a reason for it so what you think no one
[04:54:54] cares about why you think it and how you think to me is the is the secret sauce and so what i try to
[04:55:02] do in a talk show is get 80 year old people and 20 year old people from all different walks of life
[04:55:08] to tell me you know you're transgender tell me what do you what would what what motivates you to
[04:55:15] call into a talk show what do you want people to understand because i don't get it i don't mean
[04:55:20] and i don't mean disrespect i don't understand it help me understand it no i'm not here to help you
[04:55:26] understand it i'm here to tell you you're wrong okay well i do have a problem with that because if
[04:55:31] i'm asking you to help me understand something and you refuse to that's where everyone shuts down
[04:55:38] and we label each other and we're you're this or you're that i'm just saying i want to know
[04:55:43] what where are you coming from and why is it important that i give a shit about what you where
[04:55:48] you're coming from because i bet you you don't you don't care right i could bore you for four
[04:55:54] hours with the Buffalo Bill secondary and why the Tampa two you're going to be like no one
[04:55:59] cares dude no one gives a damn i do why do you care so much about it why are you so into a football
[04:56:05] team is there anything else going on in your town maybe there isn't a chicken wings they're cool
[04:56:11] you know be fun wick is fun logan berry why do you fit feel this way why is it important that i
[04:56:17] understand where you're coming from and if i can't get your respect enough to see me as a person
[04:56:23] then i i you're not even all you're doing is uh is is annoying people no really and we have to
[04:56:32] stop annoying each other and just say look where you're coming from why because i'm a veteran
[04:56:38] does not make me better than a person it isn't a veteran and for a long time i thought that way
[04:56:43] in my heart of hearts i'm better than you right that's not true i've learned in my elder years
[04:56:50] that that's ridiculous your patriotism has nothing to do with what you did in the military out of
[04:56:55] the military right i just would like you to love the home team i think that's you know just love
[04:57:02] our team and and be supportive of it and at the end of the day if you can respect people and
[04:57:08] disagree with them man i think we could solve all of our problems right it's fun it's a little
[04:57:16] frustrating but it's fun how long is the show it's four hours a day five days a week and it's
[04:57:23] i get a lot of canadiens you know the canadiens we're close buffalo is close to toronto the
[04:57:28] canadiens no more about the constitution than we do and the canadiens have nothing but like
[04:57:33] state-run information they don't have choices so they'll be like listen let me tell you about
[04:57:39] the second amendment why it's important you know the articles of confederation didn't allow us for
[04:57:44] a standing army of like where are you from brampton you're not even you're not supposed to know any of
[04:57:51] that you know your prime minister needs a haircut like it always it's always an education and it's
[04:57:59] super fun and i think it's a great service to just say hey uh we we have to be better we can be
[04:58:06] better optimism is great it doesn't make you naive be hopeful look forward to the future but it's
[04:58:13] all about the way we conduct ourselves and our discourse and how absolutely toxic it can be
[04:58:19] by just saying nope you're one of them i don't want to hear it and uh nothing gets done after that
[04:58:29] uh to find you david bella via dot com david bella via dot com and go to odyssey dot com and
[04:58:35] what is it odyssey dot com odyssey at uh a u d ac y used to be enter com now they changed your name
[04:58:41] odyssey what about your social media do you actually have it i don't really do i mean i just for the
[04:58:47] book we started a dg bella via uh at dg bella via twitter and uh facebook one but what happens is you
[04:58:55] get all these like uh nigerians and people that create you know i'm i'm on like dating sites like
[04:59:03] i need money to get out of iraq you know could you help me so i just need a thousand bucks i'm trapped
[04:59:10] and you know in napal it's like no that's not me that's not but there's a lot of those out there but
[04:59:16] so you're not so you're on instagram too or no it's i'm on everything but dg bill dg bella via
[04:59:22] david bella via instagram uh david bella via on facebook uh all that stuff but dg bella via because
[04:59:30] there's so many accounts on twitter but uh that's that twitter but for the most part i don't really
[04:59:35] do that the social media thing is just main are you are you nuts over there i'm not nuts on it but
[04:59:40] i'm i'm on it i'm not and uh how long how long i see with the the time right right with the you
[04:59:47] know working out and stuff yeah um do you get a good response from that or do people get
[04:59:52] i don't know i mean some people chime in yeah people people chime in do you read any comments
[04:59:57] i'll you know i'll look through the comments sometimes but um you know i don't get i don't
[05:00:03] get all hyped up about what anybody says i mean if somebody says something cool i'm stoked but if
[05:00:09] there's someone that wants to you know say something negative it literally doesn't bother me at all um
[05:00:14] i just kind of like oh cool you know it's a bot you know who the bot is right so it's just a bot
[05:00:21] but there's people that get really spun up about that stuff i just look at him say that's a bot
[05:00:25] where you where you get spun up about it of computer program in russia or something that's
[05:00:29] putting that information into you uh but no i've i've found social media to be mostly good i've
[05:00:36] connected with some incredible people i mean i've had people come on the podcast that were you know
[05:00:40] vietnam uh world war two that i that i connected with them through social media so that's been
[05:00:46] awesome i get great feedback from people um what we the some some of the stuff i make i'll get feedback
[05:00:52] hey you should make this you should make that i'm like oh that sounds like a good idea i didn't
[05:00:54] really think of that i think if you go into social media with like a a positive mindset as cheesy as
[05:01:02] that sound of like okay there's gonna be some good stuff in here you're gonna find it if you go in
[05:01:07] there worried about a bunch of negativity which there's definitely gonna be uh it'll drive you
[05:01:11] crazy so i don't get wrapped around any of it wouldn't it take for you to get to that that
[05:01:16] enlightenment was it a man i was on jill rogan's podcast and jill rogan's like hey dude you know
[05:01:23] like at some point he goes hey this is the first time i was on this was 2015 and he's like dude
[05:01:28] you know when this comes out don't read the comments it's like a warning right uh and i think you
[05:01:35] know in the military you get thick skin right and so i would say i definitely had thick skin so they
[05:01:40] came out and i sat i remember i sat in my daughter my daughter's room my oldest daughter and i we
[05:01:46] were reading the comments and i was laughing hysterically because some of them were pretty
[05:01:50] freaking funny about you know i'm on the andre fall and obviously i could barely string a sentence
[05:01:55] together and all these things and i was just laughing and it seemed funny and so i think from day one
[05:01:59] a from rogan's comment like hey don't read the comments i didn't take that literally what i took
[05:02:05] it was is hey look there's going to be people that are assholes and when you read people from people
[05:02:10] that are assholes just say yeah roger that and and some of them like i said some of them are pretty
[05:02:14] funny um so it didn't take me long at all didn't take me long but you know it's a thick skin you
[05:02:20] you know you're in the military any weakness that you show is immediately getting pounced upon by
[05:02:25] your platoon mates and you're going to get torn apart so it's literally the worst defense in the
[05:02:30] world is to say ouch that really sure please don't ever mention my goiter it's going to come up 85
[05:02:37] times i've got i've got something in the world that really bothers me and i've never told anybody
[05:02:43] what it is ever and i never will i'll probably leave it in my last will intense testament say hey
[05:02:48] you all in my platoon that did this at some time or if you wanted to really piss me off if you would
[05:02:54] have done this it really would have bothered me but i'd never let you bastards know so i don't
[05:02:58] tell anybody you know so i started telling young people that you should be the same way about your
[05:03:03] dreams i think everyone should have a fake dream that they give no don't have so how do you utilize
[05:03:09] this the don't ever share what you really want to do in life it's no one's you have to protect that
[05:03:15] that's what you want what do you want to be in 10 years why the hell am i telling you there's
[05:03:20] a one school of thought of that is like when i say hey man i'm gonna lose 30 pounds and i
[05:03:26] posted on the internet hey everybody i'm gonna lose 30 pounds and then you're like oh i better
[05:03:29] lose it or else i'm gonna look like a shipper or hey i'm gonna run a marathon and i'm gonna run it
[05:03:33] on this date and so there's i forget there's a name for that you know what the name for that is
[05:03:37] uh something along the lines of public accountability public accountability so that's the thing
[05:03:42] where where you say hey my dream is to you know uh create my own or write a book right and so you
[05:03:50] tell everybody and now you kind of get pressured so what's your reasoning behind not telling people
[05:03:55] i don't i think you should protect you have people in your life trust is everything right so
[05:04:02] you have people in your life that you trust these are your life partners and everything else
[05:04:05] that's what that relationship is all about right together we're gonna raise a family
[05:04:12] we're thinking about buying a sheep farm outside of san diego it raised them together in harmony
[05:04:19] all right that when the moment you go out and start telling people this is my ambition why
[05:04:25] what i want to expose what i want or what i i'm not manifesting i don't need accountability
[05:04:33] from people if i'm losing 30 pounds again this is i think we we as a generator we're saying
[05:04:40] roughly yeah i think the social media of we are the ones that screwed up social media it's not the
[05:04:46] young kids it's the it's the gen Xers that you know in the old days um i would drive by your house
[05:04:53] and be like you're a loser right out the window and now i i stop at the driveway and i'm like let's
[05:04:59] wait for a comment it's not enough to scream you're a loser now i gotta wait in my car to be like
[05:05:04] who's gonna come out and debate me on whether or not i think you're a loser and we put things on
[05:05:10] social media that are just like we're thirsty for some sort of response that i'm proud that you're
[05:05:18] losing 30 pounds good for you you need to look you know what that's healthy who gives a damn either
[05:05:23] you're doing it because you want to do it or you're doing it because you want people to think
[05:05:27] you're doing it at the end of the day if you have a dream to be a 50 year old law school graduate
[05:05:33] shut up they should they should find out about your r&b album the day you drop it now i'm in the
[05:05:39] studio do you know what to me because all you can do is you're gonna hear for three months what the
[05:05:43] hell are you thinking chocolate's got a cookbook that's awesome let's see the day it comes out why
[05:05:51] am i telling everyone busy in the kitchen today so working on the recipe so there's where i think
[05:05:56] now i now i see uh i'm capturing or i see i see a similar vein with people where they get satisfaction
[05:06:04] just by saying you know hey i'm i've always wanted to write a cookbook i'm gonna come out with a
[05:06:08] cookbook and they get a boost from that they get a what is it a door endorphin a dopamine hit they
[05:06:15] get a dopamine hit by telling you hey man i'm writing a cookbook right now and that's enough to
[05:06:21] make me feel good that i don't actually do anything right as opposed to me not getting that instead
[05:06:28] of going and freaking hammering on my computer with my steak recipes would you would you rather have
[05:06:34] four 27 inch biceps or would you rather have vegetable oil in your arms it looks like no honestly
[05:06:40] you could look way you would look and if you were that iranian yeah yeah that guy who
[05:06:46] who doesn't think you invite him to move and he can't lift the couch he can't do anything he he
[05:06:52] has what was the equivalent for you of telling you what my dreams are don't i don't just injecting
[05:06:57] what is it what are they injecting their biceps echo child biceps expert what what was the less
[05:07:01] did you have this in the seals if you had a new girlfriend or a wife would you ever show anyone
[05:07:08] a picture of someone that you were romantically connected how long was i romantically connected
[05:07:16] to said woman the only time they should ever see your partners in person because that is the dumbest
[05:07:23] thing that is a little way that is why would you do that i want to show you who i'm dating
[05:07:28] and then you wait for like what is the responsible to be like oh my is she okay
[05:07:32] hey where is she from trinobyl you don't do that ask you hey that's weird too bro nobody
[05:07:39] asking you a picture of my girl i saw if that if that's your friend and you're like oh i heard
[05:07:44] you're dating somebody new like yeah what tell me i don't know i feel like that's normal i had a i
[05:07:49] knew a guy who had a picture of his family and and all you know his daughter and his wife they're in
[05:07:55] bikinis and i just said hey listen man you got no you got to take this picture down because it's
[05:07:59] it's not only inappropriate there's no way this is safe this is not safe for anyone they make a
[05:08:05] comment they're weird they don't make a comment they're probably normal right but why would you even
[05:08:12] do that don't ever in the military rule number one is you never show a picture of anyone you are
[05:08:20] involved with because there's no point to it it's weird i now that you're putting it to that's a
[05:08:25] horrible thing to do that was one thing when i was reading your book and you or no when you were
[05:08:28] talking today and it's also in your book like one time my my wife asked me i was on deployment
[05:08:34] it's in ramadi and my wife says oh the kids want to see a picture of where you sleep you know and i
[05:08:38] had like we had some old saddam building and we had you know built our little plywood freaking beds
[05:08:43] in there and stuff like this and so i'm like cool and i would email my wife like once a week
[05:08:48] you know a little update you know hey chow's great uh miss you blah blah blah how the kids
[05:08:54] and so i went to take a picture of where i slept at night and i realized there's like no picture so
[05:09:00] i went until like my went to my freaking locker pulled out pictures of my wife and kids pinned
[05:09:06] them up took a picture took them all down put them back in the folder put it in the drawer and shut
[05:09:10] it because that's smart just like you were talking about like the last thing i needed to be thinking
[05:09:14] about over there was my wife and kids absolutely and and that seems like a maybe that seems like
[05:09:22] it's not healthy but i think it's completely healthy you got guys depending on your decision
[05:09:25] making without a doubt it doesn't mean that you don't love it's like whenever i see a facebook
[05:09:30] profile it's like joe and kim jones and like oh no you know you're like oh so good heaven you know
[05:09:40] what i mean like you're there you don't want to be a two-headed monster you gotta have autonomy
[05:09:45] but you also have to have trust yeah i had the luxury of my wife being very i've described emotionally
[05:09:51] dependent so she didn't need me to be like telling her you know hey i hope everything's great and
[05:09:56] she was like hey i got this i got the home i got the freaking water heater when it breaks i got the
[05:10:01] whatever the toilet when it gets stopped up you handle your you know what your business overseas
[05:10:06] and i'll take care of this stuff and that was pretty very lucky yeah lucky to be in that scenario
[05:10:09] but to me and and it's the ultimate in and just you know being making those choices and putting
[05:10:16] those barriers up because there's in today's you know private sector and jobs today is absolutely
[05:10:24] no i mean like you know you bring you bring your lunch to work you don't make lunch at work
[05:10:31] you know because you don't get in the kitchen and start constructing a meal like what the hell's
[05:10:35] wrong with you you know it's like i have one the pet peeve that drives me nuts is the wet hair
[05:10:41] hair what's the wet hair anyone that shows up with wet hair like is it raining out no you have no
[05:10:49] time management there's just be late be late and present this is coming from a guy that bought a
[05:10:55] blowjarts you know i learned lessons in life but there's no reason why someone should be running
[05:11:01] into work brushing their teeth you know doing it's just i'm gonna be late and then i'm gonna show up
[05:11:07] and i'm presentable i'm ready to go this isn't a meeting with you know tribal elders the first 45
[05:11:14] minutes we're just gonna waste time talking about the weather show up be ready everything's cool
[05:11:20] you always got that guy that's going from like cubicle to cubicle asking how you doing what's
[05:11:24] going on they we have no line of like what's personal what are you doing this weekend none of
[05:11:30] your damn business bob get my my expense sheets don't you know what i mean like we're buddies you
[05:11:37] want to be friends i don't want to be friends i want to just get the get the job done you know what
[05:11:42] i mean with dry hair while we're at it yeah echo charles you got any questions i do not sometimes
[05:11:48] echo throws that curveball in the end man so you know what i mean dope of me sure yeah it's a thing
[05:11:53] it's real it's real david any closing thoughts no i want to honestly uh what you do is uh it's
[05:12:01] important to our generation and a lot of people look up to you and it's rare that you meet someone
[05:12:07] that's worthy of that there's a lot of people that have the pedestals the products this is what i want
[05:12:13] the world to see this is the person i want to be and the perception and you're legitimate you're
[05:12:21] you're who you are you who you there's no difference with a microphone is this on by the way
[05:12:29] no with when the mic when the mic job with the mic's odd it's the same and and that's it's
[05:12:36] refreshing i really was afraid that i was going to meet you and i was going to be like oh man i
[05:12:43] wonder what that guy would be like who's that guy what's that guy like i i if you've never done that
[05:12:48] we met someone and you really really thought they were just totally squared away this is someone
[05:12:53] i could look up to as a mentor and then you just like no i have done it but i'm just wondering
[05:12:59] what asshole jaco would be like who's that guy oh you can tell am i like uh i don't know what
[05:13:05] i'm what i'm doing cold what would i be doing covid jaco is that your ulterior well i had covid
[05:13:13] a couple times it was no factor no fact i remember when that when you cut a video that you had covid
[05:13:18] there was like there was controversy it's like oh what what did he do yeah what i tell you i told
[05:13:23] me be at covid people like oh he must be yo i was doing events well i like during covid there was
[05:13:30] times where i went to like the first live event that i did with covid when covid was a thing
[05:13:36] and i went to this thing it was in arizona and i forget what month it was but i went and i was
[05:13:43] thinking like oh how freaked out is everybody going to be and i wasn't freaked out of covid
[05:13:48] because i was like young and healthy and anyways i went to this event and and then they said hey
[05:13:53] can people shake your hand when you're done i'm like yeah cool and so i stepped down off a stage
[05:13:58] and they all lined up about 500 people out of a thousand or whatever and the funny thing was was
[05:14:04] there was sneeze on jaco there was a few people there's probably 10 people that had masks on as
[05:14:09] they approached me right so then they come they come up to take the picture they shake my hand
[05:14:14] they take their mask off to take the picture when they get close to me i'm like i just you know so
[05:14:20] yeah i got covid but maybe that's the the evil jaco well you would figure if you're going to be
[05:14:26] a person it's usually when you're sick or you're not in sound mind but but but those those were the
[05:14:34] viral jaco videos are not what you expect them to be they're not like the there's not it's not
[05:14:42] controversy it's just something that happened to you that people make viral because i can't believe
[05:14:49] it's like as if you had covid it was a declaration like you wanted to talk about your vaccine status
[05:14:55] there was a time when that question was asked some people didn't want to talk about it some people
[05:14:59] did some people said it's none of your business but the assumption that you had covid it meant
[05:15:04] something about vaccine status we now know it's ridiculous it's ridiculous that yankees air and
[05:15:10] judge he got covid everyone's like i can't believe you didn't get vaccinated i still do that by the
[05:15:15] way when i hear that someone gets covid i'm like why wouldn't you want to get vaccinated it's so weird
[05:15:22] like you should know better you're the vice president of the united states you should get
[05:15:27] vax i thought it's safe and effective like do it everyone's doing it
[05:15:33] but i'm telling you it kills me i i love that i remember that moment specifically
[05:15:38] when everyone was was asking like what was he doing yeah well as you know from doing radio
[05:15:42] four hours a day you can't pretend to be someone for four hours a day and just like on this podcast
[05:15:47] you can't come on here i can't come on here and talk for hours and hours and like be in some character
[05:15:52] mode where i'm pretending to be someone that i'm not i think it would be hard for me but there's a
[05:15:57] lot of mme guys a lot of guys that just are not i mean look i i i love the sport and i think
[05:16:06] those guys are tim kennedy's one of the coolest guys totally i mean i love that dude he's funny
[05:16:11] he's just a maniac yeah but there are a lot of people that just aren't tough people the the the
[05:16:19] facade is they're tough but they're not tough you know what i mean and i just think that that's
[05:16:27] it's cool that there's no you know you don't you don't have to put that out there it's it's
[05:16:33] genuine it's real and you don't have to to you don't have this is not a podcast an interview show
[05:16:40] the podcast format is like this is how jacos sees the world you know let me tell you what i like
[05:16:47] i like fudge i like fudge i like cookies and i like pumpkin pie and then you do a podcast about
[05:16:53] just you you're sharing this platform with a lot of people giving opportunities um putting the light
[05:17:00] that's on you and other people helping people sharing ideas being consistent it's important it's
[05:17:05] appreciate i don't know if you get enough but i really do appreciate this and i appreciate you
[05:17:10] you're letting me be a part of it and everything you continue to do because it means a lot seeing
[05:17:15] people that you emulate turn out to be honorable and decent is awesome so thank you you i don't know
[05:17:22] about i'm nobody does okay that's how he likes it that dopamine thing scared me he had that way too
[05:17:28] quick it's real he's called dopamine yes sir right well man uh uh it's you know i've said this a
[05:17:36] couple times and on this podcast i mean if you could sit down and talk with john basalone for three
[05:17:43] four five hours like what i wouldn't give to be able to do that so he's from buffalo yeah i love
[05:17:50] that so to be able to sit here and talk to you for you know however many hours we've been going um
[05:17:56] it's just an honor and i know that so many people are going to learn so much from this
[05:18:01] so thanks for coming on thanks for the lessons learned um thanks for your service obviously
[05:18:07] thanks for your leadership and thanks for the example that you set for for everyone in the army
[05:18:12] and and everyone in the military and really for the citizens of our country of how to be
[05:18:20] how to be honorable that means that means a lot and i really appreciate that my last question for
[05:18:26] you i'm gonna let you go if you could do it over again what what elite branch do you think how would
[05:18:36] you rank them the the all the branches and each one of the elite branches they all have great guys
[05:18:44] who's the one group though that you worked with it said and you thought these guys are like that
[05:18:50] were equals well i worked with special forces guys that are better than me i worked with marines that
[05:18:57] were better than me i work with uh whom i'm missing i work with army rangers that were better i worked
[05:19:03] with i've worked with guys from the 101st that were better than me guys from the 137 that were
[05:19:07] better than me there's there's studs in all these groups i've also worked with every one of those
[05:19:12] groups that with guys that were not as good with guys that you didn't want to go on a mission with
[05:19:17] you so to me there's great incredible guys in in in all units and and then there's also in all units
[05:19:27] there's people that are are crap but just as as as as institutionally delta you got the you know
[05:19:35] uh mars okay you got the uh air force specialize right individuals there's gonna be good and bad
[05:19:44] but the one group that you looked at and said wow if i wasn't a seal i'd want to be that that's if i
[05:19:50] wasn't a seal if you weren't a seal can't be a seal i mean there's a you didn't get the vaccination
[05:19:54] they kicked you out yeah actually they let them all stay in thank god uh if i wouldn't if i wouldn't
[05:20:02] have joined the navy i most likely would have joined the marine corps uh just because like every
[05:20:08] well like most of the young men i grew up with when you looked at the marine corps you thought
[05:20:13] hey it's the marines yeah because they do such a good job with their culture and with their image
[05:20:19] and and the marine corps an outstanding group and so i probably would have ended up in the marine
[05:20:24] corps and if i wouldn't end up in the marine corps i would have been in the army because
[05:20:27] it's the same thing uh let's see i'm dodging again now i'm feeling like i'm dodging your question
[05:20:33] i don't know who i would actually what if your daughter said she wanted to go what would you
[05:20:37] suggest if my daughter said she wanted to go into special operations no she wanted to join the
[05:20:42] military what branch would you think would you want your daughter in uh the air force you know
[05:20:47] no without making that a punchline why is that well uh my i'm just my oldest daughter came to
[05:20:55] mind um she's very analytical she's really smart i think that she could bring a lot to the table
[05:21:01] in that kind of environment probably be in an intel officer she's really good at
[05:21:04] assimilating information and she'd probably be really good at that job so there you go yeah
[05:21:13] no because i could always and i would be horrible at that job you know analytical no just being
[05:21:17] being an intel officer in the air force i don't think it would be a good fit for me
[05:21:22] do you think have you ever been could you be a pilot are you too big to be a pilot uh because
[05:21:26] they're kind of like jockeys a little bit yeah they're a little bit like jockeys uh one of my
[05:21:30] really good friends is a is a top gun pilot the marine corps and i had i had no desire whatsoever
[05:21:38] to be a pilot none zero i had no desire and you know even like riding into bradley i never liked
[05:21:45] riding into bradley i always felt like i wasn't in control like it was this machine and i couldn't
[05:21:49] really now look i wasn't driving the bradley i was always sitting in the back like you were freaking
[05:21:52] sweat my nuts off and wondering where the hell i was right right no situation so so i'd rather
[05:21:58] be in a higgins boat yeah that you could see where you are yeah that was so so but being a pilot for
[05:22:03] me i never had any desire i'd i'd watch a movie and i didn't care i wanted to see what the grunts
[05:22:09] were doing yeah i always wanted to be on the ground and more specifically i wanted to be
[05:22:13] some kind of a commando of some kind i wanted to like put cammy pain on and sneak over beaches
[05:22:19] and kill people that's what i wanted to do that's the only that's the first job i remember wanting
[05:22:25] like when i've realized i'm gonna grow up and i had to do something i wanted to do that something
[05:22:31] where i put uh uh cammy cork on my face you know because we used to burn the cork and put the black
[05:22:36] on our faces when we were little kids i wanted to do that over the water into enemy territory and
[05:22:41] kill bad guys that's the only thing i remember wanting to do so that's why if i want to join the
[05:22:45] steel teams it would have been the marine corps because the marine corps was in the water and
[05:22:49] i knew that much even as a young kid but pilot was never was never was never into it never
[05:22:57] even thought about it for a minute so i i always wondered that because it what i think about like
[05:23:04] the um even when i watch avatar i'm rooting for the marines and that i know they're the bad guys but
[05:23:10] that i don't like the blue people are the ones that like i like the i always watch the movies for
[05:23:17] the guys that i i can identify not that you know they're evil they're hurting the you know the
[05:23:22] wonderful blue people but i'm just saying i get it i understand that in the navy the guy every time
[05:23:28] we watch a navy seal movie there's a guy comes out of the water and like gets ready to hold the body
[05:23:33] oh yeah is that a real thing no no that's the the move that movie is called active valor
[05:23:39] and yeah that's not real no that's not real they that's like a that movie is like a
[05:23:48] hour and 30 minute music video of the real bullets yeah they uh you know it's a big
[05:23:55] recruiting thing it was a big recruiting thing and they got some guys to play the roles in the
[05:24:00] movie they they hired these guys they hired this production company to make a recruiting video
[05:24:06] and the guys said hey we can make a recruiting video a 30 second or a one minute recruiting video
[05:24:12] or we can make a 90 minute feature film what do you want and then the naval special warfare at the
[05:24:19] time said well we need people uh let's do it and so it was a big recruiting tool and you know and
[05:24:26] the navy benefits from that because because no one basically no one makes it through seal training
[05:24:33] it's a very small number of people that make it through seal training so the navy gets all
[05:24:36] these dudes and it that's one thing that's that's horrible about trying to go in the seal teams
[05:24:44] is that if you don't make it through the seal team if you don't make it through basic seal
[05:24:46] training you're in the navy and if you're the type of personality that wants to be a machine gunner
[05:24:52] you're gonna end up on a ship in a engine room turning wrenches or changing oil or whatever
[05:24:57] and look that's a legit like that's a legit job for some people some people love or turning wrenches
[05:25:03] some people love being at sea on a ship some people love that kind of job that's what they
[05:25:07] should do and they join the navy to go do that which is perfect but if you join because you
[05:25:11] want to be a seal and you don't make it you're gonna end up in that job that you really don't
[05:25:14] want at all see what's nice about marsock or special forces in the army if you don't make it
[05:25:20] through special forces selection cool you're an infantry line yeah you're you're still in an awesome
[05:25:25] spot you can go back later you'll learn more same thing with the marine corps the seal teams is
[05:25:30] rough in that aspect man you don't make it through seal training you're done you're doing a job that
[05:25:35] you most likely don't want to do that's fascinating that's a good point never thought about that so
[05:25:40] be careful of that man be careful that young people out there that's why go in the army
[05:25:45] go in the army become an infantry man you pick your own mls yeah there you go anywhere and you
[05:25:49] could be extra special 11xv awesome man thank you so much thank you appreciate it with that
[05:25:57] David Belavia has left the building
[05:26:04] whoa crazy town crazy town yeah it's honestly if you're listening to this right now get these
[05:26:12] books and read them they're really powerful and there's so much there's like i said during the
[05:26:21] podcast there's entire storylines that are in these books that i don't didn't even come close to
[05:26:25] mentioning today we even get we even get close to that part of the story which is a this story
[05:26:31] runs the whole thread this other story is in there the whole time there's so much going on he does
[05:26:36] such a great job capturing it the house to house book you can tell when you read it that he's a
[05:26:44] couple years off the battlefield but his mind is not off the battlefield yet his mind is in the game
[05:26:49] when you're reading that thing it is very intense it is very raw and and then you get to read remember
[05:27:01] the ramrods which is what almost two decades later well i guess 15 years later 15 years a long time
[05:27:11] in a man's life 15 years a long time and you learn a lot and you see a lot and you go through a
[05:27:17] lot more and you get perspective on stuff so it's a really incredible read both these books so
[05:27:27] check these books out they're awesome there was a couple of things that he mentioned and i was like
[05:27:34] ah i really put into perspective in a crazy where where he where he described a sniper that they found
[05:27:42] and he was attached to like ivy just to stay there the whole time and what he he said there was a hole
[05:27:48] in a table yeah so he just laying laying on the table so he didn't have to go to the bathroom or
[05:27:53] nothing just right there through the hole in the table just staying there for just days and days
[05:27:58] and days to be a sniper that is committed that is committed there's some committed insurgents
[05:28:05] that are ready to die for their cause did you notice he said something super small
[05:28:12] it's kind of a side note but like he uh he goes when he was anticipating maybe the battle of honor
[05:28:21] scenario and someone's like oh there's also a tape out there and then he was like oh there's a tape
[05:28:27] let's show me the tape and then he said what's in the box yeah he said show me what's in the
[05:28:31] box and then he kept kind of talking to me do you know what that's from what's in the box i do know
[05:28:35] what it's from it's from the movie seven right which is interesting because again because he's now
[05:28:42] older yeah first of all he knows he's forgotten things second of all you learn eventually that
[05:28:48] your perception of what's going on in combat isn't the same as what's really going on in combat so
[05:28:55] he now now at this age he knows that like oh there's a video i wonder what i'm you know he's he knows
[05:29:02] he knows what he thinks he did he knows what he thinks he said he also at that age knows that
[05:29:10] what he thinks he said and what he thinks he did may or may not be on there may or may not be perceived
[05:29:18] the same way by everybody else so that's why he's like what's in the box that was to me that was a
[05:29:24] pretty much perfect movie analogy it's very impressed yeah what's in the box he wants to know
[05:29:29] but he don't want to know it seems like it was that kind of deal i liked it yeah so much respect
[05:29:33] for that as well yeah yeah and if you get that you can watch it on parts of it on youtube i didn't
[05:29:39] know that there's he mentioned a 29 minute version so that would be the entire the entire event
[05:29:47] probably from the time they get to the house they go in the house they get everyone out of the house
[05:29:50] they wait for the bradley's brother like that whole thing is probably 29 minutes there's one clip
[05:29:55] that i've watched which is maybe like five minutes long and it's basically from the time they're
[05:29:59] getting to the house the last time when he's gonna go in and kill everybody that's on video on youtube
[05:30:06] that you can go and watch and look it's not like a movie because most of it's just black
[05:30:12] like flashes noises explosions you don't really know what's happening
[05:30:17] you now once you've read the book and now you hear the podcast you're gonna be like okay that
[05:30:23] must be what's oh okay that's what and but then you see you know at the end of it here they are
[05:30:27] dragging these bodies out of this house that this guy went in there and killed and yeah it's
[05:30:36] it's definitely wild and that movie by by where the the movie the only the dead
[05:30:44] it's definitely a fascinating movie to watch and and you get you have to understand his
[05:30:51] perspective a little bit it takes a little getting used to because for me you're watching it like oh
[05:30:57] wait this guy's with musha hadeen forces that are attacking americans like i hate this guy
[05:31:02] but what are you doing you're embedded with like i hate you like why don't you stop them
[05:31:07] and so but then you realize hey he's trying to figure out what's going on and
[05:31:10] and so you end up understanding what he's doing even though at the time
[05:31:16] and there's some i i actually i need to watch it again because there's some that dichotomy is
[05:31:21] brought out in a way that is makes it easier to understand because let's face it if you're freaking
[05:31:26] sitting there while musha hadeen forces are getting ready to kill americans and you're not
[05:31:29] doing something to stop them i got a problem with you you know and i think some of it is like he's
[05:31:34] with them and he's like holy shit they're doing an attack and he kind of just he knows if he says
[05:31:38] anything they'll just kill him um and yeah it's it's a really but then and then at a certain
[05:31:45] point the movie he basically stops embedding with the moose because he realizes that they're evil
[05:31:50] and he starts embedding with the americans but he has got a lot he passes a lot and he passes a
[05:31:55] lot of intel to the americans and especially to like david bella via and his platoon he's given them
[05:32:03] exact intel about who they're fighting and it it's really clear in the book how helpful he was from
[05:32:09] that perspective but who knows maybe uh at some point we can have michael where he's he's got all
[05:32:15] kinds of crazy stories from his all the insane things he's done and it's weird you know like
[05:32:20] i guess the the the highest degree of of explaining all that would be a documentary right but at the
[05:32:33] same time a documentary is only going to be an hour long and you know you got limitations and what
[05:32:38] you can put in there and how long you want to whereas if he's coming explain some of that stuff on
[05:32:41] the podcast and maybe a little bit of a longer format you could get down to some some good
[05:32:46] some good information that may not be conveyed properly in the in the in the hour and a half
[05:32:55] long documentary yeah hey how hard like wait have you ever done judicious you look with full gear on
[05:33:03] like the full gig how is it a lot different like it feels like especially just even how he
[05:33:09] sort of mentioned is seems like dang that might be a lot harder actually no it's it's not it's not
[05:33:16] a lot harder yeah it's not a lot different it's a little harder it's a little different it's not
[05:33:23] a lot of either i feel like then again then this is more of a question like the bottom game would
[05:33:29] feels like it'd be a lot more different than the the top game wouldn't be that much no but they're
[05:33:34] both about the same different oh for real yep yep that was a excuse that got used by people
[05:33:42] when it came to training martial arts and jujitsu in the seal teams it was like well you know jujitsu
[05:33:47] you just wear a gi you don't wear all this gear or jujitsu you just wear a rash guard so it's
[05:33:51] unrealistic and you're not going to be able to fight when you have gear on and which is they would
[05:33:56] say the same thing about you or i would make comparison to parachuting because when you
[05:34:02] parachute with military equipment it's this big parachute and you've got you could potentially
[05:34:07] have a weapon with you potentially have a rucksack with you and you could have protect potentially
[05:34:11] have your web gear with you and you have all these things on so it's a lot different than me running
[05:34:16] down to sanny acedral or wherever and doing a civilian jump where i'm just like literally
[05:34:21] wearing a pair of short sneakers and i jump out a little back a little little uh parachute on my
[05:34:26] back and jump out throw out you know it's just real easy and slick and cool yeah but here's the
[05:34:31] thing if you're really good at those slick cool civilian jumps and you put a military rig on
[05:34:36] you're gonna be really good same thing with shooting sometimes guys would be like well you
[05:34:41] don't want to learn the bad habits of target shooting or of three gun shooting which is a certain
[05:34:47] competition type of shooting you don't want to get the bad habits from that but if you take a guy
[05:34:53] that is a three gun shooter competitive and now he's in combat he's just gonna be infinitely better
[05:34:59] now look are there certain little things you got to watch out for yes there are certain little
[05:35:03] things that you got to watch out for you know i don't know if you've ever heard the story but
[05:35:07] there's a shootout in florida i think it was in florida and the cop when they the cop got killed
[05:35:13] and when they did like the investigation he had the shells from his revolver in his pocket
[05:35:20] which meant that as he was reloading instead of just dumping the shells from his revolver he was
[05:35:27] catching him putting him back in his pocket which is a habit that he got from being on the police
[05:35:31] range and you don't want to have to bend down and pick up your brass so you just put him into
[05:35:34] your hand you put him in your pocket so he had lost whatever three quarters of a second or a
[05:35:40] second and a half on every reload because he had this habit so you do have to pay attention to what
[05:35:47] bad habits you may or may not get from doing these civilian activities that are complementary to your
[05:35:56] military career so for instance there are positions in jujitsu where it may not be the best thing to
[05:36:05] do because oh you got a sidearm right or like let's say your police officer there's certain
[05:36:10] positions you want to use because it doesn't expose your weapon it doesn't expose your weapon to
[05:36:15] being grabbed so you want to do certain things that are a little bit different now would i rather
[05:36:21] be a cop that's a purple belt in jujitsu that might have one bad habit or some cop that has no
[05:36:30] experience in jujitsu is going to get the shit beat out of you you're going to get the shit beat
[05:36:35] out of you that's what's going to happen yeah so so so jujitsu with gear on is slightly different
[05:36:44] slightly harder but very very similar and it's and it's similar enough that it's going to make all
[05:36:51] the difference in the world yeah one of these scenarios and yes and keep in mind even if it was
[05:36:57] like a lot bulkier and a lot harder it's still better than no jujitsu and which i've always
[05:37:03] thought or whatever but i was wondering at the time you know you obviously you know he tells the
[05:37:07] story all good so i'm like thinking about it like how that looked and how that felt or whatever and
[05:37:12] like i kind of imagine like trying to choke someone and you know like you ever like maybe if you have
[05:37:17] the gi on and they're fighting your choke or whatever and maybe they're not even fighting that
[05:37:21] good but it's easier to fight a choke with the gi on versus with no gi right because you can just
[05:37:26] grab any part of that thing or whatever so with the bulky gear on chest plate helmet like all this
[05:37:32] stuff it's like kind of hard i would think it'd be harder so i'm like shoot i wonder how freaking
[05:37:37] hard even if the dude is untrained i wonder how much harder that would be it'd be the same as training
[05:37:43] versus untrained like a jujitsu fighter yeah someone that doesn't know jujitsu is lost yeah and i
[05:37:49] feel like sometimes well a lot of times anyway people don't do jujitsu or maybe they'll do another
[05:37:53] martial art or maybe they'll advocate for another martial art they'll do the straw man thing where
[05:37:57] they'll be like yeah you're gonna pull guard in the street or whatever like i think it's pretty
[05:38:02] common knowledge that someone who knows jujitsu and they get in a fight with a guy on the street
[05:38:06] or in a kill house or whatever they're not going to pull guard on the guy they're gonna
[05:38:09] it's like hey let me basically what they do is they look for the most inappropriate move of
[05:38:15] jujitsu and they say what you're gonna do that that move on the most inappropriate time whatever
[05:38:19] when the the reality is no jujitsu is like a bunch of moves actually infinite moves and you know a
[05:38:26] certain amount of those infinite moves and you're gonna do literally every single time that you
[05:38:30] possibly can the most appropriate move for the appropriate time and pulling guard on the street
[05:38:35] guard is one of the many moves that's more yes geared towards a training scenario like with
[05:38:40] another jujitsu guy or with you know a tournament scenario whatever but that's not like a yeah
[05:38:47] that's not a self defense or a real fighting no unless you know like for for Bella via this
[05:38:54] dude comes out of the closet if he would have just like like hit him and knocked him to the ground
[05:38:59] and all of a sudden David Bella via is on the bottom oh yeah and that's not pulling guard that's
[05:39:02] that's very different but you are on the bottom and you are gonna need to get out from the bottom
[05:39:06] or at least control the guy from killing you you better know guard so you better know guard at that
[05:39:10] point yes so and you know that's exactly what what he said too you know and look you got you got all
[05:39:17] your friends you got a machine gun all your friends got machine guns you got a pistol all your
[05:39:22] friends got pistols you got a knife all your friends got knives you'd think there's a pretty slim
[05:39:27] chance you're gonna have to actually kill someone with your hands or with your helmet or with your
[05:39:33] knife it's pretty small chance but there you go there you go so keep training everybody keep training
[05:39:43] awesome honor to have him on with that speaking of training when you train you're gonna need to
[05:39:49] feel your system it's true it's true jockel few so again i know this common knowledge or whatever
[05:39:56] but this is one of those deals where you know you can get plenty supplements from plenty places
[05:40:00] you know but you want to get the for real clean on the one with only upside no downside yeah that's
[05:40:06] what i had to add it's true so the drinks the energy drinks which have no sugar in them the energy
[05:40:16] drinks which have no chemical preservatives in them this is what everyone else is feeding you
[05:40:22] the stuff that has sugar in it the stuff that has chemical preservatives in it the stuff that has
[05:40:27] chemical flavoring in it we don't have any of that this stuff is literally good for you you can get
[05:40:33] it get milk get the ready to drink milk by the way we had a little uh jockel fuel board meeting
