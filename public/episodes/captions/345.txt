[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 345 with Echo Charles and me,
[00:00:03] Jocko willing.
[00:00:04] Good evening Echo.
[00:00:05] Good evening.
[00:00:06] So just got back from an event at echelon front,
[00:00:10] this event that we call the council.
[00:00:12] And what is we have a small group of about 20 leaders.
[00:00:18] We do it out in a very remote location in Northeast Washington
[00:00:23] state.
[00:00:24] And it's an opportunity to really get in depth with some
[00:00:31] leadership tools with some high level leaders that are running
[00:00:34] in most cases, very large organizations.
[00:00:38] And when I was up there, I just wanted to share some of what I
[00:00:43] talked about while I was there and actually one specific idea
[00:00:49] that I first conceptualized at the council last year, 2021.
[00:00:54] So in 2021, I went up there and essentially what happened was
[00:00:57] it was a pretty interesting dynamic.
[00:00:59] I get up there and we're sitting down.
[00:01:02] It's a small group.
[00:01:02] There's like 15 or 20 people there.
[00:01:05] And Leif was telling a story about us being overseas or us
[00:01:10] going through training.
[00:01:11] And he kind of told a story where I came in at some point
[00:01:14] and made like a leadership decision and boom,
[00:01:17] it helped solve whatever the scenario was.
[00:01:19] And then Andrew Paul was up there.
[00:01:21] And Andrew Paul told a story that was something was going on.
[00:01:24] And then I came in and kind of made some decision.
[00:01:27] And then Leif told another one.
[00:01:28] And so for whatever reason, they both told a couple stories
[00:01:32] each that were illustrating some leadership point.
[00:01:36] And in the stories, it made me look
[00:01:41] like this decisive good leader, which is cool, great.
[00:01:44] But of course, we're all telling stories about each other.
[00:01:47] But a couple of the leaders that were there,
[00:01:50] after this one session, they approached me.
[00:01:54] And they said something along the lines of,
[00:01:56] you just have such great natural leadership instincts.
[00:02:03] And of course, my ego is immediately like, oh, hell, yeah.
[00:02:06] Oh, yeah.
[00:02:06] Yeah, of course.
[00:02:08] And then we had a quick conversation.
[00:02:10] And they just said, oh, it's so cool to hear these stories where
[00:02:13] you have these leadership instincts.
[00:02:15] And I said, yeah, you know, it's pretty cool.
[00:02:17] I'm pretty cool.
[00:02:17] You know, all kind of that ego, idiocy.
[00:02:22] And then as I thought about it, and we were on a break,
[00:02:27] and as I thought about it, there was actually a break
[00:02:30] at the end of the day.
[00:02:30] As I thought about it, I thought, well, that's actually
[00:02:33] not cool at all.
[00:02:35] Because if my leadership is just some natural instinct,
[00:02:40] then that implies that it's something
[00:02:43] that I can't teach you.
[00:02:44] I can't teach you.
[00:02:45] I can't teach you something that is only instinctive.
[00:02:50] So as I thought about it, I also realized not only is that bad,
[00:02:56] but I also realized that there was plenty of times in my life
[00:02:59] where, especially when I was younger,
[00:03:02] and I didn't have much experience as a leader,
[00:03:04] where I didn't make good decisions,
[00:03:07] or I didn't even realize I needed to make a decision.
[00:03:10] And so as I'm sitting there thinking about this during
[00:03:12] this break, I realized that I had learned to lead,
[00:03:18] and I developed knowledge and developed
[00:03:21] kind of a process that was so embedded in my brain
[00:03:23] that it seemed like instinct.
[00:03:25] And when these guys hear the story, it seems like instinct.
[00:03:28] But it's not instinct.
[00:03:29] It's more of a process.
[00:03:32] And so I sat in my room, and I went through and just sort of
[00:03:38] wrote down the process that I used, the things that I think
[00:03:41] about when I'm making a decision.
[00:03:45] And since then, I've implemented that and teach it
[00:03:48] at Eshalon Front.
[00:03:49] And I've added a couple things to it since that time frame.
[00:03:54] And basically call it the extreme ownership leadership loop.
[00:03:59] And the reason is because extreme ownership, the book
[00:04:01] that Leif and I wrote, that term just kind of encompasses
[00:04:05] the broad principles that we try and operate by.
[00:04:11] And there's a reason that I use the term loop.
[00:04:13] The reason I use the term loop is clearly taken from the OOTA
[00:04:16] loop, Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act.
[00:04:21] And when you are making a decision,
[00:04:25] you can utilize that loop, Observe, Orient, Decide,
[00:04:30] and Act and what that means is, a real quick brief on that.
[00:04:33] First of all, you observe, means you look around
[00:04:35] and see what's happening.
[00:04:36] Then you orient, you see where you are in what you have
[00:04:41] observed, then you decide what you should do,
[00:04:44] and then you act on it.
[00:04:45] And once you've acted, you go back to looking around
[00:04:48] and see how your actions impacted what's happening.
[00:04:51] And then you orient yourself inside this new picture,
[00:04:54] and then you decide what you should do now, and then you
[00:04:55] act again, and you just keep running this loop.
[00:04:58] And every time you take an action,
[00:05:02] it's going to change the situation a little bit.
[00:05:06] And then you have to observe that feedback,
[00:05:08] orient yourself with that new feedback,
[00:05:10] and then you make another decision.
[00:05:12] And this becomes a little loop that you run over and over
[00:05:15] again, and it comes from flying jets in combat and dogfights.
[00:05:21] And it's a way that you win.
[00:05:22] And the way that you win is by making decisions and observing
[00:05:28] and orient yourself, deciding what you can do,
[00:05:30] and acting faster than the other person can do it.
[00:05:32] And if you can do that, you'll win.
[00:05:33] And this also applies in Jiu-Jitsu, obviously.
[00:05:37] So that's a loop that you need to run when
[00:05:42] it comes to making decisions.
[00:05:43] And this is a similar process to apply in this leadership
[00:05:50] decision loop that I think through when
[00:05:56] I'm trying to make a decision.
[00:05:58] And again, a lot of times it seems like it's just
[00:06:00] some instinct.
[00:06:02] But there's a thought process behind it.
[00:06:04] And listen, the Uda loop, for the most part, the Uda loop,
[00:06:09] I view it as more of a tactical decision
[00:06:14] in a physical realm against an enemy or a competitor.
[00:06:22] It's sort of an interaction between you and someone else
[00:06:27] in a physical, usually in a physical domain,
[00:06:31] whether it's fighter, whether it's
[00:06:32] tactical maneuver on the battlefield.
[00:06:34] That's why it's so applicable to combat.
[00:06:37] Because in combat, you're going against another person.
[00:06:40] So as you decide and act, that's going to cause a reaction
[00:06:45] that you have to then calculate into your new observations,
[00:06:49] into your new orientation.
[00:06:51] And so the Uda loop really is about,
[00:06:54] it takes place in the physical realm, for the most part.
[00:06:59] This loop that I'm talking about, this EO, this extreme
[00:07:03] ownership, leadership loop, it's usually,
[00:07:07] I shouldn't say usually not about physical decisions,
[00:07:09] but it's equally applicable to conceptual ideas
[00:07:17] or conceptual plans.
[00:07:19] Or, and this is important, about human interaction
[00:07:23] that's not physical.
[00:07:26] It's more the conflict of ideas.
[00:07:30] So one loop is, in my mind, more of something
[00:07:34] that takes place in the physical realm.
[00:07:36] This EO leadership loop takes place more
[00:07:39] in the conceptual realm.
[00:07:41] Does that make sense?
[00:07:42] Yeah, fully.
[00:07:42] Like in a social, verbal, all that.
[00:07:46] Right.
[00:07:49] And what this loop does is it provides a checklist
[00:07:55] or a framework of things to consider while making a decision.
[00:07:59] And listen, when you first hear this,
[00:08:01] there's a bunch of things to think about.
[00:08:04] And what's weird is I had been doing this for so long
[00:08:07] that it seemed to other people, and really to me, as instinct.
[00:08:12] And it wasn't until I said, wait a second,
[00:08:14] is this really instinct, or is this
[00:08:15] something I learned?
[00:08:16] Well, I know I used to not have it.
[00:08:17] Therefore, it can't be instinct.
[00:08:18] I must have learned it.
[00:08:19] What exactly am I thinking?
[00:08:20] What am I considering when I'm out there trying
[00:08:23] to make a decision in a leadership situation?
[00:08:27] So let's talk through some of these things.
[00:08:29] And there's a whole bunch of dynamics going on here.
[00:08:32] And I don't want to simplify this to a point where you go, oh,
[00:08:36] this is just a checklist.
[00:08:37] Here's the 19 or 14 or whatever number of things.
[00:08:40] And you just follow this checklist,
[00:08:42] because each one of these things is a conceptual item.
[00:08:47] There's a big difference between a conceptual idea
[00:08:49] and a physical thing.
[00:08:51] Because the physical thing is in this position.
[00:08:54] It has this mass.
[00:08:55] It has this weight.
[00:08:56] It takes up this place in the world.
[00:09:02] An idea, a concept, a plan, by its very nature is fluid.
[00:09:09] So all these things, for the most part, are somewhat fluid.
[00:09:15] Now, there's something about the first thing
[00:09:17] that I think about when I'm making some kind of a decision
[00:09:19] that's actually not fluid at all.
[00:09:20] And that's why it's number one.
[00:09:24] And that is time.
[00:09:26] That's the number one thing I think about.
[00:09:27] The first thing that I consider when I'm making decision
[00:09:29] is time.
[00:09:31] And the reason is, because this is the one thing that's not
[00:09:33] fluid, it is what it is.
[00:09:36] It is what it is.
[00:09:37] And you can't stop it.
[00:09:39] Can't stop it.
[00:09:40] You know what I'm talking to?
[00:09:42] Kerry Helton?
[00:09:43] Sure.
[00:09:43] You know him?
[00:09:44] K-Dog.
[00:09:44] K-Dog.
[00:09:45] That's right.
[00:09:46] He was talking about Marine Corps Boot Camp.
[00:09:48] And he had a good little hint for anybody that's
[00:09:52] going through something tough.
[00:09:54] And the thing that he thought about
[00:09:56] was these drill instructors, they
[00:10:01] might be all powerful in Marine Corps Boot Camp.
[00:10:03] They are all powerful, near-Godlike figures.
[00:10:07] But guess what?
[00:10:08] They can't stop the clock.
[00:10:11] And no one can stop the clock.
[00:10:13] And I, you, us, we, we have no influence over time.
[00:10:20] We do have influence over actions clearly,
[00:10:23] but we don't have influence over time.
[00:10:25] That clock is going to keep going.
[00:10:28] Look, you can, you can, you can get ahead of it
[00:10:33] by working hard, by thinking ahead.
[00:10:35] And that's why it's the first thing that I think about.
[00:10:38] But you can't stop it, no matter what.
[00:10:41] That's why I can't stand being late.
[00:10:44] That's why when going to the airport,
[00:10:49] I'm going to show up early.
[00:10:50] I look not crazy early, but I'm going to show up early enough
[00:10:53] that nothing is going to make me panic.
[00:10:55] Nothing is going to make me agitated.
[00:10:58] The TSA dude's taking his time.
[00:10:59] Cool, I got time.
[00:11:01] And you ever notice when you're late for something,
[00:11:04] everything goes against you?
[00:11:05] Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:06] Right?
[00:11:06] Feels like it.
[00:11:07] It's true.
[00:11:08] If you're, if you're on time, green lights.
[00:11:11] Yeah.
[00:11:12] If you're late, red lights.
[00:11:13] Red lights all day.
[00:11:14] Not only that, but weird red lights.
[00:11:17] Right?
[00:11:17] Anomalous red lights.
[00:11:19] How long is a red light when you're late?
[00:11:21] That thing is forever.
[00:11:22] Yeah, it's true.
[00:11:23] But the weird thing is, it's the same.
[00:11:25] It's just that you're different.
[00:11:26] Your mentality is different.
[00:11:30] I tell you that story about the other day,
[00:11:32] speaking of like mentality.
[00:11:34] So I was at REI.
[00:11:37] You from the other REI?
[00:11:38] The store?
[00:11:38] Yeah.
[00:11:39] Yeah, yeah, yeah, sports store.
[00:11:40] It's good.
[00:11:41] So I'm in REI.
[00:11:42] And I got a sprinter.
[00:11:44] Sure.
[00:11:45] Vehicle.
[00:11:45] It's a good vehicle for sure.
[00:11:46] Four-wheel drive sprinter.
[00:11:48] No big deal.
[00:11:48] And I get it.
[00:11:49] OK, so do you know that sprinters are a thing?
[00:11:52] Do you know that?
[00:11:53] I know that now, yes.
[00:11:54] Yeah.
[00:11:54] They're a thing.
[00:11:55] My wife told me that when she saw yours.
[00:11:57] Yep.
[00:11:57] And not only are they a thing, there's
[00:12:01] also a big negative perception of them,
[00:12:05] because they're expensive and people drive them around.
[00:12:11] And they're into people that might have sprinters,
[00:12:16] might be into sort of outdoors type sports
[00:12:22] and a lot of times people that are in outdoors type sports
[00:12:25] don't have a ton of money.
[00:12:27] Oh, got you.
[00:12:27] So hey, look at rock climbing.
[00:12:29] Right?
[00:12:30] Rock climbing, camp for Yosemite.
[00:12:32] Their actual name for themselves is dirtbags.
[00:12:35] Hey, we don't have money.
[00:12:37] We live in a little freaking Toyota Corolla.
[00:12:39] We sleep in a tent.
[00:12:41] Like, that's what they're doing.
[00:12:42] So you get those kind of people.
[00:12:43] You get surf bums.
[00:12:45] Right?
[00:12:45] You and I have talked about the fact that bums is a lifestyle
[00:12:49] and there's a bunch of them.
[00:12:50] Surf bums, jujitsu bums, rock climbing bums, ski bums.
[00:12:54] So there's a bunch of bums, right?
[00:12:56] Well, all of those lifestyles can also
[00:12:58] include people that might drive sprinters.
[00:13:00] The bougie of the group.
[00:13:02] The bougie people, right?
[00:13:04] So I'm a bougie person, I guess, because I got a sprinter.
[00:13:08] And guess what?
[00:13:09] I like to surf.
[00:13:10] I like to ski.
[00:13:11] I go to Yosemite, right?
[00:13:12] So I do those things.
[00:13:15] So I'm at Ariai to pick up a bicycle.
[00:13:18] Sure.
[00:13:19] And as I'm pulling out, I'm leaving.
[00:13:23] And by the way, I'm in no rush whatsoever.
[00:13:25] Time is on my side.
[00:13:27] I'm listening to an audiobook.
[00:13:30] I'm totally chill.
[00:13:31] I don't have to be.
[00:13:33] I think we weren't recording that day.
[00:13:36] I had done like a couple calls in the morning for echelon
[00:13:38] front.
[00:13:39] I was in no rush.
[00:13:41] Just kind of enjoying.
[00:13:42] Like, I was working in the morning.
[00:13:43] And it was like a nice little mini vacation, to be honest.
[00:13:47] We drive to Ariai.
[00:13:47] You know, go to Ariai, you get up there,
[00:13:49] you get to look around, see some cool gear.
[00:13:51] It's nice, yeah.
[00:13:52] So that's my mindset.
[00:13:55] Just cruising to any.
[00:13:55] By the way, it's midday.
[00:13:57] This isn't a weekend.
[00:13:58] This is like on a Tuesday or something.
[00:14:00] There's no panic at all.
[00:14:02] No one's even in there.
[00:14:03] It's like after, I'll tell you how clear this was,
[00:14:07] it's after the lunchtime rush on Tuesday.
[00:14:11] Complete chill.
[00:14:12] So as I'm pulling out, I won't try and explain the whole thing,
[00:14:16] but there's like a three-way intersection in the parking
[00:14:20] lot.
[00:14:22] And so I back out my sprinter.
[00:14:25] And there's another truck that I'm now head to head with.
[00:14:28] He wants to go right to get out.
[00:14:30] I want to go left to get out.
[00:14:32] And in comes a little Volkswagen van again, Syncro.
[00:14:40] So what this is, this is a four-wheel drive Volkswagen van.
[00:14:47] Very rare, very cool.
[00:14:50] Like one of the coolest, it's a very,
[00:14:51] I won't say it's one of the coolest vehicles in the world,
[00:14:53] but it's definitely in my top.
[00:14:56] That's a cool vehicle.
[00:14:57] They're super rare.
[00:14:58] So Syncro, that's a four-wheel drive van.
[00:15:03] Oh yeah, for a little Volkswagen van.
[00:15:04] Yeah, I love vans.
[00:15:05] So which is why I have a sprinter.
[00:15:07] Yes, sir.
[00:15:08] So I see this van and I'm kind of like, oh, dude, that's a sick.
[00:15:12] Four-wheel drive Syncro van.
[00:15:14] It's super rare.
[00:15:15] They're hard to get.
[00:15:18] And the truck wants to go right.
[00:15:22] He goes right.
[00:15:23] I'm like, cool.
[00:15:24] That guy's being cool.
[00:15:25] Or I give him the little hand wave.
[00:15:27] He goes, because I'm super chill.
[00:15:29] By the way, I'm looking at this cool Syncro.
[00:15:31] So I give the guy a hand wave and the truck, I'm like, hey, man,
[00:15:33] go ahead.
[00:15:33] So he pulls out.
[00:15:35] And then I think that the Syncro wants to make a right.
[00:15:39] So I look at him.
[00:15:41] I give him the hand wave.
[00:15:42] Just like, hey, man, come on.
[00:15:44] And I was, you know, the next hand signal
[00:15:47] would have been thumbs up.
[00:15:48] I might have even, I may have even rolled down the window
[00:15:51] and said, sweet ride.
[00:15:54] That's a sweet ride, man.
[00:15:56] Respect, props.
[00:15:59] I give him the hand signal.
[00:16:00] Like, yeah, go ahead, man.
[00:16:01] You can make the right turn and then I'll get out after you.
[00:16:04] You get ahead of the line privileges.
[00:16:07] You go first.
[00:16:09] And guess what he does?
[00:16:10] He starts freaking, you know, of course,
[00:16:12] behind a windscreen.
[00:16:13] I can't hear what he's saying.
[00:16:14] He starts going crazy on me.
[00:16:17] Like, he's yelling.
[00:16:19] And what he was basically saying was he wanted me to move,
[00:16:23] because the parking space I had just pulled out of,
[00:16:25] he had pulled into.
[00:16:26] And by the way, there was multiple parking spaces.
[00:16:29] There was no factor.
[00:16:30] But man, he was mad.
[00:16:32] And he was like getting all hostile and like doing this
[00:16:35] to me.
[00:16:35] And I was just like, and of course, what I did,
[00:16:36] smiled at him and waved at him anyways.
[00:16:38] I didn't give him props for his synchro.
[00:16:40] So if you're listening, nice synchro, bro.
[00:16:42] And I hope your synchro and the fact
[00:16:45] that you have a cool vehicle like that,
[00:16:46] I hope that it soothes your soul a little bit.
[00:16:49] Because he is an older dude, too.
[00:16:52] He was at least my age.
[00:16:54] He wasn't a spring chicken.
[00:16:55] And there's no reason for him to be stressed out on a Tuesday
[00:16:58] at 1,300 or 1,330 in the afternoon at REI.
[00:17:01] No reason, man.
[00:17:02] No reason.
[00:17:04] So in his mind, whatever was happening for the time factor
[00:17:08] was a problem.
[00:17:08] For me, it was no factor.
[00:17:10] But you can't get that stuff back.
[00:17:12] You can't adjust time.
[00:17:14] So we have to stay ahead of time.
[00:17:17] So when I'm making a decision, the first thing
[00:17:20] that I'm going to assess is how much time do I have?
[00:17:23] Here's another thing.
[00:17:25] How fast are things changing?
[00:17:28] That's a time factor.
[00:17:29] You have to look at, OK, I see things
[00:17:31] are changing, but how fast are they changing?
[00:17:32] Because if they're changing rapidly,
[00:17:34] I might have to decide quicker.
[00:17:36] If they're changing slowly, maybe I
[00:17:38] can take a little bit more time.
[00:17:41] Are there things that I can do to buy myself more time?
[00:17:45] I know I said we can't control time,
[00:17:47] but you can't do things that can earn you some time back.
[00:17:51] Maybe there's an iterative step that I
[00:17:53] can take that will slow things down a little bit on my side.
[00:17:57] Again, I can't stop the clock, but I can slow them down.
[00:18:01] So that's what I'm going to do.
[00:18:04] I don't have any control over time,
[00:18:06] and I'm going to think about that.
[00:18:08] I'm going to consider it.
[00:18:10] The number one element in my calculus is time.
[00:18:13] And here's something else that I realize.
[00:18:18] Some human beings have a better sense of time than others.
[00:18:21] This is just a thing.
[00:18:23] Some human beings are more aware of time than others.
[00:18:28] There are people that are late habitually.
[00:18:30] Right?
[00:18:31] Do we know this?
[00:18:32] We do know.
[00:18:32] Actually, somebody at the council asked me,
[00:18:34] hey, how do you do with echo being late all the time?
[00:18:36] And I had to give them the information that you're actually
[00:18:38] not.
[00:18:39] I think you've only been literally late once or twice
[00:18:43] for recording the podcast.
[00:18:45] Yeah, it's once or twice.
[00:18:47] Now, do you cut it down to literally 32 seconds?
[00:18:52] And actually, if we included when you are maybe like 45
[00:18:55] seconds late, we might have to add to that number.
[00:18:57] But there's no time.
[00:18:59] There's a very small number of actual violations.
[00:19:02] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:19:03] I think so.
[00:19:04] But there are some people that are late all the time.
[00:19:08] There are people that think that things are going to take
[00:19:11] five minutes, and they take 20, and that's how they see time.
[00:19:15] And so they're late all the time.
[00:19:17] So if you're one of those people,
[00:19:18] and this is going to be a constant theme,
[00:19:20] if you're one of those people and you know that you don't
[00:19:23] understand time and you don't pay attention to time,
[00:19:27] the worst you are with time, if you're
[00:19:29] a person that's habitually late, this should not only be the
[00:19:32] number one thing in your decision making,
[00:19:34] it should be number one, and it should be printed in bold,
[00:19:38] large font so that you make sure that you get it.
[00:19:43] Now, listen, I'm actually good with time.
[00:19:47] In fact, sometimes I'm even too good with time,
[00:19:49] and I'll tell you exactly what I mean by that.
[00:19:51] Sometimes, if I think, let's say,
[00:19:56] we were going to record the podcast at 10 o'clock,
[00:19:59] and I was like, OK, in order to record the podcast at 10 o'clock,
[00:20:04] I got to leave at 9.30.
[00:20:06] That gives me a half an hour to get here.
[00:20:07] It only takes 15 minutes to get here.
[00:20:09] Tops, unless something wild happens,
[00:20:14] or I hit every single red light or something.
[00:20:17] So I might be like, oh, I need to take out the garbage right now.
[00:20:21] But that's going to take me an extra two minutes,
[00:20:24] and there's a 0.0001% chance that I hit every red light.
[00:20:30] And now that two minutes that it took me to take out the garbage,
[00:20:33] now I'm late.
[00:20:34] So I didn't take out the garbage.
[00:20:36] So sometimes I have to consciously say, yes, I can fit this in.
[00:20:40] Yes, I can get that done.
[00:20:41] And that is a good thing to do.
[00:20:43] But I'm almost never late.
[00:20:49] I would say never, but of course, I'm sure there's
[00:20:51] been some time in the last 50 years where I was late
[00:20:54] for something, but I'm almost never late.
[00:20:57] And probably, and what I think is,
[00:21:01] that's because of this loop that I run in my head.
[00:21:04] I always think about time first.
[00:21:06] And that.
[00:21:07] So the reason I'm never late is because I
[00:21:08] think about this all the time.
[00:21:11] So know yourself.
[00:21:13] And if you're a person that constantly
[00:21:15] underestimates how much time it'll take to do something,
[00:21:18] know yourself.
[00:21:20] Understand your own bias.
[00:21:21] And this is actually one of the things
[00:21:22] that the loop is understanding your own biases.
[00:21:24] This is where you've got to run that and make sure
[00:21:26] that you're going to have enough time to do something.
[00:21:29] Check.
[00:21:30] Yeah, fully.
[00:21:31] And regardless of my record of not being late very much,
[00:21:36] here I am one of those people that underestimate.
[00:21:40] How did you put it?
[00:21:41] Underestimate how much time I have?
[00:21:43] How much time?
[00:21:43] Overestimate.
[00:21:44] Overestimate how much time you have.
[00:21:46] Underestimate how much time something is going to take.
[00:21:48] Yes.
[00:21:49] Interestingly, if we were to talk about how often
[00:21:52] you were late for jujitsu, that's a big number.
[00:21:54] Yeah.
[00:21:55] That's a big number.
[00:21:56] The majority, yeah.
[00:21:58] It was weird.
[00:21:59] Actually, in the beginning, when I was coming up,
[00:22:02] I was never late.
[00:22:02] But I think you're the one who said this to me kind of bluntly
[00:22:07] a long time ago, where you said something like,
[00:22:10] oh, it's because you don't think it's important or something
[00:22:12] like this.
[00:22:13] But I realized it's true, even though most of the time I
[00:22:17] wouldn't admit that to the person that I'm late with
[00:22:20] or whatever the entity or whatever.
[00:22:22] When I worked in the nightclub, I was late most of the time.
[00:22:25] And I'm not saying like, I was supposed to be there at 6
[00:22:29] and I was there at like 6.30.
[00:22:31] It wasn't that.
[00:22:31] It was the kind of 6.01, 6.03.
[00:22:33] How about 6.08?
[00:22:35] 6.08 from the time.
[00:22:36] As you get up past five minutes late, it was less.
[00:22:39] But it not being important, that was literally the case.
[00:22:44] And not to say my job wasn't important,
[00:22:46] I'm not saying that.
[00:22:47] I'm saying the fact of me being ahead of time
[00:22:50] or before 6 o'clock, that wasn't important to me.
[00:22:53] If I was one, two, three, four, five minutes late,
[00:22:55] that was fine with me for this reason now that I analyze it.
[00:22:59] Because I could be doing more important things
[00:23:03] than in that five minutes, or in that one minute,
[00:23:07] or in that two minutes.
[00:23:08] Kind of a thing, kind of a thought ahead of my head.
[00:23:10] And now, more important things, taking a nap,
[00:23:16] you know, and watching stuff that, the way I saw it was,
[00:23:21] and this is me totally analyzing it mentally.
[00:23:25] This wasn't in my mind the whole time.
[00:23:26] Like, oh yeah, this TV show is way more important than me.
[00:23:30] It wasn't like that.
[00:23:31] It was just as it turns out that, like, dang,
[00:23:35] why would I essentially go to where
[00:23:39] I have to be kind of a thing when I want to do this?
[00:23:43] And I don't have to be there.
[00:23:44] I don't have to be there at 6.59 or 5.59.
[00:23:48] One of my seal buddies, when I was going to college,
[00:23:52] there was another seal that was going to college as well.
[00:23:56] And we actually made a deal.
[00:23:59] Because in order to be on time for something,
[00:24:03] because of parking at this particular college,
[00:24:05] and eventually I figured out that I would just throw my bike
[00:24:08] in the back of my van and just whip the bike out
[00:24:11] and bike to the class.
[00:24:12] Park away away from campus and just jump on my bike
[00:24:16] and drive or ride the bike.
[00:24:18] But when we would be studying together,
[00:24:21] and we'd be like, hey, we'll study it.
[00:24:23] I'll meet you at 9 o'clock to study.
[00:24:26] We did this a few times.
[00:24:27] And then eventually, and he was like a guy like me married
[00:24:30] with kids.
[00:24:30] So we didn't want to, if we didn't have to be at campus,
[00:24:35] we didn't want to be there.
[00:24:36] Not to mention Jiu Jitsu, not to mention surfing.
[00:24:39] So there's a bunch of other things we'd all rather be doing.
[00:24:41] So we made a deal.
[00:24:42] I was like, hey, I'll see you around 9.
[00:24:47] And he was like, yeah, because that way, if you rolled up
[00:24:50] and you took you an extra four minutes to find parking,
[00:24:53] you weren't like, dude.
[00:24:54] Because the only way to ensure you weren't going
[00:24:56] to be four minutes late was to be a half an hour early.
[00:25:00] You see what I'm saying?
[00:25:01] The only way to, it cost you 26 minutes of life
[00:25:06] in order to ensure that you weren't going
[00:25:08] to be four minutes late.
[00:25:09] And so we were like, hey, listen, around 9.
[00:25:12] And we actually had the conversation,
[00:25:14] because both of us squared away like, hey, being late
[00:25:17] is the worst thing in the world.
[00:25:18] And we made an agreement, a gentleman's agreement,
[00:25:21] that in this particular scenario, you had slack.
[00:25:26] You had slack.
[00:25:27] Yes, I'm great.
[00:25:28] And when you got there, you got there.
[00:25:29] It wasn't going to be 20 minutes late.
[00:25:31] But it was going to be four minutes.
[00:25:32] It might be six minutes.
[00:25:33] It might be three minutes.
[00:25:34] So we had that little gentleman's agreement.
[00:25:36] So the target is nine.
[00:25:39] Target is nine.
[00:25:40] And I'll be there.
[00:25:42] And if you're not there, I know 100% why.
[00:25:44] It's because you weren't going to leave 26 minutes earlier
[00:25:48] to be there on time.
[00:25:49] Because it didn't make sense, because I'd rather
[00:25:50] he was with his kids, or he was surfing,
[00:25:52] or he was doing jujitsu.
[00:25:53] Actually, he did jujitsu.
[00:25:55] I knew he was doing something that was more important
[00:25:57] than sitting and waiting for me to show up
[00:25:59] to prove that we could both be on time.
[00:26:01] Yeah.
[00:26:02] So that's interesting how you say it.
[00:26:04] Or that's an interesting concept, because that's essentially
[00:26:07] the agreement I made with my work.
[00:26:10] They didn't make that agreement.
[00:26:11] But I did, too, where it's like, hey, I'm not going to give up.
[00:26:14] Because it was the same kind of scenario, where
[00:26:15] you have to look for parking.
[00:26:17] Sure, you could pay for parking, but not what.
[00:26:18] I got to pay extra to be at work kind of a thing.
[00:26:20] And I'm not saying that's good, but I'm not
[00:26:22] saying that that should be the case or shouldn't be the case.
[00:26:24] I'm just saying that's what I thought at the time.
[00:26:26] That was the agreement in Echo's head.
[00:26:27] Yes, exactly.
[00:26:29] So downtown San Diego, 6 o'clock PM,
[00:26:33] especially on those Thursday, Friday, Saturday scenarios,
[00:26:36] that's hard to find parking.
[00:26:37] Or it can be, anyway.
[00:26:39] So yeah, so I'd be like, OK, I'm going to go out to my opportune
[00:26:43] time, my best time in my mind.
[00:26:45] And hey, if I'm struggling finding parking,
[00:26:48] I'm struggling finding parking.
[00:26:49] In your mind, it was no factor.
[00:26:51] The gentleman's agreement.
[00:26:52] Because you would have had to leave legitimately, probably
[00:26:55] a half an hour early, to ensure 100% that you were going to be
[00:26:57] on time.
[00:26:58] Yeah, probably a little bit more exactly right.
[00:27:00] To ensure, like, the kind, no, you got to be here before 6
[00:27:04] or whatever kind of a thing, to ensure, yeah, it's like half
[00:27:06] an hour.
[00:27:06] It's like, bro, it's not even, in my mind, it's not even fair.
[00:27:09] How about this?
[00:27:09] How about this?
[00:27:11] Well, we'll decide a reasonable amount of time
[00:27:15] I have to leave the house.
[00:27:16] How about that?
[00:27:17] And if parking is abnormally scarce, or traffic,
[00:27:21] we're going to pay that price together.
[00:27:22] How about that?
[00:27:23] The traffic thing is weird, too, because that's an excuse
[00:27:28] that people use.
[00:27:28] Like, oh, yeah, I really hit traffic.
[00:27:30] And if you live in California, you're like, bro,
[00:27:35] you got to calculate for that.
[00:27:37] Come on.
[00:27:37] Yeah, I agree.
[00:27:39] It's kind of not a valid excuse, unless, let's say you
[00:27:43] and I work in an office every single day.
[00:27:46] And we make that agreement.
[00:27:49] Like, hey, our goal is 9 o'clock, but I understand.
[00:27:52] I don't want you to leave an hour early to make sure you
[00:27:56] get here at that time.
[00:27:58] And I go, hey, man, you leave your house.
[00:28:00] Like you said, you leave your house before this time?
[00:28:02] Reasonable.
[00:28:03] I knew that there's going to be some variables.
[00:28:06] Yeah.
[00:28:07] And especially if they're like, the variables really vary.
[00:28:10] Because the traffic thing, I don't know about your routes
[00:28:14] in San Diego, whatever, but as far as the routine goes,
[00:28:16] very lucid routine that I have, it's
[00:28:19] I know when the traffic is going to be.
[00:28:20] It's pretty predictable.
[00:28:22] You got your anomalous accident or some hold up on the road
[00:28:26] every once in a great, great, great while.
[00:28:28] But so it is, to me anyway, I think
[00:28:33] that factoring the traffic is a fair thing.
[00:28:35] Like you got to, hey, if it takes 15 more minutes
[00:28:38] on this Tuesday after work versus Sunday morning
[00:28:42] or whatever, then that's part of the agreement.
[00:28:45] You got to factor that in.
[00:28:46] Put that in calculus.
[00:28:47] But Sunday morning, let's say Sunday morning,
[00:28:51] every time we're recording and then or whatever we're doing
[00:28:54] and then no traffic.
[00:28:56] And then one day there's like traffic
[00:28:58] because there's some event at the beach or something.
[00:29:02] I do expect a little bit of what do you call it?
[00:29:04] Lieway.
[00:29:05] Lieway.
[00:29:05] OK.
[00:29:07] Kind of.
[00:29:07] We'll see about that.
[00:29:08] So that is time.
[00:29:11] First thing you got to be thinking about causes stress.
[00:29:15] Get ahead of it.
[00:29:18] The next thing, and this should really come as no surprise,
[00:29:20] the next things that I think about are the four laws
[00:29:24] of combat leadership, cover move, simple prioritizing,
[00:29:26] execute, and decentralized command.
[00:29:28] But I think about them in a very particular way.
[00:29:32] So if I'm making a decision, the first thing
[00:29:34] I'm going to think about is cover move.
[00:29:35] The number one thing is, am I supporting my teammates?
[00:29:41] Does this help the team?
[00:29:43] Am I putting my team first?
[00:29:48] So I want you to think about that.
[00:29:49] The first thing I think about is time,
[00:29:50] because I have no control about it.
[00:29:51] The second thing I do is make sure
[00:29:53] that I am not putting myself ahead of the team
[00:29:56] and I'm not making a decision that's
[00:29:57] going to leave anyone else on the team in the lurch.
[00:30:02] And this will immediately vector you in the correct direction.
[00:30:08] Because anytime that you, as a human, are making a decision
[00:30:13] and it's based on benefiting you, there's
[00:30:15] a really good chance that that's a bad call.
[00:30:17] And from a leadership perspective,
[00:30:19] there is a huge chance.
[00:30:21] As a matter of fact, I'm going to go ahead and say,
[00:30:23] that's a bad call.
[00:30:26] The military term is supporting distance.
[00:30:33] So echo, if I'm working with you, if my fire team or my squad
[00:30:38] or my platoon is supporting your fire team, your squad,
[00:30:41] your platoon, I have to stay within a distance where
[00:30:44] I am able to support you.
[00:30:46] That means usually my weapons can cover
[00:30:51] where you may be attacked from.
[00:30:54] And my communications can speak to you directly.
[00:30:58] And generally speaking, in an infantry scenario,
[00:31:02] I want to be where I can actually see you.
[00:31:06] I can actually put on my night vision or at least pull out
[00:31:11] my binoculars and see where you are.
[00:31:13] I got him.
[00:31:13] I know exactly where he is.
[00:31:15] The minute that we're out of that supporting distance,
[00:31:18] there's going to be a problem.
[00:31:20] So from a tactical perspective, that's
[00:31:22] a great thing to think about.
[00:31:24] But from a leadership perspective,
[00:31:27] cover and move is am I being supportive of the rest of my team?
[00:31:35] And if you're not, it's going to be a problem.
[00:31:39] Now, here's a couple of things to watch out for.
[00:31:41] Some people have a tendency to look out for themselves.
[00:31:43] And some people, if they have that tendency,
[00:31:49] one of the worst things about that tendency is they don't
[00:31:53] think anyone else can see it.
[00:31:56] And I'm telling you right now, when people are getting screwed,
[00:32:00] they see it.
[00:32:01] And in whatever subtle way, whatever maneuver you're doing
[00:32:05] that you think no one else can see that you're leaving people,
[00:32:09] everyone can see it.
[00:32:10] They can see it.
[00:32:11] 1,000%, they can see what's going on.
[00:32:14] So if you think you might be a person,
[00:32:18] and this goes back to what are your own personal biases,
[00:32:22] if you are a person that goes through life that kind of looks
[00:32:25] out for yourself, this is where you
[00:32:28] need to index in the right direction appropriately
[00:32:32] to make up the fact that you're a little bit of a person that
[00:32:34] takes care of yourself.
[00:32:36] So just watch out for that.
[00:32:38] And the way you watch out for that
[00:32:40] is by when you're making a decision,
[00:32:42] this is the second thing you ask yourself.
[00:32:45] Am I making this decision, and it's
[00:32:47] only going to benefit me?
[00:32:48] And more important, am I supporting my teammates
[00:32:52] with this decision that I'm going to make?
[00:32:54] And if you're not, reconsider.
[00:32:58] The next one is keeping things simple.
[00:33:03] How complicated is this decision?
[00:33:06] Or how much complexity will this decision add to our situation?
[00:33:13] And that's really a great way to think about it.
[00:33:16] Will this decision take our current situation
[00:33:19] and simplify it?
[00:33:20] If it's going to do that, that's very, very helpful.
[00:33:23] If this decision is going to make things more complex,
[00:33:28] this is usually not a good decision.
[00:33:32] So the minute you say, oh, we just
[00:33:33] need to get some more people down here into the mix,
[00:33:36] and all of a sudden you think to yourself, wait a second,
[00:33:39] that's actually going to make things more complicated.
[00:33:42] Reconsider.
[00:33:43] Again, you can still, hey, any one of these things
[00:33:46] that I'm saying right now, there are situations where you have
[00:33:50] to still push through it.
[00:33:52] It's when you're not thinking about it.
[00:33:54] When you're not being intentional about your decision,
[00:33:56] that's when you're going to have a problem.
[00:33:57] Most important, when you don't even recognize,
[00:34:00] a lot of times people are making things more complex.
[00:34:02] They don't even know it, because they're
[00:34:03] not considering things that I'm talking about.
[00:34:05] Sometimes they're screwing people over.
[00:34:06] They're not even thinking about it.
[00:34:08] Look, there's sometimes where I'm screwing over
[00:34:09] Echo with my decision, but I just don't think he's going
[00:34:13] to notice or I don't care.
[00:34:14] Sometimes I'm doing it, and I just,
[00:34:16] I don't even recognize the fact that, oh, I didn't realize
[00:34:19] Echo was going to get left out in the cold one time
[00:34:21] for you.
[00:34:23] Lath Bab and we were staying in a hotel at the muster,
[00:34:26] and we had like, I had a room, he had a room,
[00:34:30] and they were joined by like a unit room or whatever,
[00:34:37] like a, what's that word?
[00:34:39] A common area.
[00:34:40] Yeah, a common area.
[00:34:41] But actually, the entrance to my room
[00:34:45] was through the common area.
[00:34:47] And then, so to get into my room,
[00:34:48] you'd go through the common area,
[00:34:50] and then I'd go into my room.
[00:34:52] Lath had, he could go into the common area,
[00:34:54] and then to his room, or he could go through the hallway.
[00:34:57] So we went to PT, and I forget how it happened,
[00:35:01] but he locked the common area door.
[00:35:05] So, and then we got split up when I came back,
[00:35:08] I didn't have the key to his room.
[00:35:10] You know that little, you know, like the key,
[00:35:11] the mechanical lock on a door?
[00:35:14] He had swung that thing shut.
[00:35:15] So I could, so we were laughing.
[00:35:18] He was actually trying to help me out,
[00:35:20] but he locked me out of my room, which was awesome.
[00:35:23] Sure, awesome.
[00:35:24] He didn't know, he didn't know that,
[00:35:26] he didn't know that we were all both gonna leave
[00:35:30] through his room.
[00:35:31] So anyways, my point is, sometimes you're doing things,
[00:35:35] and you don't understand the secondary effects.
[00:35:38] So that's one of the benefits of having a checklist.
[00:35:42] Because the minute you say, oh, wait a second,
[00:35:45] the jockel might actually have to come back in,
[00:35:46] and I won't be with him,
[00:35:47] so therefore I should open the door from the inside.
[00:35:49] Cool, got it, done.
[00:35:52] Sometimes I say, oh, I wanna do this thing,
[00:35:55] oh, but am I really covering for echo?
[00:35:58] No, I'm not, I gotta help him out, okay.
[00:36:01] So one of the uses of running this loop,
[00:36:04] and going through this checklist,
[00:36:05] is you make sure you're not doing something
[00:36:07] that doesn't make sense,
[00:36:08] that you weren't aware of.
[00:36:11] So make sure that you are covering for the rest of your team,
[00:36:14] make sure you're putting the team first
[00:36:16] when you make a decision.
[00:36:18] Next one, simple.
[00:36:20] Well, I already covered simple,
[00:36:22] making sure things are complicated.
[00:36:23] The next one is prioritize and execute.
[00:36:24] Does this decision that I'm about to make
[00:36:29] match the priorities that we should be focused on?
[00:36:33] That's step number one.
[00:36:35] Hey, wait a second, I'm about to go in this direction.
[00:36:37] Does that even help us getting where we wanna go?
[00:36:40] Then you kinda have to dig a little bit deeper.
[00:36:42] Are the priorities that I'm focused on right now,
[00:36:44] are they even correct?
[00:36:46] Because sometimes what you're focused on right now changes,
[00:36:49] and you have to adapt.
[00:36:52] If you and I are rolling and I'm trying to defend an armlock,
[00:36:56] you're trying to armlock me,
[00:36:57] and all of a sudden you get my neck,
[00:36:59] guess what the priority is?
[00:37:00] Priority is my neck, protect your neck, right?
[00:37:04] So priorities are going to change.
[00:37:07] And so you have to make sure when you make a decision
[00:37:10] that you're supporting the right priority,
[00:37:12] or you're supporting the priority that you have designated,
[00:37:14] and you also have to double check that the priority
[00:37:17] that you're focused on is the right one,
[00:37:19] or the priorities plural that you're focused on
[00:37:22] are the right one's plural.
[00:37:26] And then once again, you gotta check your own tendencies
[00:37:30] because some people have a tendency to get distracted.
[00:37:34] And if you're a person that has tendency to get distracted,
[00:37:39] then you need to double down
[00:37:41] on making sure you focus on the right priorities.
[00:37:44] Some people have a tendency to try and accomplish too much.
[00:37:48] They have the tendency to be like,
[00:37:50] those people might usually have also a bad relationship
[00:37:53] with time where they think they can do more
[00:37:55] than they have time for,
[00:37:56] and then they also say, I can do that,
[00:37:57] I can do that, I can do that.
[00:37:59] Even though I have a good relationship with time,
[00:38:00] sometimes I do try and bite off more than I can chew,
[00:38:03] but not very often, most of the time I don't do that.
[00:38:06] Most of the time I could actually take the garbage out
[00:38:09] before I go to Jiu-Jitsu,
[00:38:11] but I don't wanna be two minutes late,
[00:38:13] so therefore I'm gonna take the garbage out later.
[00:38:15] I should have taken it out.
[00:38:16] I should have rolled the dice that there's a 0.001%
[00:38:21] that I'm a minute and 28 seconds late.
[00:38:26] So know what your tendencies.
[00:38:28] There's people that have a tendency
[00:38:29] to shift priorities too often,
[00:38:31] similar to being distracted, right?
[00:38:33] But they're like, no, we need to focus on this,
[00:38:34] and then three days later, no, we need to focus on this,
[00:38:36] and then three days later, no, we need to focus on this.
[00:38:38] That actually happens.
[00:38:41] And of course there's some people
[00:38:43] that get fixated on a priority that may or may not matter
[00:38:49] as time goes on, so that can happen as well.
[00:38:53] So when you are making a decision,
[00:38:56] check your priority list,
[00:39:00] and make sure that your decision supports the priority,
[00:39:02] and then also double check that the priority you're focused on
[00:39:05] or priorities that you are focused on are the right ones.
[00:39:08] Pretty straightforward.
[00:39:10] Decentralize command.
[00:39:13] Here's a really good rule of thumb
[00:39:16] if you're in a leadership position.
[00:39:18] The decision that I'm about to make,
[00:39:20] can I decentralize and delegate the action?
[00:39:28] So as soon as I'm thinking of doing something,
[00:39:30] I think to myself, oh, can I turn this over to someone else?
[00:39:37] So hey, we gotta get that building cleared?
[00:39:40] Yes, we're gonna clear that building.
[00:39:42] Hey, Laef, grab your squad, grab your platoon,
[00:39:45] grab your team, go get that building cleared.
[00:39:47] Can I turn it over to someone else?
[00:39:49] Hey, Echo, we need to come up with some cool graphics
[00:39:54] for this event that we're gonna do.
[00:39:56] Can I turn that over to you?
[00:39:58] I wanna know if I can, because my goal is to not be focused
[00:40:03] on doing things myself, because the minute
[00:40:06] that I'm doing something myself,
[00:40:08] I can't look up and I can't look out,
[00:40:11] which is going to impair my ability to lead.
[00:40:14] This also allows me to be aware.
[00:40:17] And again, so much of this is awareness.
[00:40:19] It allows me to be aware that sometimes
[00:40:21] there's something that I do have to do.
[00:40:23] And I've gotta say, hey, Echo,
[00:40:25] I've gotta go do this thing, cover me.
[00:40:27] Or hey, Echo, I'm gonna be going and executing
[00:40:30] on this thing, watch my back,
[00:40:33] or look up and out while I'm doing this.
[00:40:35] So these are all things that, again,
[00:40:37] it's okay to make those decisions
[00:40:39] as long as you're aware of it.
[00:40:40] But the minute I go, hey, I'm gonna go execute this thing
[00:40:43] and I don't tell you to look out, now we get flanked.
[00:40:49] We're looking, hopefully, with decentralized command,
[00:40:52] we're hoping, and the goal is that we are only doing things
[00:40:56] that only we can do.
[00:40:58] I only wanna do things that only I can do.
[00:41:01] Everything else, I wanna have someone else on the team do it.
[00:41:05] That's the goal.
[00:41:07] And by the way, the things that I can do,
[00:41:09] I eventually want to train someone else
[00:41:11] to be able to do those things.
[00:41:13] How do you balance the,
[00:41:17] okay, remember, it was your story about
[00:41:22] somebody came to you, it was like,
[00:41:23] I need this advice, whatever,
[00:41:24] and you said, put them in charge of something they put,
[00:41:26] and then that person put them in charge of something
[00:41:28] that was really undesirable, like cleaning.
[00:41:30] Cleaning toilets at SEAL Team 2 on the second deck.
[00:41:34] That was the mission someone was tasked with
[00:41:36] in order to give them more responsibility.
[00:41:38] And it didn't help the situation, it made them more mad.
[00:41:40] So how do you find the balance?
[00:41:42] Because kinda in a way that kinda,
[00:41:44] in a matter of speaking, translates over to
[00:41:46] what you're talking about now where it's like,
[00:41:48] hey, can I delegate this?
[00:41:49] Can I delegate this?
[00:41:50] Which a lot of times, depending on the project
[00:41:53] of delegation, it can empower someone,
[00:41:56] it can help the whole group, because they can do this
[00:41:58] while you're doing quote unquote more important things
[00:42:00] or whatever.
[00:42:01] How do you balance what you delegate them to do
[00:42:03] with something important or whatever versus something that,
[00:42:07] cause you know something needs to be done
[00:42:09] but no one really wants to do it kind of a thing?
[00:42:11] Hey, if something sucks, I'm gonna get in there
[00:42:14] and do it somehow.
[00:42:15] This is the picking up brass story, right?
[00:42:17] Because picking up brass, it's real easy to say,
[00:42:20] you know what guys, I gotta go back to
[00:42:22] meet with the commanding officer,
[00:42:23] I gotta go back and prep a brief,
[00:42:24] so I'll be back in the air conditioned office,
[00:42:26] back in San Diego, while you guys are out here
[00:42:28] in 120 degree heat picking up brass.
[00:42:31] Real easy to say that.
[00:42:33] So decisions like that, I'm gonna be very cautious
[00:42:37] and I'm gonna weigh my leadership capital,
[00:42:39] which we'll get to, because if, look,
[00:42:42] does this mean if the commanding officer's like,
[00:42:43] hey, I need a brief tomorrow, I'm like,
[00:42:44] sorry sir, I'm picking up brass?
[00:42:46] No, it doesn't mean that.
[00:42:48] But I better prioritize building a relationship
[00:42:54] with the troops, making sure they understand
[00:42:55] that I don't mind getting my hands dirty,
[00:42:57] don't mind getting my knees freaking cut up,
[00:43:00] don't mind having blisters on my hands
[00:43:02] and picking up hot brass out in the desert.
[00:43:05] That's what I'm gonna do.
[00:43:07] So there's some variables that we have to weigh into.
[00:43:11] And that's also why good deals give them away, you know?
[00:43:16] Hey, someone's gotta go ashore early
[00:43:18] and spend an extra four days in wherever,
[00:43:22] this nice vacation area of Thailand.
[00:43:26] It's like, oh, no, I'm gonna go on the ad bond.
[00:43:29] And it's like, no, no, hey, echo, you gotta take these guys,
[00:43:33] make sure we have the stuff that we need
[00:43:35] for the training in Thailand.
[00:43:36] And you're like, awesome, right?
[00:43:38] So that's how I weigh it out.
[00:43:40] I have to assess the suck meter.
[00:43:45] And if you're a person that always sees the suck meter high
[00:43:48] and runs the other way, everybody knows it.
[00:43:51] So don't do it.
[00:43:53] So it's kind of a little balancing act game
[00:43:55] within the game kind of a thing.
[00:43:56] 100%.
[00:43:57] Yeah, because if you just be rigid,
[00:43:59] or this is what it seems like anyway,
[00:44:00] if you just be rigid to the, hey, I'm always gonna delegate
[00:44:03] and then it's when it comes to, you know,
[00:44:06] oh, trash needs to be taken out.
[00:44:08] I got an extra three minutes or whatever now,
[00:44:11] but no, no, no, I'm sticking to the rule.
[00:44:12] Delegate, delegate, you know, kind of a thing.
[00:44:14] No, things that suck, try not to delegate.
[00:44:18] And look, that could also mean
[00:44:20] if you're the platoon commander,
[00:44:22] guess what you're doing all day?
[00:44:24] Cleaning the toilets, picking up brass,
[00:44:26] like you could be, you get to sign yourself
[00:44:27] every task that kind of sucks.
[00:44:30] And we don't wanna do that.
[00:44:31] So we have to put that into the calculus.
[00:44:34] We don't just delegate things that suck.
[00:44:36] In fact, you know, the late, late tells the story,
[00:44:39] we were going through the our dive portion of training
[00:44:43] and diving kind of sucks, you know,
[00:44:46] it's cold, wet, miserable, long, boring.
[00:44:49] And some people think,
[00:44:51] and so a lot of guys had given the opportunity,
[00:44:54] they have meetings to attend during time.
[00:44:56] They have whatever reports to write.
[00:45:00] And Leif and Seth, you know,
[00:45:03] they were kind of like surprised,
[00:45:04] here I am, got my wetsuit on, got my fins out,
[00:45:07] we're ready to go dive,
[00:45:08] ready to go spend four hours turtle backing around
[00:45:10] San Diego Bay and picking three hours on bag
[00:45:14] in the darkness, you know, bored out of your mind,
[00:45:18] but that's what you do.
[00:45:19] So that's one of those things where if it sucks,
[00:45:24] use caution while delegating.
[00:45:27] Make sense?
[00:45:28] Fully, yeah, fully.
[00:45:29] It's the kind of more of the approach to it, right?
[00:45:33] Where it's like, you gotta understand the overall picture
[00:45:35] of what are you doing here, you know?
[00:45:37] And why are you doing it kind of a thing?
[00:45:38] So if you have more important things to do,
[00:45:41] you delegate these things,
[00:45:43] they're all important because they're all pieces
[00:45:44] of the puzzle.
[00:45:46] But yeah, there's another, like I said, game kind of
[00:45:49] going on where you wanna be looking out for everyone
[00:45:54] in that little additional way, you know?
[00:45:57] And you're gonna sacrifice little parts of kind of yourself
[00:46:00] to kind of do it.
[00:46:05] So we kind of got the four laws of combat covered.
[00:46:08] The next thing I'm gonna think about,
[00:46:10] and this is a big one,
[00:46:13] is making sure that our ego is not driving this decision,
[00:46:17] which you would be shocked and dismayed
[00:46:20] at the number of decisions that are driven by ego.
[00:46:26] Driven by ego.
[00:46:28] They're almost 100% in some cases driven by ego.
[00:46:32] Am I making this decision based on my ego?
[00:46:36] Am I imposing it as punishment,
[00:46:40] subconscious punishment on someone who questioned me?
[00:46:43] Am I forcing this to prove to echo
[00:46:49] that my plan was the better plan?
[00:46:54] So you have to be extremely cautious of that.
[00:46:58] And the thing that we have to be careful of
[00:47:00] is that our ego can absolutely, not even,
[00:47:05] your ego is going to lie to you.
[00:47:07] That's what our ego does.
[00:47:08] Our ego is going to lie to us.
[00:47:11] And if it's tricky too,
[00:47:13] your ego's smart, your ego's, it's like the devil.
[00:47:17] You ever seen the movie The Exorcist?
[00:47:19] Yes.
[00:47:20] So in the movie The Exorcist,
[00:47:21] the devil knows the things to say to the priest
[00:47:26] that's gonna get him.
[00:47:29] And your ego is equally smart as the devil.
[00:47:34] And it knows, my ego's like,
[00:47:36] hey, hey, Jocko, I know I get extreme ownership.
[00:47:41] Hey, I buy into extreme ownership 100%.
[00:47:45] But this time is actually really is Echo's fault.
[00:47:49] Echo's plan's really not as good as yours.
[00:47:52] I get it.
[00:47:53] I know you wanna be humble,
[00:47:55] but hey, if you're humble now,
[00:47:56] it's actually gonna cost you in the long run.
[00:47:58] That's the way your ego talks to you.
[00:48:00] It's like a little savage in there, just manipulating.
[00:48:04] So you gotta be very careful of that.
[00:48:06] The other thing that happens is,
[00:48:08] if your ego's running the decision,
[00:48:10] have you listened to anybody else?
[00:48:12] Have you listened to other people with an open mind?
[00:48:17] Do you have an open mind?
[00:48:19] So be careful of that.
[00:48:20] Cause sometimes we're listening, but we're not hearing.
[00:48:24] And then a good little sanity check,
[00:48:26] am I doing this?
[00:48:28] Am I using this decision?
[00:48:30] Am I driving this decision with my rank,
[00:48:34] with my position?
[00:48:37] Even with my experience.
[00:48:38] And let me explain what that sounds like.
[00:48:40] The idea of driving, it sounds good, right?
[00:48:43] It sounds good for me to say,
[00:48:44] hey, I'm more experienced.
[00:48:46] That's why I'm making this decision.
[00:48:48] But that's the equivalent as,
[00:48:51] dude, I've been doing this for 20 years.
[00:48:53] You need to shut up and listen to me.
[00:48:56] Any of those things, if the main driver of your decision
[00:49:01] and the way you're convincing people is through experience
[00:49:03] or through rank or through position or authority,
[00:49:06] you already lost.
[00:49:07] You already, let me just say you lost,
[00:49:10] but you need to reconsider what's happening.
[00:49:12] Because if I can't articulate to you, Echo Charles,
[00:49:15] why I made this decision without saying,
[00:49:17] cause I outrank you or because I'm in charge of this
[00:49:20] or because I've done this type of thing 20 times,
[00:49:23] if I have to go there, that means I'm not really,
[00:49:26] I can't articulate why we're going with my plan.
[00:49:28] And that's a problem.
[00:49:29] And the problem most likely is my ego.
[00:49:33] So use caution on that.
[00:49:35] And right tied up next to that is emotion.
[00:49:41] Am I making an emotional decision?
[00:49:45] I mean, what a smart little thing to check on.
[00:49:50] And if you check on it, you're gonna realize
[00:49:54] that it's a bad move.
[00:49:56] People make emotional decisions all the time.
[00:49:58] And by the way, they almost never turn out good.
[00:50:01] Am I mad?
[00:50:02] Am I frustrated?
[00:50:03] Am I vengeful?
[00:50:07] Am I fearful?
[00:50:10] Am I guilty?
[00:50:12] Guilt is an emotion.
[00:50:14] That'll make you do something
[00:50:15] that you know you shouldn't do.
[00:50:17] Fear is an emotion that'll make you do something
[00:50:19] that you shouldn't do.
[00:50:22] Frustration.
[00:50:23] I'm getting frustrated.
[00:50:24] You don't want to just go ahead and do it, right?
[00:50:26] These are horrible things.
[00:50:29] So check with yourself and make sure
[00:50:32] that your emotions are not driving the decision.
[00:50:34] Now listen, here's the other thing.
[00:50:35] Here's the dichotomy.
[00:50:37] Is your emotions do still have to be part of the calculus?
[00:50:40] They gotta be part of the calculus.
[00:50:42] You gotta calculate your own emotions to get the answer.
[00:50:46] You gotta calculate the emotions of the team
[00:50:49] to get the answer.
[00:50:50] Because if the team is all mad about doing this thing.
[00:50:54] And I say, you know what though?
[00:50:55] Logically, we should do it.
[00:50:57] All right guys, this is the logical answer.
[00:50:59] Go do it.
[00:50:59] And all it does is make everyone matter.
[00:51:01] First of all, are you gonna execute well?
[00:51:03] Are you gonna do a good job?
[00:51:04] Are you trustworthy while you're out there and you're mad?
[00:51:06] What did it do to my leadership capital?
[00:51:07] All these problems is gonna cause.
[00:51:10] All these problems is gonna cause.
[00:51:11] So I have to put emotions into the calculus.
[00:51:17] But it can't be the overwhelming driver
[00:51:20] of my decision making.
[00:51:22] It has to be a component.
[00:51:24] But it should be a small component in most cases.
[00:51:28] Meaning, if I know that making some decision
[00:51:31] is gonna make the entire team totally irate.
[00:51:34] I need to wait it a little bit more
[00:51:35] because the emotion is stronger.
[00:51:38] But you have to calculate it.
[00:51:41] And if you're not aware of it,
[00:51:43] if you're not paying attention to it,
[00:51:44] then it's not gonna work out the way you want it to.
[00:51:47] It's gonna actually cause bad decisions.
[00:51:53] Next one, perspective.
[00:51:54] Perspective people throw this around.
[00:51:59] People throw this around.
[00:52:00] Make sure you know what other people's perspectives is.
[00:52:04] But they only throw it around when they think about it.
[00:52:07] But a lot of times we get locked into our perspective
[00:52:11] and that's bad.
[00:52:13] I wanna see as many different perspectives on a subject,
[00:52:16] on a topic, on an idea that I can.
[00:52:19] I wanna know my peers' perspectives.
[00:52:21] I wanna know my subordinates' perspectives.
[00:52:22] I wanna know my superiors' perspectives.
[00:52:24] I wanna know my competitors or my enemies' perspective.
[00:52:27] What are they actually seeing right now?
[00:52:29] The more angles I see of a target or of a problem,
[00:52:36] the better I can understand it.
[00:52:40] And the better I can understand it,
[00:52:42] the better off I'm going to be.
[00:52:45] And we have this thing when you do a reconnaissance
[00:52:48] of a target, a building or a compound.
[00:52:53] When you do it, what you try and do is you try
[00:52:55] and move around the entire perimeter over a period of time.
[00:52:58] You try and see it from every different possible angle.
[00:53:01] If you don't see something from every possible angle,
[00:53:03] there's something that you're missing.
[00:53:04] And that thing that you're missing
[00:53:06] could be a critical component of the target
[00:53:09] or of the problem.
[00:53:11] So by asking your subordinates,
[00:53:13] hey, what does this look like to you?
[00:53:15] By asking your peers, like, hey, what do you see here?
[00:53:17] By asking your boss, hey, what does it look like
[00:53:18] from your perspective?
[00:53:20] By doing that, it's gonna give you a better understanding
[00:53:24] of the target, of the problem, of the issue,
[00:53:26] and then you can better formulate a plan.
[00:53:28] And by the way, my default mode
[00:53:33] is to take, when someone else says,
[00:53:37] hey, Jocko, I see a solution,
[00:53:39] my default mode is to try and utilize their solution,
[00:53:41] try and utilize their plan, try and utilize their idea.
[00:53:44] That's my default mode.
[00:53:48] Now, if there's a leadership vacuum,
[00:53:49] and I wrote about this in leadership strategy tactics,
[00:53:51] field manual, if there's a vacuum,
[00:53:53] no one's making a decision, sure.
[00:53:55] I'm gonna step in.
[00:53:57] I'm gonna give you some little hints here.
[00:54:00] When there's a leadership vacuum,
[00:54:01] I'm gonna let that leadership vacuum develop it
[00:54:04] a little bit extra, just a little bit extra.
[00:54:06] I'm gonna let that void, let the presence of that silence,
[00:54:10] of that non-direction, of that lack of leadership.
[00:54:13] I'm gonna let it sit there for an extra second, two seconds.
[00:54:18] Why am I doing that?
[00:54:19] Because I want everyone to know
[00:54:21] that there's a leadership void.
[00:54:23] And it doesn't take long, it takes a second,
[00:54:24] it takes two seconds, three seconds.
[00:54:25] And all of a sudden, everyone goes,
[00:54:27] oh, and when everyone knows there's a leadership void,
[00:54:29] everyone is primed to execute.
[00:54:32] Everyone is ready to receive orders.
[00:54:37] So, if there's a leadership void,
[00:54:40] I'm gonna make sure everyone can feel it.
[00:54:41] By the way, those extra two, three seconds,
[00:54:42] I'm actually confirming the plan in my head
[00:54:45] that I have formulated.
[00:54:46] So now my plan is gonna be two or three seconds
[00:54:48] further developed and better.
[00:54:51] And then I make the call.
[00:54:52] And yes, I'm gonna make a small call, an iterative decision.
[00:54:56] And if someone else happens to make a call at the same time,
[00:55:00] guess what I'm gonna do?
[00:55:01] I'm gonna support their call.
[00:55:03] Because that's my default mode.
[00:55:06] My default mode is to support someone else's call.
[00:55:11] Because that is the easiest way to move forward with a plan.
[00:55:14] The easiest way to move forward with a plan
[00:55:16] isn't with Echo has a plan and I have a plan
[00:55:18] to try and convince Echo that my plan is better.
[00:55:21] The easiest way, the quickest way to move is to say,
[00:55:23] Echo, sounds good, I'm on board.
[00:55:25] What do you want me to do?
[00:55:26] How can I support?
[00:55:27] Unless Echo's plan is freaking horrible.
[00:55:32] Actually, let me rephrase that in a more distinct way.
[00:55:36] Unless Echo's plan is unviable.
[00:55:39] It's an unviable plan that will not work.
[00:55:42] If it's a minimally viable plan,
[00:55:46] it'll get the job done.
[00:55:47] You have a minimally viable plan and I have a viable plan.
[00:55:50] So that means mine might be a little bit better.
[00:55:52] But now I have to convince you of that.
[00:55:54] I have to explain why.
[00:55:55] And by the way, when I say I'm gonna support your plan,
[00:55:57] I can probably bring some additional viability
[00:55:59] to your plan that can make your plan better
[00:56:01] than mine was in the first place.
[00:56:02] So that's what I'm gonna do.
[00:56:05] That's the easiest way to do it.
[00:56:06] Now, what do we need to think about here?
[00:56:09] Is we need to think about the fact that we almost all,
[00:56:12] here's a bias, that almost all of us have the same bias,
[00:56:15] which is my idea is the best idea.
[00:56:17] That's our general consideration as humans.
[00:56:22] My idea is the best idea.
[00:56:25] So know that you have that bias.
[00:56:27] I actually go hard against that bias.
[00:56:29] And quite frankly, sometimes I go too hard against that bias.
[00:56:34] Sometimes someone's got a plan, I'm like, eh.
[00:56:36] And it might be minimally, really minimally viable.
[00:56:42] And I'll be like, you know what, we'll go with it.
[00:56:44] Sometimes I do that a little bit too much.
[00:56:47] So I know that.
[00:56:48] Why do you think you do that?
[00:56:50] Just wanna be supportive.
[00:56:52] Don't wanna be a imposing tyrant on the team.
[00:56:56] And generally, I'm like, thinking to myself,
[00:57:00] oh, you know, my plan's good,
[00:57:01] but we can probably make Eglas' plan worth.
[00:57:03] I would rather do it.
[00:57:04] Why? I'll tell you why.
[00:57:05] I literally believe what I'm saying right now.
[00:57:07] It's usually easier for me just to support your plan
[00:57:09] than it is for me to convince you of this other plan
[00:57:12] and explain it to you.
[00:57:13] I can uptake your plan pretty quick.
[00:57:14] I get it cool, let's go execute that thing.
[00:57:16] I'm supporting you, let's run with it.
[00:57:18] And then I'm detached from your plan
[00:57:20] so I can see a little bit more when it's my plan.
[00:57:22] All of a sudden, I gotta manage that whole thing
[00:57:24] and I'm staring right into it.
[00:57:25] And I don't know how good you are at being detached
[00:57:28] and trying to adjust things.
[00:57:29] You might not be as good as me.
[00:57:30] So you know what?
[00:57:30] I'm gonna let you, detachment is a harder skill
[00:57:34] than the planning and execution.
[00:57:38] Or it's a rarer skill.
[00:57:40] If I tell you to go and execute something,
[00:57:42] there's a good chance you'll be able to do it.
[00:57:45] If I tell you, hey, I'm gonna go execute,
[00:57:47] you detach and sit on the outside
[00:57:50] and try and give me some broad guidance
[00:57:53] about how I can do better.
[00:57:54] That's a harder job.
[00:57:55] Because most of the time you'll be like,
[00:57:58] I'm starting to execute my plan,
[00:57:59] you're gonna jump in there with me,
[00:58:00] you're gonna start doing it too.
[00:58:02] So that's why I sort of overindex on allowing,
[00:58:07] on providing support or allowing people to do things
[00:58:10] that maybe I don't 100% agree with.
[00:58:13] I mean, you've done some stuff where I've been like,
[00:58:16] well, that didn't seem to be the best idea, was it?
[00:58:21] And we can look back post-mortem.
[00:58:24] Is this a Christmas music thing?
[00:58:25] Christmas music, that's a good one, right?
[00:58:27] Get that over it.
[00:58:28] You know, some things happen, you're like,
[00:58:31] you're not good, that's not what we were looking for at all.
[00:58:34] Did you say you didn't even know that was a Christmas song?
[00:58:36] Damn, that's correct.
[00:58:38] They know, I don't know, sorry.
[00:58:40] I do now though, so.
[00:58:42] You gotta watch out for that one.
[00:58:43] So that's the deal.
[00:58:45] It's perspective, you have to actually pull yourself back
[00:58:50] and try and see other people's perspectives.
[00:58:53] And the best way to do that is by talking to them,
[00:58:55] asking them good questions about what they see.
[00:58:57] You're not gonna be a freak and, what's the word?
[00:59:02] A psychic that I can see what Echo sees.
[00:59:06] I don't go into a meditative state
[00:59:07] and go into your brain.
[00:59:09] No, I go, hey Echo, what does that look like to you?
[00:59:11] This isn't freaking, this isn't freaking remote viewing.
[00:59:15] This isn't remote viewing.
[00:59:17] This isn't remote viewing.
[00:59:18] What's the deal with Rome?
[00:59:19] Do you think it's true?
[00:59:20] I don't know.
[00:59:21] They had big programs with it in the military.
[00:59:23] There's a movie about it.
[00:59:24] Yeah, I mean, I don't, if it is true,
[00:59:27] I don't know how it works at all.
[00:59:29] It doesn't seem.
[00:59:30] It could be, the guys are really good at guessing.
[00:59:32] Maybe, you know.
[00:59:33] Well, a lot of the, what do you call it,
[00:59:35] like the psychic, you know, mediums and minorities
[00:59:38] and stuff, that's as it turns out from what I understand,
[00:59:40] that's what it is.
[00:59:41] It's not guessing, but it's like guessing about,
[00:59:44] like they react to cues with you,
[00:59:47] like how you respond.
[00:59:48] So it's like, I'm seeing red.
[00:59:49] And then if they do something, they're like,
[00:59:50] okay, red is something, you know?
[00:59:52] Do you know a person name?
[00:59:54] And they go real basic names first?
[00:59:56] Cause I'm feeling a John or a Jim.
[00:59:58] Yeah, yeah, but it would be even broader.
[01:00:00] It's like, do you know anyone that's,
[01:00:03] do you know anyone that's experienced trouble
[01:00:05] in their life right now?
[01:00:06] And if I see you like, that I'm like, wait,
[01:00:09] are they sick?
[01:00:10] You know what I mean?
[01:00:11] And at the same time, my mind is awake.
[01:00:13] Do I?
[01:00:13] Then I search for everyone in my whole,
[01:00:15] it's like, whether it's significant or not,
[01:00:17] you kind of make it significant.
[01:00:18] So it's like a dance going on.
[01:00:19] Maybe we'll have a remote viewer on the program.
[01:00:22] Cause the military had like a remote viewer group.
[01:00:26] People that, that's what they did.
[01:00:28] Sit in a room and go into a meditative state
[01:00:30] and look for, you know, missile launch pads,
[01:00:35] stuff like this.
[01:00:36] I guess the argument for and against it,
[01:00:39] in a matter of speaking, is kind of the same thing
[01:00:41] where it's like, your brain is so complex.
[01:00:43] And we, you know, there's a lot of stuff about your brain
[01:00:45] and all this stuff that we don't know.
[01:00:48] So it's possible, but at the same time,
[01:00:51] it's kind of like, all right, well,
[01:00:53] I don't see how your eyes can like see something
[01:00:56] that they don't see and it's your brain, you know,
[01:00:59] like it doesn't make sense.
[01:01:00] Given what we do know, it doesn't make sense.
[01:01:01] Eddie Bravo has a podcast now
[01:01:03] and it's called, Look Into It.
[01:01:05] I think it's called Look Into It,
[01:01:07] which is a freaking great name.
[01:01:08] And this makes me think, you know,
[01:01:10] maybe we need to get Eddie Bravo to look into it
[01:01:12] and see what's up, see what's up with remote viewing.
[01:01:15] Cause he's looking into a bunch of stuff.
[01:01:17] Oh yeah. You know why it's called Look Into It?
[01:01:20] I think it's cause of what I just said.
[01:01:21] Is there another reason?
[01:01:22] Yeah. Well, that's the thing that there was a,
[01:01:24] Oh, is it a meme?
[01:01:26] Kind of that he, he was on a podcast.
[01:01:29] I forget which one it was, but it was one,
[01:01:31] you know, one of Joe Rogan's podcasts.
[01:01:32] He was on there and then they got into this heated
[01:01:34] like argument about, you know,
[01:01:37] one of the things that Eddie Bravo really kind of reports.
[01:01:39] Maybe wasn't UFOs, what was it?
[01:01:41] I don't know, 9-Eleven maybe.
[01:01:43] I don't know.
[01:01:44] I forget what it was, but he kept saying,
[01:01:46] you just haven't looked into it.
[01:01:48] You just haven't looked into it kind of, you know what I mean?
[01:01:50] That was kind of his defense to a lot of things.
[01:01:52] But he said it so many times that like it became a thing.
[01:01:55] Well, it's a great name for his podcast.
[01:01:57] Cause I said, what are you doing?
[01:01:58] It's out there looking into it.
[01:02:00] The weird thing about looking into things these days
[01:02:03] is you can kind of find what you want to find.
[01:02:04] Whatever you want.
[01:02:05] Yeah, that's true.
[01:02:06] There's all kinds of things to find what you want.
[01:02:10] Yeah.
[01:02:10] To find.
[01:02:11] If you look into it.
[01:02:12] If you look into it.
[01:02:13] People enough.
[01:02:14] Well, yeah.
[01:02:15] And okay, so we have this trampoline.
[01:02:17] It's called a rebounder.
[01:02:19] It's like essentially like a regular little trampoline,
[01:02:21] but it's like, I don't know, more robust.
[01:02:25] I don't know, whatever.
[01:02:26] How big is it?
[01:02:26] Like the regular size ones, like this table,
[01:02:28] maybe a little bigger.
[01:02:29] That's not a regular size.
[01:02:30] So when I think trampoline,
[01:02:31] I think of something that you, that is like 15 feet across.
[01:02:34] Yeah.
[01:02:35] Like a leg breaker.
[01:02:36] Yeah.
[01:02:37] But this thing is like one of those fitness trampolines
[01:02:40] when you jump on it.
[01:02:41] Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:42] But it's the one where it's like, there's no noise.
[01:02:44] It's called a rebounder.
[01:02:45] If I'm not mistaken.
[01:02:46] So anyway, one of the claims is that,
[01:02:49] oh yeah, it does something to your lymph system.
[01:02:52] Okay.
[01:02:53] Like it like does something to it.
[01:02:55] Elevates it somehow.
[01:02:57] Makes it better.
[01:02:57] Yeah.
[01:02:58] You know, the pressure and here's the thing.
[01:03:00] That could be a hundred percent true.
[01:03:02] It could be.
[01:03:02] Well, look into it.
[01:03:03] Yeah, you look into it.
[01:03:04] So I go and look in and you know, my wife,
[01:03:06] she's like saying, yeah, my dad told me and this,
[01:03:08] and he has one and let's face it.
[01:03:10] The kids jump on it.
[01:03:11] It's fun.
[01:03:12] That's my main kind of catalyst or whatever.
[01:03:14] You didn't even have to look into that.
[01:03:15] Yep.
[01:03:16] Then lymph or no lymph systems.
[01:03:18] It's fun.
[01:03:19] The kids freaking love it and whatever.
[01:03:20] It's good for your legs too, obviously.
[01:03:24] But I'm like, if I'm going to talk trash,
[01:03:26] which I do just jokingly because I don't,
[01:03:28] I don't know if it helps your lymph system or not.
[01:03:31] If I'm going to talk trash,
[01:03:32] I should at least look into it.
[01:03:34] So I looked into it and sure enough,
[01:03:36] it says, yeah, it does this, your lymph system,
[01:03:38] but then just like what you're eluding to
[01:03:41] where you kind of got to consider the source, you know?
[01:03:44] And then, oh, what, what I'm gonna spend my day
[01:03:47] looking into this five websites that said this.
[01:03:49] Now I got to determine the credibility.
[01:03:51] So it's like hard, you know?
[01:03:52] Yeah.
[01:03:53] There's all kinds of credit.
[01:03:54] Cause you can make a website that has,
[01:03:56] oh, click here for the supporting documentation,
[01:03:58] but you also wrote the supporting documentation, right?
[01:04:01] So even when you're looking into it,
[01:04:03] you're not looking in the right place.
[01:04:05] Yeah, it's true, man.
[01:04:07] Holy cow.
[01:04:09] What platform is Eddie Bravo's?
[01:04:12] Do you know what, it's on a platform.
[01:04:14] I don't know if it's on an open platform.
[01:04:16] Oh, I don't know.
[01:04:17] I have to look into it.
[01:04:18] I got to look into it.
[01:04:20] So there you go.
[01:04:23] Perspective.
[01:04:24] You got to look into some other people's perspectives
[01:04:27] and figure out what the whole target,
[01:04:31] what the whole problem looks like.
[01:04:33] So there you go.
[01:04:34] Perspective.
[01:04:35] Spend some time.
[01:04:37] Put that on your checklist.
[01:04:38] The perspective you have, by the way,
[01:04:40] is not the whole thing.
[01:04:41] And there's a good chance that your perspective
[01:04:43] is actually wrong, right?
[01:04:44] Hey, I don't see any enemy on this target.
[01:04:46] All you need to do is go 90 degrees in the other direction.
[01:04:48] You can see a bunch of enemies sitting behind a building.
[01:04:52] Hey, make your bias that your perspective
[01:04:55] is probably a little bit off.
[01:04:56] Maybe even make your bias that you're wrong.
[01:04:59] That what you see is not the whole picture.
[01:05:02] That what you see is actually a bad picture.
[01:05:05] That's what I think of my perspective.
[01:05:09] I think, you know what?
[01:05:10] This is what I see.
[01:05:11] And I know my gut instinct is like,
[01:05:14] I know I don't not see everything.
[01:05:16] And there's more to the picture
[01:05:17] and I need to figure out what that is.
[01:05:19] Make that part of your checklist.
[01:05:21] Next thing is mission.
[01:05:27] So is the decision that you're about to make,
[01:05:31] does it support the mission
[01:05:32] that you're actually trying to execute on?
[01:05:36] And not actually more important than that,
[01:05:38] does it support your overall strategic mission?
[01:05:43] And this causes all kinds of, there's a term out there.
[01:05:47] Have you heard term mission creep?
[01:05:48] Yeah.
[01:05:49] Yeah, it's a pretty common term now.
[01:05:51] This is because people don't run this leadership loop
[01:05:53] in their brain and they don't ask themselves,
[01:05:55] hold on a second, what's our mission?
[01:05:56] What's our overall mission?
[01:05:57] And is this in support of it?
[01:05:59] If I make this decision,
[01:05:59] it's gonna help us reach our strategic goals.
[01:06:02] All kinds of people make that mistake.
[01:06:05] And we can't allow for that.
[01:06:07] So what you do is you just run a quick check and say,
[01:06:10] hold on, does this support the tactical mission
[01:06:13] that we're trying to execute?
[01:06:14] Does this support the strategic mission
[01:06:17] that we're trying to achieve?
[01:06:18] And if it doesn't, you know it's a bad decision.
[01:06:22] Next one, leadership capital.
[01:06:27] And this is one that I recently added to this list.
[01:06:29] And the reason that I added to the list
[01:06:31] is because at some point I was having a discussion
[01:06:35] with somebody and I realized, actually,
[01:06:38] let me rephrase this, I was making a decision
[01:06:41] and I realized that the main thing that I was calculating
[01:06:46] was how much this was gonna cost me
[01:06:47] from a leadership capital perspective.
[01:06:50] And so first of all, what is leadership capital?
[01:06:53] Leadership capital is the fact
[01:06:55] that you can only get people to do so much.
[01:07:01] As a leader, you can only get people to do so much.
[01:07:05] When you ask somebody to do something, it costs.
[01:07:09] It costs you leadership capital.
[01:07:13] And if they don't wanna do it, it costs more.
[01:07:17] And if they wanna do it, then it costs less.
[01:07:21] And if they do it on their own accord,
[01:07:24] then it's very cheap, maybe even free.
[01:07:26] And if you let them do what they want,
[01:07:27] you're kinda collecting some leadership capital.
[01:07:30] So just the very, any interaction that I have
[01:07:34] with Echo Charles, if I say, hey, get this done.
[01:07:39] Hey, do this, hey, make a video about this.
[01:07:43] That cost me leadership capital.
[01:07:45] Cost me leadership capital.
[01:07:48] Especially if you don't wanna do it.
[01:07:51] It's costing me even more.
[01:07:52] Now look, I might have some leadership capital with you
[01:07:54] and you're like, all right, fine, I'll do it.
[01:07:55] If you wanna do it, if I'm like,
[01:07:59] hey, make a video with robots exploding,
[01:08:01] you're like, oh, hell yeah.
[01:08:03] It didn't cost me very much.
[01:08:05] Now if I say to you, man, I wish we had more videos
[01:08:09] with robots exploding, you were like, dude,
[01:08:11] I'm gonna make a sick one.
[01:08:13] That's very cheap.
[01:08:15] You're still working, so maybe it cost me a little something.
[01:08:18] But if I say, hey man, I have no idea what to do,
[01:08:22] what do you think we should do?
[01:08:23] And you're like, we need to make a video
[01:08:24] with robots exploding.
[01:08:25] I go, that's awesome.
[01:08:27] I actually gained some leadership capital.
[01:08:30] So everything, when people are interacting with you,
[01:08:33] are there's gonna be leadership capital spent?
[01:08:35] And by the way, every interaction that I have with you,
[01:08:41] never mind just a task, but when we interact with each other,
[01:08:43] there's leadership capital being exchanged.
[01:08:49] And we as people always think we have
[01:08:52] more leadership capital than we do.
[01:08:57] Here's a couple of things that will throw you for a loop.
[01:08:59] You think rank gives you a bunch of leadership capital?
[01:09:02] It doesn't.
[01:09:03] It doesn't.
[01:09:04] Rank, it gives you a little tiny bit.
[01:09:07] Because hey man, obviously I'm in this position
[01:09:09] and you haven't been here as long as me
[01:09:11] and I've done this stuff before.
[01:09:13] So there's an element of leadership capital
[01:09:15] that comes with rank.
[01:09:18] But it's not as much as we think.
[01:09:20] Actually when I give ownership to someone,
[01:09:23] when I say, hey Echo, you go ahead and run this project
[01:09:25] the way you want.
[01:09:26] You seem to have a good grasp on it.
[01:09:28] That actually earns me leadership capital.
[01:09:29] So giving ownership earns leadership capital.
[01:09:33] Listening to someone as simple as that might sound
[01:09:36] gives me leadership capital.
[01:09:38] When you come to me and say,
[01:09:39] I want to talk to you about something,
[01:09:40] I go, oh, I get out my notebook
[01:09:42] and I say, hey, tell me what you got.
[01:09:43] You're like, I have this idea of doing this
[01:09:45] and I'm writing it down.
[01:09:46] That gives me leadership capital.
[01:09:49] You could do like a little, whether it be fresh on front
[01:09:52] or whatever, you could do like a fun little quiz.
[01:09:55] And it's like leadership capital quiz.
[01:09:58] Is this spending it or earning it?
[01:10:00] And you could do little things.
[01:10:01] You could probably go pretty deep with that.
[01:10:03] You can go real deep.
[01:10:04] I've covered that in the academy.
[01:10:06] How to earn leadership capital.
[01:10:09] And what costs leadership capital.
[01:10:11] So you definitely, that's good.
[01:10:14] We could do it on here at some point as well.
[01:10:18] It's surprising how much listening to people
[01:10:21] gives you leadership capital.
[01:10:22] And usually when I talk about the opposite of that
[01:10:26] is when people go, oh yeah, he's right.
[01:10:28] Cause listen, if you start telling me something
[01:10:30] and I cut you off, right?
[01:10:33] And you might not realize the weight of when you're
[01:10:36] telling me something and I listen to you.
[01:10:38] You might not.
[01:10:39] It's like a subconscious.
[01:10:40] You be some consciously giving me leadership capital.
[01:10:42] Some conscious like, oh yeah, hell yeah.
[01:10:44] But when I cut you off and you're trying to express
[01:10:47] something to me and I just cut you off.
[01:10:48] And I'm like, yeah, hey look,
[01:10:50] let's get to the topic of the day.
[01:10:51] You're just, that costs me a lot of leadership capital.
[01:10:54] Just like anything, and that's just do with respect.
[01:10:59] You know what you were talking about earlier?
[01:11:02] A crappy job.
[01:11:03] If we got something, if we gotta go pick up brass
[01:11:07] and I'm out there doing it with you,
[01:11:09] leadership capital goes up.
[01:11:10] If I'm in the air conditioning place,
[01:11:12] leadership capital goes down.
[01:11:13] So there's all these things that are going on.
[01:11:19] Bro, it gets kind of tricky too though.
[01:11:20] And maybe it's my little P brain mind going too deep
[01:11:24] into it, maybe it's not.
[01:11:26] But like, let's say you, okay,
[01:11:28] you know your story, right?
[01:11:29] The patches, right?
[01:11:31] So you let, we'll say, you let something slide, right?
[01:11:35] You let something slide, sometimes that can,
[01:11:37] under certain circumstances that can gain you,
[01:11:40] may have you gain leadership capital,
[01:11:42] but under other circumstances you can lose it.
[01:11:44] It's the same action.
[01:11:45] You let something slide.
[01:11:47] But it's like, oh, you gotta understand.
[01:11:49] That's why you wrote the dichotomy of leadership.
[01:11:51] That's why a quiz would be pretty good.
[01:11:52] And that's why leadership is tricky.
[01:11:55] It's tricky because you gotta assess that.
[01:11:57] And that's why I'm talking about this leadership loop.
[01:12:01] Because so often people aren't actually just checking them.
[01:12:04] So I was like, wait a second,
[01:12:05] I wonder how bad Echo actually wants to do this.
[01:12:06] I wonder what this is costing me.
[01:12:11] The reason that it weighs so heavily for me,
[01:12:14] first of all, it's because leadership capital
[01:12:16] is the currency of winning.
[01:12:17] If you wanna win, you gotta have a bunch of leadership
[01:12:20] capital built up.
[01:12:23] And I put so much weight on leadership capital
[01:12:28] because this is interesting thing to think about.
[01:12:32] Most of the time,
[01:12:35] one idea, it's only a little bit better
[01:12:39] than some other idea.
[01:12:41] Very rarely are you and I working at a company
[01:12:45] or in a military unit or part of a team.
[01:12:48] And your idea is so radically different from mine
[01:12:54] that I'm willing to, that I even need to think about,
[01:12:59] hey, is that a good decision or not?
[01:13:01] Usually your idea is pretty good.
[01:13:04] You're like, in your mind, you're like,
[01:13:06] hey, I wanna explode a Star Wars robots.
[01:13:09] And I think you should explode.
[01:13:12] Terminator.
[01:13:12] Terminator robots, right?
[01:13:14] Are those two things worth arguing about?
[01:13:19] No, no.
[01:13:19] Are they worth it?
[01:13:20] They're not.
[01:13:22] I think one thing, you think another thing,
[01:13:24] but the things that we're thinking
[01:13:25] are very closely related.
[01:13:26] So therefore, what trumps the idea,
[01:13:29] because the ideas are so close,
[01:13:33] what trumps the idea is leadership capital.
[01:13:34] We have a common goal.
[01:13:35] We have a common capability.
[01:13:38] We have common experiences.
[01:13:40] And we're gonna come up with pretty similar plans
[01:13:42] because we're both coming from the same place.
[01:13:44] Therefore, your plan is probably gonna be viable.
[01:13:48] And because your plan is viable,
[01:13:50] because what I said, you want Star Wars?
[01:13:53] Terminator.
[01:13:54] Okay, because you want Terminator robots
[01:13:55] and I want Star Wars robots, they're both viable.
[01:13:58] But because they're both viable,
[01:14:00] I make the expenditure of leadership capital
[01:14:03] a very heavy weighted element of my decision.
[01:14:09] Because the decision between Star Wars robots
[01:14:11] or Terminator robots isn't gonna make that much of a difference.
[01:14:14] Now, are there people that freaking dig in
[01:14:17] about what robot needs to die?
[01:14:19] Hell yeah, there are.
[01:14:20] And they're idiots for doing it.
[01:14:22] I don't care.
[01:14:25] I don't care.
[01:14:27] And the reason I don't care is
[01:14:28] because building leadership capital is the strategic move.
[01:14:32] That's the strategic move,
[01:14:34] because if we're spending leadership capital all the time,
[01:14:37] we won't have any left,
[01:14:38] or even worse, we'll end up in debt.
[01:14:40] And that's not gonna end well.
[01:14:41] Because by the way,
[01:14:42] when I don't have any leadership capital with you
[01:14:43] and I ask you to do something,
[01:14:45] you're not gonna do it.
[01:14:47] If I have a ton of leadership capital
[01:14:49] and I need you to do something,
[01:14:52] and there's no time to talk about it,
[01:14:53] and you don't believe in it,
[01:14:54] but I need to get it done,
[01:14:55] I can actually spend some of that leadership capital
[01:14:58] and we can move forward.
[01:15:00] So, that's what I'm gonna do.
[01:15:04] When I'm making a decision as to whether or not
[01:15:08] to go left or right, or use Terminator robots
[01:15:10] or Star Wars robots,
[01:15:13] I'm going to put a huge amount of weight
[01:15:15] on how much leadership capital this is going to cost me.
[01:15:19] And see and weigh whether this is,
[01:15:25] whether this is the right move or not.
[01:15:27] Most of the time, it's not.
[01:15:30] Most of the time, it's not.
[01:15:32] Leadership capital is more valuable
[01:15:36] than any other elements in the world.
[01:15:42] Leadership capital, everything that's wrapped up
[01:15:45] in leadership capital, trust, integrity, vision, unity.
[01:15:51] There's all these things that are wrapped up in it.
[01:15:54] That's what makes it so valuable.
[01:15:55] It's like this thing that has so much power.
[01:15:59] And yet people throw it away.
[01:16:01] People don't even realize how valuable it is.
[01:16:02] I'll just throw it away on this, that, or the other thing.
[01:16:04] Like, hey, you just need to get this done.
[01:16:06] Boom, I just spent freaking however many units
[01:16:09] worth of leadership capital.
[01:16:11] Dude, you just need to be quiet and get this done.
[01:16:12] Boom, I'm just throwing money away.
[01:16:14] Hey, hey, Jocko, I gotta go to,
[01:16:16] hey, look, I don't need to hear your ideas right now.
[01:16:18] We need to move forward.
[01:16:18] Okay, cool, that just cost me.
[01:16:20] It's like everything we do.
[01:16:21] People just throw it away like it's nothing.
[01:16:23] They break out the freaking, they go into debt.
[01:16:25] They go into, then they end up bankrupt.
[01:16:28] Leadership.
[01:16:28] You ever met someone that has no leadership capital left?
[01:16:31] Yes, I have.
[01:16:32] Yeah, like you work for someone that's an asshole.
[01:16:33] You work for someone that doesn't listen to anybody else.
[01:16:35] They have no leadership capital.
[01:16:36] And maybe they can make some things happen early on
[01:16:40] because they have the authority or they have the experience
[01:16:42] or they have the position.
[01:16:44] And that, they can actually make a little bit of progress
[01:16:46] and then the leadership capital's gone
[01:16:47] and everything just falls apart.
[01:16:48] Yeah, and that's like a, back,
[01:16:50] and I've said this before, so I don't need to go too deep
[01:16:53] into it, but you know how like you have an old boss
[01:16:55] that you used to work for and he was just a dick
[01:16:57] or whatever and he don't work there anymore.
[01:16:58] You work at a better job now, you know?
[01:17:00] And then maybe you see that old boss somewhere,
[01:17:03] the way you feel about him.
[01:17:05] You can see his leadership capital is at zero
[01:17:07] at that point.
[01:17:09] At zero.
[01:17:11] So that's what I'm gonna do.
[01:17:11] I'm gonna consider leadership capital
[01:17:13] and it's gonna weigh very heavily.
[01:17:16] And by the way, the reason I didn't put this
[01:17:18] on the list originally, because it was so,
[01:17:20] it was so integral to the way I think
[01:17:22] I didn't even see it there.
[01:17:23] You know what I mean?
[01:17:24] It was just one of those things.
[01:17:25] It was almost like, if I was to put down,
[01:17:27] what do you need every day, Echo?
[01:17:28] You'd be like, hey, I need a good workout.
[01:17:30] I need to get a good steak.
[01:17:33] I wanna roll a jiu-jitsu.
[01:17:35] And I'd be like, what about oxygen?
[01:17:36] What about air?
[01:17:37] You'd be like, well, yeah, obviously.
[01:17:38] That's, leadership capital for me was like breathing air.
[01:17:41] It was that integral to my day.
[01:17:42] I didn't even see it was there.
[01:17:43] Yeah.
[01:17:44] So.
[01:17:45] Yeah, now that you bring it up though,
[01:17:46] it's like, it's not like air, right?
[01:17:48] Cause it's so like people don't understand.
[01:17:51] Oh no, actually wrong.
[01:17:52] It is like air.
[01:17:53] Or it is, but they're ignoring it.
[01:17:54] So it's like that.
[01:17:55] Well, it is, but people don't realize
[01:17:56] how valuable it is they can't breathe.
[01:17:59] So they don't even realize it's there.
[01:18:00] And they're like just wasting it
[01:18:02] and it doesn't matter.
[01:18:03] It'll always be there.
[01:18:04] No, it's not.
[01:18:05] You get choked out.
[01:18:07] So what happens?
[01:18:08] Tell me you're not concerned about air
[01:18:09] when you get that guillotine choke sunk on you.
[01:18:12] I am concerned about air.
[01:18:13] Yeah, real concerned.
[01:18:14] Yes.
[01:18:15] So be careful.
[01:18:16] Tell me if you think this is an example
[01:18:18] of being in touch with leadership capital.
[01:18:23] So, you know, as you know, we have this dog now,
[01:18:25] a small dog.
[01:18:26] Never wanted a dog.
[01:18:27] I didn't want a dog.
[01:18:28] What's your dog's name?
[01:18:29] Maya.
[01:18:30] It's a small little we what do you call it?
[01:18:31] Yorkie.
[01:18:33] I think I don't know what you call it.
[01:18:33] Cause I don't have the dog.
[01:18:34] Come on, bro.
[01:18:35] You know what it's called.
[01:18:36] Anyway, one of these little small dogs, whatever.
[01:18:38] It's whatever.
[01:18:38] It's cute.
[01:18:39] I never wanted the dog.
[01:18:40] We're going to add another thing to the like simple life.
[01:18:45] All the kids want dogs.
[01:18:46] My wife, maybe, maybe she wanted the dog.
[01:18:48] Maybe not, but she hears it from the kids every day.
[01:18:51] Oh my gosh.
[01:18:52] Every time the kids see a dog.
[01:18:54] And there's people in our neighborhood,
[01:18:55] neighborhood with cool little dogs and stuff.
[01:18:57] And they're nice dogs.
[01:18:58] And so they're great examples of dogs all around
[01:19:00] constantly being reminded how they don't have a dog.
[01:19:03] Right.
[01:19:04] So finally I'm like, hey, all right.
[01:19:06] I kind of went through this loop a little bit
[01:19:08] in a small way where I'm like, hey, you know, like
[01:19:10] leadership capital at some point in there.
[01:19:11] Exactly. Right.
[01:19:12] So I'm like, all right.
[01:19:13] Now, this would be actually be an interesting thing
[01:19:16] for us to do is go through your decision to get a dog
[01:19:19] and assess your leadership loop on this thing.
[01:19:23] Right.
[01:19:24] I mean, you know, time, well, you do have plenty of time
[01:19:26] to make this decision.
[01:19:27] You didn't like rush one week and be like,
[01:19:28] okay, we need to get a dog now.
[01:19:29] I know you took time to consider it.
[01:19:31] Two years by the way.
[01:19:32] So there you go.
[01:19:33] Cover move.
[01:19:34] You were like, hey, if we don't get a dog,
[01:19:37] is that putting me first?
[01:19:39] Yes, it is.
[01:19:40] And so you kind of made that decision.
[01:19:41] Like, okay, gotta put the team first.
[01:19:43] Simple.
[01:19:44] This is one of those things where you're like,
[01:19:45] well, this is going to actually make things more complex.
[01:19:48] So you had to put that into the calculus.
[01:19:50] Right.
[01:19:51] Prioritize and execute.
[01:19:52] Well, is it one of our priorities?
[01:19:54] Well, we saw some family unity being created.
[01:20:00] And so that was a positive thing.
[01:20:01] So the priority kind of stepped up a little bit
[01:20:03] because we want the family to be tight.
[01:20:04] And yeah, and there's other elements in that too,
[01:20:06] because, you know, like, okay, so my daughter's nine.
[01:20:09] So getting a small dog too.
[01:20:11] This is like a small, it's not like some big great Dane
[01:20:13] where it's like more responsibility
[01:20:14] or whatever it's a small little dog, minimal,
[01:20:16] arguably responsibility comparatively speaking.
[01:20:19] And you have a pet that it actually is responsibility
[01:20:22] for the kid obviously being supported by us, of course,
[01:20:25] you know, but you get to learn a little bit
[01:20:27] of that responsibility, sacrifice, you know,
[01:20:30] and stuff like that.
[01:20:31] So it was a net pot as far as priorities go
[01:20:33] and the developmental elements of a kid.
[01:20:36] And let's face it, like,
[01:20:38] is it unreasonable for a kid to have a childhood pet?
[01:20:43] Is that unreasonable?
[01:20:43] No, no, it's good.
[01:20:44] And as you just mentioned, there's lessons to be learned.
[01:20:47] Exactly, right.
[01:20:47] Which goes into decentralized command.
[01:20:49] You know that is this something you can decentralize?
[01:20:51] So what did you go, oh, we're gonna get this dog
[01:20:53] and then I'm gonna have to walk it.
[01:20:54] I'm gonna have to feed it.
[01:20:55] No, you were probably like,
[01:20:56] hey, I'm not cleaning up dog shit, right?
[01:20:59] I'm not gonna be the one that feeds it every day.
[01:21:01] So you knew you could decentralize some of this stuff.
[01:21:04] So that is additionally positive here.
[01:21:08] Was it your ego that was getting in the way a little bit?
[01:21:10] Cause, hey, check it out.
[01:21:12] Let's face it, the dog is gonna take a little attention away
[01:21:15] from Echo Charles just a little bit, right?
[01:21:18] And plus you might have been like,
[01:21:19] hey, this is my house, right?
[01:21:21] You could get into that mode.
[01:21:22] And that is,
[01:21:24] I'm not saying you did, but it could be a fact.
[01:21:26] It did a little bit, maybe not necessarily
[01:21:27] in that particular way.
[01:21:28] Like this is my house and I make those, it wasn't that.
[01:21:30] It was more about like, oh yeah, everyone wants this dog,
[01:21:33] but what about what I want?
[01:21:34] It was like that.
[01:21:36] And I was like, bro, that's kind of wack.
[01:21:37] You don't want to realize that.
[01:21:39] Good, okay.
[01:21:41] Emotion.
[01:21:43] You had to at least check the emotion that you were having
[01:21:48] and that everyone else was having.
[01:21:50] Cause if you don't, you, you weighed in
[01:21:52] how happy everyone was gonna be.
[01:21:54] And that countered how like somewhat frustrated
[01:21:57] you were gonna be.
[01:21:57] You actually went through this and thought to yourself,
[01:22:00] you know what?
[01:22:01] Them being super happy outweighs me being
[01:22:04] a little bit aggravated.
[01:22:05] So you put, you did the calculus of the emotion,
[01:22:07] made the right call, mission.
[01:22:10] Does this help our mission as a family?
[01:22:12] Again, helps bring the family together.
[01:22:14] There's lessons to be learned.
[01:22:15] We have something to talk about.
[01:22:17] We have a, what's that?
[01:22:19] A common affection towards this thing.
[01:22:23] Even though this thing is small and weak
[01:22:25] and doesn't really protect us from anything,
[01:22:26] which is okay.
[01:22:27] But it gets the kids outside even more,
[01:22:30] you know, all this stuff.
[01:22:31] Leadership cap.
[01:22:32] So this is where we get to.
[01:22:33] So now you got to a point where as leadership capital,
[01:22:35] you were, and how did you calculate that
[01:22:37] on the dog purchase?
[01:22:38] Which in a small way went back to measuring the emotions
[01:22:41] and comparing them, but it was essentially that.
[01:22:43] Like people, everyone knew that I didn't want a dog.
[01:22:46] In fact, they've been knowing it for two years.
[01:22:47] I'm not the kind of person, whatever that,
[01:22:50] that's like, no, you know, like I don't complain
[01:22:53] about that kind of stuff, but they,
[01:22:54] everyone knew that I was not really into it at all.
[01:22:58] When we got it, I didn't be like, yeah, I wasn't into it,
[01:23:01] but I did it anyway for you guys.
[01:23:03] None of that kind of stuff.
[01:23:04] I was just kind of like, I was like,
[01:23:05] hey, if that's what we're doing, let's do it.
[01:23:07] And I'm so, actually I will clean up after it.
[01:23:09] Not as a priority, but I'm down for the support, 100%.
[01:23:13] So when it was time to get the dog or whatever,
[01:23:19] I was like, I basically got on board.
[01:23:21] And I figured, and I guess in terms of leadership cap,
[01:23:24] I wasn't thinking of it in terms of leadership cap at all,
[01:23:26] but I wasn't thinking of it in terms of like,
[01:23:28] hey, what would like, what's the right thing to do here?
[01:23:31] And something that would, if I get on board
[01:23:34] in a positive way, in a conducive way,
[01:23:37] that's gonna be better off for everybody.
[01:23:40] So that's just what I did.
[01:23:42] But kind of maybe, how should I say,
[01:23:45] inadvertently or whatever, just not thinking of it.
[01:23:48] I'm sure that did,
[01:23:50] because people know that I didn't want the dog,
[01:23:51] but meanwhile I have a good attitude about it.
[01:23:53] I'm still cleaning up.
[01:23:54] And let's face it, this is the classic tale, right?
[01:23:56] Where the dad doesn't want the dog,
[01:23:57] then the dad ends up being the best friend
[01:23:59] of the dog kind of a thing, you know?
[01:24:01] We're not quite there yet,
[01:24:02] but I have embraced the dog on a personal level.
[01:24:05] Teeny, tiny dog.
[01:24:07] So I feel like, if they even notice, who knows?
[01:24:12] They're little kids.
[01:24:14] I guarantee you that's the leadership capital out of this.
[01:24:16] Guaranteed.
[01:24:18] And that's good.
[01:24:19] That's good.
[01:24:20] Because over time, also, you gotta think,
[01:24:22] how much am I spending leadership capital
[01:24:24] when this is the one thing they want
[01:24:27] and I'm not getting it for them?
[01:24:28] That could be a problem.
[01:24:30] And I shouldn't even say,
[01:24:32] I probably wouldn't actually be that big of a problem.
[01:24:34] And the reason it's not that big of a problem,
[01:24:35] because it's a huge ask, right?
[01:24:37] It's a huge ask.
[01:24:38] A dog is a big deal, man.
[01:24:40] You can't just be getting a dog on a whim.
[01:24:42] You should go through this checklist
[01:24:45] before you go and invest in a dog
[01:24:47] or pick up a dog from the dog pound
[01:24:49] or whatever you're gonna do.
[01:24:51] Here's what I do have in mind consciously
[01:24:53] in regards to leadership capital.
[01:24:55] If I complain about that dog or about having the dog,
[01:24:58] not even necessarily about the dog,
[01:24:59] because you can complain about it,
[01:25:00] like, frick, the dog's barking, you know, whatever.
[01:25:02] But if I complain about having the dog,
[01:25:05] that is like, to me, it feels like I'm like,
[01:25:08] spending so much of that leadership capital
[01:25:10] because it's like, I never wanted that dog, you know?
[01:25:12] Making everyone feel guilty or something like this.
[01:25:15] Never.
[01:25:16] It's against the straight up morals.
[01:25:19] Yeah, that would be that.
[01:25:20] That's so strict, I think, that release.
[01:25:21] That would be that.
[01:25:22] So, leadership capital, put that in the calculus.
[01:25:26] It's more valuable than the air that you breathe
[01:25:29] from a leadership perspective.
[01:25:30] Now, the next thing is, as,
[01:25:33] and I've mentioned this a bunch already,
[01:25:36] but as I'm judging or assessing all these aspects
[01:25:38] of a decision, I am going to the whole time,
[01:25:41] pay attention to my own bias.
[01:25:46] You know, do I tend to think
[01:25:48] that I have too much leadership capital?
[01:25:49] Because there's people that are like that.
[01:25:50] They think, oh, hey, man, don't worry.
[01:25:52] I'm jockeling, man, people are just, no.
[01:25:55] Do I underestimate the amount
[01:25:57] of leadership capital that I have?
[01:25:59] First of all, that's rare, and it's usually not true.
[01:26:02] But those are things that I am going to do.
[01:26:06] I am going to constantly be assessing my own bias.
[01:26:09] So you might wanna throw onto your leadership loop
[01:26:12] bias assessment to make sure that you're not
[01:26:16] making a mistake because of the biases that you have.
[01:26:20] Or you can put that into each one of these topics,
[01:26:24] ego, emotion, mission, leadership capital.
[01:26:27] You can put bias into each one of those subcategories
[01:26:29] to say, you know what?
[01:26:31] I know I'm always letting my ego get in the way.
[01:26:33] Or maybe you're saying the other opposite side,
[01:26:35] you know I'm never confident enough with my decisions.
[01:26:39] On time, right?
[01:26:41] What's your bias?
[01:26:42] Do you think everything takes five minutes
[01:26:44] when it really takes a half an hour?
[01:26:46] Calculate that bias.
[01:26:49] And then the last thing I'm gonna say here
[01:26:50] is something that I like to think about.
[01:26:55] Am I looking at the symptoms
[01:26:57] or am I looking at the root cause?
[01:27:03] Because a lot of times the solution
[01:27:07] that's right in front of your face
[01:27:10] is actually a solution to a symptom.
[01:27:13] And we see this like 2D solution
[01:27:16] that's right in front of us.
[01:27:17] And it's usually obvious.
[01:27:18] And here's what's tricky, it's usually right.
[01:27:21] Usually the first, you know, if Echo's doing something
[01:27:24] or if we gotta come up with a plan
[01:27:26] and I come up with a quick plan to solve a problem,
[01:27:29] usually that first plan that we both see is a solution
[01:27:32] and it will work.
[01:27:34] But there's a good chance that we're both reacting
[01:27:37] to a symptom and not to the disease.
[01:27:40] So I like to just check myself and say
[01:27:44] is what I'm looking at the symptom?
[01:27:46] Or is it the actual root cause of the problem?
[01:27:51] And is the solution that's being proposed
[01:27:53] or the plan I'm coming up with,
[01:27:54] is it a 2D solution for something
[01:27:56] that's right in front of me?
[01:27:57] Or is it a 3D that will actually get us a long-term solution?
[01:28:03] So that's what I'm gonna look at.
[01:28:05] Now, here's what messes us up in this loop
[01:28:08] and it's pretty similar to what can mess you up
[01:28:10] in the OODA loop.
[01:28:11] Number one is you can get stuck in any one of these areas.
[01:28:14] Just like you get stuck in the OODA loop,
[01:28:16] in the OODA loop you can get stuck observing.
[01:28:18] You're just looking around, looking around,
[01:28:19] trying to see what you see.
[01:28:20] You're trying to get every angle and you get stuck there.
[01:28:23] You get stuck looking around and you get shot down.
[01:28:26] Maybe you get stuck orienting yourself.
[01:28:28] You're like, wait, hold on, where are they?
[01:28:30] Where am I?
[01:28:31] Hold on, let me see exactly where I'm in.
[01:28:32] You get shot down.
[01:28:33] Maybe you get stuck in the decision,
[01:28:35] but wait, should I go left, should I go right,
[01:28:36] should I go left, should I go right?
[01:28:37] I don't know if there's advantage,
[01:28:38] it's going left, there's advantage,
[01:28:39] going right, you get shot down.
[01:28:40] Or act, you won't take action.
[01:28:44] You don't do the action, you get shot down.
[01:28:47] So if you get stuck in any of these as well, same thing.
[01:28:50] If you get stuck thinking about any of these things,
[01:28:55] and you let it become the focus,
[01:28:57] I want to make sure my ego's not a problem.
[01:28:59] And that's what you focus on.
[01:29:00] You don't consider time, you don't consider emotion,
[01:29:02] you don't consider the mission.
[01:29:03] So you can't get stuck on any of these things.
[01:29:10] You can't get stuck.
[01:29:13] You have to let the loop continue to flow.
[01:29:16] And you know what you're gonna figure out?
[01:29:18] You're gonna figure out that there's some things
[01:29:19] that you're good at in this loop,
[01:29:20] and there's some things that you're bad at in this loop.
[01:29:22] Maybe your ego's not a problem,
[01:29:24] but you have a problem with time.
[01:29:26] Maybe your emotion isn't a problem,
[01:29:30] but you always get distracted by different missions.
[01:29:34] Maybe you cover and move really well,
[01:29:37] but you don't realize that you expend leadership capital
[01:29:39] on stuff that doesn't matter.
[01:29:42] So you want to continually observe these things,
[01:29:44] and you want to overindex on the things
[01:29:46] that you know you are weak at.
[01:29:49] So that's the number one way that we get messed up
[01:29:52] when we're making decisions.
[01:29:53] The number two things we ignore the feedback
[01:29:57] that we're getting, which is such a disaster.
[01:30:00] It's such a disaster to ignore the feedback
[01:30:05] that we're getting.
[01:30:05] And the point I made earlier about Echo Charles
[01:30:09] and how my ego is gonna lie to me,
[01:30:13] your ego is lying 100% of the time.
[01:30:16] Let me just say that.
[01:30:16] My ego is saying, actually, in this case,
[01:30:19] Jocko, look, I know I get it, but this echo really is the problem.
[01:30:24] He really is the problem.
[01:30:25] That, and when I ignore that, the fact that,
[01:30:30] I'm sorry, not that I ignore it,
[01:30:31] but I let my ego convince me that, you know what,
[01:30:34] this time, just this one time, my ego's right.
[01:30:36] It's not.
[01:30:37] Or just this one time, hey, this is an emotional decision.
[01:30:40] It's the right thing to do.
[01:30:41] Jocko said, you need to put emotions into calculus,
[01:30:43] and I'm pissed, so we're gonna do it.
[01:30:45] No.
[01:30:45] We ignore feedback, and of course,
[01:30:51] this comes from a lack of humility.
[01:30:54] When you're being told something, even in your own head,
[01:30:57] but you ignore it, like, you know,
[01:31:00] I know Echo might kinda get screwed by this decision,
[01:31:02] but you know, he's not gonna notice, boom.
[01:31:05] You're just lying to yourself.
[01:31:06] You're ignoring the feedback, and that's gonna cost you.
[01:31:09] And so in order to do that, this comes back
[01:31:12] to a fundamental skill of leadership
[01:31:16] that I wrote about in leadership strategy and tactics,
[01:31:18] and that is the ability to take a step back and detach.
[01:31:20] That's the only way you're gonna see this stuff.
[01:31:22] You can't, detachment is a superpower,
[01:31:24] and the reason that detachment is a superpower
[01:31:27] is because the solution to the problem
[01:31:29] is not in the problem.
[01:31:33] The solution to the problem will not be found
[01:31:36] inside the problem.
[01:31:37] You gotta step outside the problem
[01:31:39] in order to see the solution.
[01:31:41] Don't get wrapped up in the problem itself.
[01:31:45] Instead, take a step back, run through this loop
[01:31:50] so you can make better decisions.
[01:31:53] And what is an important thing to recognize?
[01:31:57] You might be thinking like, oh, well, I'm not, you know,
[01:31:59] the CEO of some big company,
[01:32:00] and I don't need me to make a bunch of decisions.
[01:32:02] Guess what?
[01:32:03] Life is a series of decisions all day, every day.
[01:32:08] That's what life is.
[01:32:09] Everything that you do is a decision.
[01:32:13] It's almost like the binary decision,
[01:32:17] which I wrote about in Discipline and Freedom's Manual.
[01:32:20] Everything that you do is a decision.
[01:32:21] They're not always necessarily binary,
[01:32:23] but when you live life, you're making decisions.
[01:32:25] Everything you do is a decision.
[01:32:29] So because everything you do is a decision,
[01:32:31] once you realize that, you should detach,
[01:32:33] and you should have a protocol for making decisions
[01:32:37] because then your decisions will be better.
[01:32:40] And you should have the humility to realize
[01:32:42] when you aren't making good decisions,
[01:32:44] and when you get that feedback and realize,
[01:32:46] oh, I gotta make some different decisions now.
[01:32:49] And then you make adjustments,
[01:32:50] and you make better decisions, and you move on.
[01:32:54] But, and what's beautiful about this is it means
[01:33:00] that if everything in your life
[01:33:01] is based on the decisions you're making, guess what?
[01:33:05] You have a lot of control over your life
[01:33:10] based on the decisions that you make.
[01:33:14] So make good decisions.
[01:33:16] It's gonna make you a better person.
[01:33:18] It's gonna make you a better leader.
[01:33:19] It's gonna give you a better life.
[01:33:23] All right, there you go.
[01:33:25] Echo Charles.
[01:33:25] Yes sir.
[01:33:27] Speaking of good decisions,
[01:33:28] I know there's some ways that people could decide
[01:33:30] to support themselves a little bit better.
[01:33:32] Yeah, it's true.
[01:33:34] And they could support this podcast while they're doing it.
[01:33:36] It's true.
[01:33:36] They could support America while they're doing it.
[01:33:38] Very true, yeah.
[01:33:39] Which is kind of a big deal.
[01:33:41] Especially considering how tenuous the world is right now.
[01:33:43] World's a tenuous place.
[01:33:44] Sure.
[01:33:45] There's other elements out there making a move.
[01:33:49] Got China making a move.
[01:33:50] They're out there making a move.
[01:33:52] They're trying to take the rushes out there.
[01:33:53] They're making a move.
[01:33:54] People are stepping up.
[01:33:56] Moves are being made.
[01:33:57] Moves are being made.
[01:33:58] And are we gonna sit back?
[01:34:01] Now, does this mean you need to pick up a rifle
[01:34:02] and go to war?
[01:34:03] No.
[01:34:04] But I'll tell you what you can do.
[01:34:05] You can support America.
[01:34:08] I know a good way to do that.
[01:34:09] Yeah, me too.
[01:34:11] Well, it starts with ourselves, right?
[01:34:13] I think a lot of the time.
[01:34:14] Do you talk about good decisions where,
[01:34:17] look, other people not making decisions for you
[01:34:20] unless you're letting them.
[01:34:21] But you wanna make good decisions for yourself, right?
[01:34:24] I would imagine.
[01:34:25] So it starts with yourself.
[01:34:26] We're taking care of ourselves physically, mentally.
[01:34:31] Mentally.
[01:34:33] Deciding to.
[01:34:34] That's what we're doing.
[01:34:35] It's true.
[01:34:36] So we're working out, of course.
[01:34:38] 100%.
[01:34:39] We're reading.
[01:34:40] I know that.
[01:34:41] Yes, we are.
[01:34:42] We should be.
[01:34:43] At the very least listening.
[01:34:43] Wait, are you reading?
[01:34:44] I'm reading here and there.
[01:34:45] Bro, I don't know about this.
[01:34:47] Wait a second here.
[01:34:48] What are you reading?
[01:34:50] Well, there was, okay, so there's a book.
[01:34:52] You can't reference mind games
[01:34:54] which you read nine years ago.
[01:34:56] Yeah, probably not.
[01:34:57] I think that may be the only book you've ever referenced
[01:35:00] since I've known you.
[01:35:01] Oh, I don't know.
[01:35:02] I've read plenty of books.
[01:35:02] Okay, what do we got?
[01:35:03] What's on the docket?
[01:35:04] Echo Charles.
[01:35:05] Most of the time I'm gonna tell you what's currently
[01:35:06] on the docket, because it'd have to, you know.
[01:35:08] But.
[01:35:09] Wait a second, bro.
[01:35:11] You can be honest.
[01:35:12] We're telling each other the truth.
[01:35:13] This is like leadership, you know,
[01:35:15] a capital we're trying to build.
[01:35:17] If you're not gonna tell me like,
[01:35:18] oh, no, no, right now I'm not reading anything,
[01:35:20] Jock, because you know, it's summertime
[01:35:21] and I was in Hawaii.
[01:35:22] And so we're not reading anything unless you are.
[01:35:24] Yes.
[01:35:25] So.
[01:35:26] So what are we reading right now?
[01:35:27] Nothing or this book?
[01:35:28] So depends, because that's a spectrum.
[01:35:30] Right?
[01:35:31] Right.
[01:35:32] Bro.
[01:35:32] Bro.
[01:35:33] You should own this a hundred percent right now.
[01:35:36] Otherwise it's not gonna look right.
[01:35:37] Here's a hundred percent truth on the matter.
[01:35:40] So I have Kindle books and audio books, like,
[01:35:44] you know, some are halfway done,
[01:35:45] some are all done, some are whatever.
[01:35:47] So when, how much time has to be elapsed
[01:35:51] between the last time I was into one of these books,
[01:35:53] actually like reading it or listening to it to now,
[01:35:57] how much time has to pass before I'm technically not reading?
[01:36:01] Let's just say a week.
[01:36:03] Okay.
[01:36:04] We might not be reading.
[01:36:06] No.
[01:36:08] But.
[01:36:09] All right.
[01:36:10] That being said.
[01:36:11] That's kind of a bummer.
[01:36:12] That means that the books that you're reading
[01:36:13] or even listening to must not be that captivating.
[01:36:16] Or, well, yeah, I mean,
[01:36:18] I guess in a manner of speaking technically, yeah,
[01:36:20] but that doesn't mean that they're not captivating.
[01:36:23] That might mean that other things that I'm doing.
[01:36:25] They're competing with life.
[01:36:26] And life is captivating, which is a good thing.
[01:36:30] Yes, sir.
[01:36:31] Right?
[01:36:31] I never thought of that comeback.
[01:36:32] You know, some people are like,
[01:36:33] I'm reading three books a week.
[01:36:35] Be like, oh, that's cool.
[01:36:37] I'm actually living.
[01:36:38] Yeah.
[01:36:39] Right?
[01:36:40] That could be a little bit of a dichotomy.
[01:36:41] Could be, yes.
[01:36:42] And obviously that's going to depend
[01:36:43] because reading three books a week,
[01:36:45] one, we don't know how fast they read or listen
[01:36:47] or whatever or what they're doing.
[01:36:48] You know, what if they're going out miles, runs,
[01:36:50] we're doing the same thing.
[01:36:51] You know, it's kind of a, you know,
[01:36:52] so it can be an awesome,
[01:36:53] it can be kind of what you're alluding to
[01:36:55] where it's like cool.
[01:36:56] Flexing, no.
[01:36:57] That's fine.
[01:36:59] Oh wait, flexing with the, I'm reading.
[01:37:01] That's just a flex.
[01:37:02] Like, like a fourth book I've read this month.
[01:37:07] Right, right.
[01:37:08] Just to sort of brag and make like, yeah.
[01:37:10] Well, you know, there are many variations of flexing.
[01:37:14] Cause it'd be an interesting reflex.
[01:37:16] We'll be like, I don't have time to read books.
[01:37:19] Yeah.
[01:37:20] Or that could be an excuse.
[01:37:22] It could be an excuse.
[01:37:22] Yeah, so it just depends.
[01:37:23] It's a dichotomy.
[01:37:24] Okay, so where is Echo Charles at?
[01:37:26] In this spectrum that we were considering.
[01:37:28] The last book that I finished,
[01:37:29] which was recently, I don't know, whatever,
[01:37:32] a few months, actually I read it twice.
[01:37:33] So it was the four agreements recommended by Jason Gardner.
[01:37:38] Yeah, that's a good one.
[01:37:39] And you guys, I heard you guys talking about it
[01:37:41] and you seemed both, you know,
[01:37:43] you were both concurred that it was good.
[01:37:45] Yeah.
[01:37:46] And a lot of times that type of book,
[01:37:48] and I mean, this type, that type of book
[01:37:49] in this particular way is, it's real like,
[01:37:52] like it has a lot of spiritual like terms, you know?
[01:37:56] But, and you know, usually spiritual terms are real.
[01:38:00] Like they land on different people in different ways.
[01:38:03] Okay, I'm not tracking spiritual term.
[01:38:05] I.e. what?
[01:38:06] What's the spiritual term?
[01:38:07] Like, you know, calling things black magic
[01:38:09] or cause he'll use that term a lot.
[01:38:11] Yeah, but he's using those terms
[01:38:14] cause I heard you guys talking about it.
[01:38:15] And I think I might've even been talking
[01:38:17] to you a little bit about it or Jason,
[01:38:19] those are just like an analogy.
[01:38:21] Like this type of attitude is black magic.
[01:38:24] That's negative.
[01:38:24] Yes.
[01:38:25] So I took it in that way.
[01:38:26] Okay.
[01:38:27] Like, this is an analogy.
[01:38:28] It's not like he was saying his literal black magic.
[01:38:30] Yeah.
[01:38:30] And every once in a while it kind of felt like that.
[01:38:33] But either way, I never took it as that.
[01:38:36] Like to me, that's not the useful part of it.
[01:38:38] The useful part is many other things,
[01:38:39] but anytime they say something like black magic,
[01:38:41] I know what he's saying.
[01:38:42] I know what you mean.
[01:38:44] I think I do anyway.
[01:38:45] I believe I do.
[01:38:46] So I just, I put it that way.
[01:38:47] I took it in that way.
[01:38:49] But yeah.
[01:38:51] So that being said, the spiritual parts,
[01:38:53] even with those spiritual parts or whatever,
[01:38:55] like what he was saying with all the four agreements
[01:38:57] is like very, it's a good one.
[01:38:59] It's a good one.
[01:39:00] And a lot of it might not come as like a surprise.
[01:39:03] Like, oh man, I totally didn't know that.
[01:39:05] But just like a lot of books about like ways to think
[01:39:09] and regard yourself and the world and stuff.
[01:39:10] It's like, oh, okay, that makes sense.
[01:39:13] Or that's a good reminder.
[01:39:14] You know.
[01:39:15] It's kind of like what we just covered.
[01:39:16] There's a lot of people that are like,
[01:39:17] of course you should consider if you're screwing over your
[01:39:20] buddy.
[01:39:21] Yep.
[01:39:21] And it seems obvious.
[01:39:23] But there's times that people do this aware, unaware.
[01:39:28] And I think the big warning there is like,
[01:39:29] you think no one notices everybody else.
[01:39:31] So yeah.
[01:39:32] Some things can be, actually,
[01:39:35] I think when something seems obvious,
[01:39:36] usually that's affirming to like,
[01:39:38] this has got to be, this is pretty true.
[01:39:41] Because I know I felt this way.
[01:39:42] And now I'm seeing this guy felt this way.
[01:39:44] And now, you know, so it becomes like a thing.
[01:39:46] Yeah.
[01:39:47] And sometimes it just puts certain things,
[01:39:49] certain elements into perspective
[01:39:51] that you might not have realized how important they are
[01:39:54] or how prevalent they are in day to day, you know, stuff.
[01:39:56] Awareness.
[01:39:58] When you're aware of things, you become,
[01:40:00] just awareness is a huge step up in understanding
[01:40:05] and reacting properly.
[01:40:08] And interacting properly with the world.
[01:40:10] Like the idea that you actually brought up a few times today,
[01:40:13] the idea that like people notice.
[01:40:15] Like, I see what you're doing or I see
[01:40:17] whether it be your intention
[01:40:18] or when they're getting screwed over, whatever.
[01:40:20] Like the idea that people can see what's going on,
[01:40:24] I think that's one of the many things that's like,
[01:40:28] it helps to understand how big of a thing that is.
[01:40:31] Like, you know how it's like,
[01:40:32] yeah, sometimes they'll notice, sometimes they won't.
[01:40:33] It kind of feels like that sometimes.
[01:40:35] They notice.
[01:40:36] Oh yeah, people know it.
[01:40:37] Like, you know how, and I've said this before,
[01:40:39] I got it from Sam Harris where it's like,
[01:40:41] when you name drop someone,
[01:40:42] it's like, everyone sees you name drop it.
[01:40:44] And it's not even like a noble thing.
[01:40:46] You mean when you talk about it,
[01:40:47] I got this from Sam Harris?
[01:40:48] Oh yeah.
[01:40:49] After we hung out this one day, it was awesome.
[01:40:52] But that's like, one of the many examples of,
[01:40:56] sure maybe somebody caught it,
[01:40:58] but I'm sure it was effective when I did.
[01:41:01] But everyone noticed the same way
[01:41:03] you'll notice when someone else does it.
[01:41:05] It's kind of one of those things.
[01:41:07] But, and there's a lot of things like that.
[01:41:09] You know, so yeah, I think that book overall
[01:41:12] was a lot of that.
[01:41:14] But some stuff was like,
[01:41:15] oh, that is a good way to look at things, you know?
[01:41:18] And sometimes when somebody's written something out
[01:41:20] and they've explained it, it clarifies it for you.
[01:41:23] It increases your understanding
[01:41:25] and the better understanding you have,
[01:41:27] then the more you can interact with that properly,
[01:41:30] you can utilize that as a tool.
[01:41:32] That's good stuff.
[01:41:33] So yeah, we wanna read.
[01:41:36] Very unvarying levels, you know?
[01:41:38] Yeah, if you start reading one book a week over here,
[01:41:41] you're gonna be like, that's good.
[01:41:43] That's good.
[01:41:44] If you're reading one book a week, that's good, man.
[01:41:46] It's hard to say that that's bad.
[01:41:48] Yeah, I don't actually know if I've,
[01:41:51] there was a while where I was reading one book every week
[01:41:53] when we were doing the podcast
[01:41:54] and it was like almost all books.
[01:41:57] And then it seemed like we went a little,
[01:41:59] a bunch of people were coming on for interviews.
[01:42:02] So that was a little bit more interview-centric.
[01:42:05] So, but I, this I can say,
[01:42:08] there is no period of time of more than two days
[01:42:12] where I haven't read something.
[01:42:13] Oh, damn.
[01:42:14] Yeah, so that's kind of where I'm at.
[01:42:16] But that's not a flex, bro, because guess what?
[01:42:18] Maybe I should be surfing or getting in fights at REI.
[01:42:24] Sure, hell yeah, parking lot fights.
[01:42:26] I'll just explain the situation.
[01:42:28] But we are working out every day.
[01:42:29] You know Joel Tudor, yeah, you know.
[01:42:30] Of course.
[01:42:31] Joel Tudor, he, if you don't know,
[01:42:34] he's surfer and a Jiu-Jitsu guy, awesome guy.
[01:42:37] But he like posted something,
[01:42:39] something about like basically kook surfers.
[01:42:42] Like, you know, surfer Starter Kit,
[01:42:45] Malibu surfer starter kit.
[01:42:47] And one of the pictures was like a sprinter.
[01:42:49] I responded on his post.
[01:42:50] I was like, hey bro, I got a sprinter.
[01:42:53] Yeah, yeah.
[01:42:54] So, sorry Joel.
[01:42:55] Sorry Joel, I got a sprinter.
[01:42:57] There, people.
[01:42:57] Well, so it was kind of a confirmation, really.
[01:42:59] You know, small way.
[01:43:01] Oh, they just called me a kook, huh?
[01:43:03] That's messed up.
[01:43:05] I was up on the horses and I asked the guys,
[01:43:08] the actual cowboys, I said, hey, I said, hey,
[01:43:11] in surfing, if you don't know how to surf,
[01:43:14] but you have a surfboard and you're paddling out,
[01:43:15] but you have no idea what you're doing,
[01:43:17] then you're a kook.
[01:43:19] I said, what's that called on horseback riding?
[01:43:22] And, cause that's me, cause I don't know how to ride a horse.
[01:43:25] And they said, it's a dude.
[01:43:29] So there's a thing called a dude ranch,
[01:43:31] which is basically for city slickers to go out
[01:43:34] and like be a cowboy for a little while.
[01:43:37] Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:43:38] And so, if you're one of those people, then you are a dude.
[01:43:42] That's weird, I've heard of dude ranch.
[01:43:43] There was another word that they told me as well,
[01:43:46] but I can't remember it.
[01:43:47] Yeah.
[01:43:48] It's funny.
[01:43:49] But I was one of those, I am one of those on a horse.
[01:43:51] You're a dude?
[01:43:52] Yeah.
[01:43:53] That's funny, there was a show called Hey Dude,
[01:43:56] and it was about a dude ranch and it was,
[01:43:58] I think it was on Nickelodeon too or something.
[01:44:00] Back in the day.
[01:44:00] Back in the day.
[01:44:02] Well, hey man, learn something new every day.
[01:44:03] See, sometimes you don't even have to read.
[01:44:04] You just come listen to Jocko, being a dude,
[01:44:07] or Kuk, or whatever you're being over there.
[01:44:10] But we are working out every day.
[01:44:11] Yes.
[01:44:13] Yes.
[01:44:14] Like currently working out.
[01:44:16] Like you're-
[01:44:17] You can make that claim.
[01:44:18] You don't have to sort of put explanations around that claim.
[01:44:24] Bro, your face was so guilty when you said you read.
[01:44:26] I was like, dude, please don't lie.
[01:44:28] Well, I was trying to do the calculus
[01:44:31] because that's a legitimate question.
[01:44:32] Because if you say, oh, I'm working out, right?
[01:44:34] But you haven't worked out in two weeks,
[01:44:35] you're like, bro, you're not working out.
[01:44:37] You're currently not working out actually.
[01:44:39] But if it's been like two days, that's like, okay,
[01:44:41] you could have just been coming off a rest weekend
[01:44:43] or something like this and you're still on the program,
[01:44:45] so you're saying, we're working out.
[01:44:46] So with reading, how is that?
[01:44:48] I never thought about it.
[01:44:49] So look, if I read last night before I went to bed
[01:44:52] or something, easy, right?
[01:44:54] I know the answer.
[01:44:55] Oh, I'm reading this last night.
[01:44:56] I was reading this, but let's face it.
[01:44:57] It's been three weeks.
[01:44:58] It's been three weeks.
[01:45:00] So that was the guiltiness.
[01:45:02] And three weeks is kind of a gift, isn't it?
[01:45:04] Yeah.
[01:45:05] Huh?
[01:45:06] It, yeah, yeah.
[01:45:07] I'm gonna agree with you.
[01:45:08] It's kind of a gift.
[01:45:09] Yeah.
[01:45:10] I'm giving you the opportunity to tell the truth.
[01:45:12] Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean three weeks is a gift?
[01:45:13] I'm saying me saying, oh, you were reading three weeks ago,
[01:45:16] you were reading.
[01:45:17] Oh, yeah, yeah, me.
[01:45:17] It's kind of me being not generous.
[01:45:19] Yeah, technically, I don't know.
[01:45:20] I've never done the math and the technical evaluation,
[01:45:24] but if you compare it to working out.
[01:45:25] I hope you never get interrogated.
[01:45:26] I know, right?
[01:45:27] Me too.
[01:45:28] I know.
[01:45:30] If you compare it to working out,
[01:45:31] then no, I'm not reading.
[01:45:32] Currently not reading.
[01:45:33] But here's the thing too though.
[01:45:35] Did you already lift today?
[01:45:36] No, not yet.
[01:45:37] This afternoon?
[01:45:38] Squats today, by the way.
[01:45:39] Okay.
[01:45:41] Either way.
[01:45:41] You got that mental prep going.
[01:45:42] Yeah, a little bit.
[01:45:45] But here's the thing about reading versus working out.
[01:45:46] You can pick up a book for like 10 minutes.
[01:45:49] You can read three pages.
[01:45:51] Working out, if I go do one, two sets of curls,
[01:45:54] is that a workout?
[01:45:55] I know it's BTN.
[01:45:56] I know, I know.
[01:45:57] BTN is better than nothing.
[01:46:00] Which is a non-philosophy in my opinion.
[01:46:01] But, it's just my opinion.
[01:46:04] How about this?
[01:46:05] We'll use that philosophy very sparingly.
[01:46:06] How about that?
[01:46:07] All right.
[01:46:08] But you see what I'm saying though.
[01:46:10] Yes, you can read a short amount
[01:46:12] and it still is providing legitimate benefits
[01:46:16] and progress.
[01:46:17] Whereas two sets of curls,
[01:46:20] while it is BTN, if you believe in that philosophy,
[01:46:23] which Echo doesn't,
[01:46:25] I would say, it truly is BTN.
[01:46:27] It is better than nothing.
[01:46:28] Yeah, but if I go two sets of curls
[01:46:30] and then now I say,
[01:46:31] you know what, that's gonna be my workout routine.
[01:46:33] After about two months, it's kind of like an N.
[01:46:37] Nothing.
[01:46:39] I'm not speaking.
[01:46:40] So, okay, look.
[01:46:42] We got to the bottom of it.
[01:46:43] Thank you, Jaco, for your input.
[01:46:45] We're hopefully reading.
[01:46:47] We're hopefully working out.
[01:46:48] We're hopefully improving ourselves
[01:46:49] so we can deal with the world
[01:46:51] in a better way to make better decisions.
[01:46:52] Right.
[01:46:53] So get some JacoFuel.
[01:46:54] Get yourself some more.
[01:46:55] Get yourself some, hey,
[01:46:57] this is, of all the things we're gonna say about JacoFuel,
[01:47:01] the flavors of the Discipline Go drinks
[01:47:05] have been radically upgraded.
[01:47:10] They were based on my taste buds before.
[01:47:13] My taste buds are not normal.
[01:47:15] My taste buds weren't appropriate
[01:47:17] to judge the taste of a drink for the world.
[01:47:19] I had to run that through the leadership decision loop
[01:47:24] and say, wait, my perspective on this is not correct.
[01:47:30] Other people have a more,
[01:47:33] a better palette for the job.
[01:47:35] And we also want something that's more universally loved.
[01:47:39] So we redid all the flavors.
[01:47:42] All the flavors are now awesome.
[01:47:43] You may have had one flavor that you really liked before
[01:47:46] and you might have had two that you just like,
[01:47:47] these are gross.
[01:47:48] They weren't down for you.
[01:47:49] Now you will at least like all the flavors.
[01:47:54] And there will be three and maybe five of them that you love.
[01:47:59] Yeah, I would say that's probably true.
[01:48:00] Totally redid them all.
[01:48:02] They taste delicious.
[01:48:04] If you tried them when they were based on my palette,
[01:48:07] I apologize.
[01:48:09] I'm taking ownership of the fact that
[01:48:11] I had a very sensitive palette to sweetness
[01:48:14] and a little bit of sweetness
[01:48:15] that tasted like sugarcane in my mouth.
[01:48:18] And that wasn't the truth.
[01:48:20] Besides this, you just drink water though,
[01:48:23] pre-deme for the most part.
[01:48:23] That's what I'm saying.
[01:48:24] That's why my palette was so jacked.
[01:48:26] And recently I got on the water train.
[01:48:28] So the only thing that I drink is water.
[01:48:33] Every once in a while, I'll have like a moke shake.
[01:48:36] Actually I have that more, but even now,
[01:48:39] everything is way sweeter.
[01:48:41] Everything.
[01:48:41] If you just drink water.
[01:48:43] Before I have an occasional Gatorade here,
[01:48:45] maybe some, you know, the kids got some orange juice.
[01:48:47] Well, that's a good example too.
[01:48:49] Mango, I didn't like your mango flavor of Discipline Go.
[01:48:56] Mango mayhem.
[01:48:57] And now it tastes really good.
[01:48:59] It's still not my favorite of the group,
[01:49:02] but I will definitely enjoy drinking it.
[01:49:05] So we're good.
[01:49:06] Yeah, I feel like we're good too.
[01:49:08] So there you go.
[01:49:08] Get out here and get you some of that.
[01:49:11] Also, we got the Hunt Gear coming.
[01:49:14] OriginUSA.com.
[01:49:16] Get yourself some American made Hunt Gear.
[01:49:18] And listen, that's just what we have to do
[01:49:21] in the world right now.
[01:49:22] Like I said, there's people that are stepping up.
[01:49:24] People that are not good.
[01:49:25] And they're stepping up.
[01:49:26] And they're trying to take over.
[01:49:28] And you don't need to necessarily pick up a rifle
[01:49:31] to go to war.
[01:49:33] But right now it's an economic war.
[01:49:35] And if you pick up some OriginUSA gear,
[01:49:38] it's gonna help us win the war.
[01:49:40] So we don't have to fight a war.
[01:49:42] That's the goal.
[01:49:43] Let's be economically strong.
[01:49:45] So go to OriginUSA.com, get a G.
[01:49:47] Cause you should be trained in just in case
[01:49:49] the war does come.
[01:49:51] Get some Hunt Gear.
[01:49:53] Just in case the war does come.
[01:49:55] You can hunt the enemy.
[01:49:57] But in the meantime, you can hunt deer, elk,
[01:50:00] whatever else it is you wanna hunt.
[01:50:02] Get yourself some of that.
[01:50:04] Also, we have a store.
[01:50:05] Don't we have a store?
[01:50:06] We do.
[01:50:06] Okay.
[01:50:07] What's that all about?
[01:50:08] It's called Jaco Store.
[01:50:09] You wanna represent, well, we're improving ourselves,
[01:50:12] making good decisions.
[01:50:13] You wanna represent discipline equals freedom.
[01:50:16] Which is kind of the overarching kind of thing
[01:50:19] for this whole thing.
[01:50:20] More discipline, you are the more freedom you are.
[01:50:22] Anyway, you wanna represent, we got some cool shirts
[01:50:24] and hats and hoodies and whatnot, some merch.
[01:50:26] But it's better than just merch though, by the way.
[01:50:29] A lot of thought and effort and careful,
[01:50:32] meticulous consideration has been put
[01:50:36] into all of these elements.
[01:50:37] You should put that into every package that you send out.
[01:50:41] Just let everybody know that careful time,
[01:50:44] consideration has been put into this.
[01:50:46] Oh yeah.
[01:50:47] But and it's true.
[01:50:48] There are many people, I wanna say many,
[01:50:50] I mean for accountless people that have said these,
[01:50:53] like this called the shirts and stuff like,
[01:50:55] it's my favorite shirt.
[01:50:57] What's the new shirt that you have on right now?
[01:50:59] This is called the standard issue, right?
[01:51:01] This one equals freedom, standard issue.
[01:51:03] So it's a new one.
[01:51:05] And there's multiple color ways.
[01:51:08] Color ways, yeah.
[01:51:09] You might recognize the colors and what they represent.
[01:51:13] But if you don't, that's fine.
[01:51:14] There's a kinda layer there.
[01:51:15] Yes, sir.
[01:51:15] People need to figure out what the layers mean.
[01:51:17] Yep, simple, but maybe not easy.
[01:51:19] Kind of a thing.
[01:51:20] I actually didn't figure out, you guys told me.
[01:51:21] I may have figured out, if I would have
[01:51:23] maybe seen them all at the same time
[01:51:25] and done a consideration, I might have figured it out.
[01:51:27] But I didn't figure out, but also I looked at them
[01:51:29] for like three seconds, I was like,
[01:51:30] oh, you tell me, I'm freaking out.
[01:51:31] Well, when you looked at the one,
[01:51:32] you were like, that's what that is.
[01:51:34] And then all you had to do is apply
[01:51:35] that same thinking to all of them.
[01:51:37] You'd be like, I see what's going on here.
[01:51:38] But yeah, but either way, layers there for sure.
[01:51:41] But if you don't know, layers doesn't even matter.
[01:51:43] You just choose the color that you like or the colors.
[01:51:45] And then if you do understand the layers,
[01:51:47] then it kinda matters too.
[01:51:48] Yes, sir.
[01:51:49] Doesn't matter if you don't get them,
[01:51:50] but if you get them, it kinda does matter.
[01:51:52] Yeah, it does.
[01:51:52] Let's face it, because if you listen, you know.
[01:51:54] You know.
[01:51:56] This is the way I see it.
[01:51:57] This one is kinda like this, why we call it standard issue.
[01:52:00] It's kinda like the main one we're positioning as,
[01:52:04] kinda the main discipline equals freedom.
[01:52:06] The standard, if you have this one,
[01:52:07] you're, that's the standard.
[01:52:09] You have the standard issue.
[01:52:10] Yeah.
[01:52:11] Like if you don't have it, like,
[01:52:13] are you even in the game or what?
[01:52:15] I'm not saying you're not, but you see what I'm saying.
[01:52:17] Here's the question.
[01:52:18] You don't have the standard issues, what I'm saying.
[01:52:21] All right, there you go.
[01:52:22] So yeah, jockhostort.com.
[01:52:23] We also have the short locker.

[01:52:29] New different designs.
[01:52:30] Little bit more creative, I would say.
[01:52:33] Those are pretty good ones coming out.
[01:52:35] Yeah, you gave me a brief on the one that's coming out.
[01:52:38] Yeah.
[01:52:39] I'll say it's affirmative.
[01:52:40] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:52:41] It's a good one.
[01:52:42] Is that next, when's that, how far out is that?

[01:53:37] Only Cry for the Living by Holly.
[01:53:39] Holly McKay, that's a jockal publishing.
[01:53:42] She wrote that book.
[01:53:43] She risked her life to go write that book.
[01:53:46] So she's been on the podcast.
[01:53:48] The book is insane to read and it will teach you
[01:53:52] about the world and about evil in the world.
[01:53:55] So check that out.
[01:53:56] We also have Echelon Front, Leadership Consultancy.

[01:54:14] things like EF Battlefield, just come and check those.
[01:54:18] The next EF Battlefield is sold out,
[01:54:20] but it's that little big horn looking forward to that.
[01:54:23] I think the next muster is in Atlanta,
[01:54:25] Hot Lanna, October 12th to the 14th.
[01:54:29] We sell out everything, so if you wanna come,
[01:54:31] get there quick.
[01:54:32] And also we have the online training academy.
[01:54:34] I mentioned that a couple times today.
[01:54:37] Teaching people how to lead in their life.
[01:54:41] And a lot of times people think,
[01:54:42] oh, I don't need to learn how to lead.
[01:54:44] I'm only in charge of three people.
[01:54:46] Or I don't even know how to lead
[01:54:47] because I'm not even in charge of anyone.
[01:54:50] Guess what?
[01:54:51] You are in charge of someone.
[01:54:51] You're making decisions all the time.
[01:54:54] You have a family.
[01:54:55] You have peers that you need to lead.
[01:54:57] You have to lead your boss.
[01:54:58] I know that seems crazy.
[01:55:01] So go to extrememownership.com.
[01:55:04] If you want to get in on that online training.
[01:55:09] Part of the reason we built that
[01:55:10] is to make it more accessible to more people.
[01:55:12] That's the mission of Eshalon Front,
[01:55:14] to pass on the leadership lessons we learned.
[01:55:16] And the Eshalon Front team can't get to everybody.
[01:55:22] But now we can, extrememownership.com.
[01:55:24] Go and check it out.
[01:55:25] And if you want to help service members
[01:55:26] act and retired, you want to help their families.
[01:55:28] You want to help Gold Star families.
[01:55:29] Check out Mark Lee's mom.
[01:55:31] Mom and Lee, she's got an incredible charity organization
[01:55:34] where she provides most of what she does.
[01:55:37] She does a bunch of things.
[01:55:39] I would say that the best thing that she does,
[01:55:41] well, I don't say the best thing.
[01:55:43] How can I say this?
[01:55:45] One of the most impactful things that she does,
[01:55:48] and she does a lot of impactful things,
[01:55:49] is she provides medical help for veterans
[01:55:55] that is not provided for by the veterans administration.
[01:56:00] So Hyperbaric Chamber is one of the primary things
[01:56:03] she does to take someone that's having issues
[01:56:06] and pay for them to go to a location
[01:56:09] where they have a Hyperbaric Chamber,
[01:56:11] put them on the right nutrition,
[01:56:13] give them the right vitamins, get their health squared away
[01:56:17] for 30 days, everything's paid for.
[01:56:20] 30 days of recovery from the impact of combat and trauma.
[01:56:26] That's one of the things that she does.
[01:56:28] So that's at americasmightywarriors.org.
[01:56:33] So check that one out.
[01:56:34] And then of course, I was talking about being on a horse today
[01:56:38] and I'm a dude, meaning I'm not skilled,
[01:56:41] but you can, when you're out there in the wilderness
[01:56:46] and you're interacting with an animal
[01:56:48] and you're in the open air,
[01:56:51] it's a very positive thing
[01:56:55] for your mental and physical health.
[01:56:57] So Micah Fink, he has this thing called Heroes and Horses
[01:57:01] at heroesandhorses.org.
[01:57:03] He takes veterans into the wilderness for 41 days
[01:57:08] and it's horseback, it's camping,
[01:57:12] it's staying out on the trail
[01:57:14] and guys are coming back renewed
[01:57:18] and reanimated for life.
[01:57:20] So check out heroesandhorses.org.
[01:57:22] He's been on the podcast.
[01:57:24] I'm sure we'll get him back on here again at some point,
[01:57:26] but he's got a great charity as does Mama Lee.
[01:57:28] So check those things out if you wanna support.
[01:57:30] And if you wanna check in with us,
[01:57:32] we're on social media, on Twitter, on the gram, on Facebook.
[01:57:36] Echo's at Echo Charles.
[01:57:37] I'm at Jocko'Winling.
[01:57:38] Listen, and if you're gonna go on there,
[01:57:39] all I'm saying is be careful
[01:57:41] because there's an algorithm that's looking to grab you
[01:57:43] by the throat.
[01:57:44] Don't let it be ready for it.
[01:57:47] Don't let it run your life, get off your phone.
[01:57:50] And of course, to all those military folks out there
[01:57:54] in the world that are making decisions every day
[01:57:58] that provide us freedom and security.
[01:58:00] Thank you for what you do.
[01:58:03] And also thanks to police and law enforcement
[01:58:06] and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs
[01:58:08] and dispatchers and correctional officers
[01:58:09] and border patrol and secret service
[01:58:11] and all the first responders.
[01:58:13] Thank you for protecting our freedom and security
[01:58:17] here at home.
[01:58:19] And everyone else out there, life is all decisions.
[01:58:24] And everything you do
[01:58:28] is based on decisions that you make.
[01:58:32] So think about the process.
[01:58:34] And think about the amount of control
[01:58:37] that these decisions give you over your own life.
[01:58:41] And think about the impact that these decisions have
[01:58:44] in your life.
[01:58:45] So don't just let them happen.
[01:58:49] Make them happen.
[01:58:51] Make them happen by being aware of your decisions
[01:58:54] and make them happen by having a protocol
[01:58:58] so you make the right decisions to do the right things
[01:59:01] so you can be a better leader, a better person
[01:59:05] and lead a better life.
[01:59:08] And until next time, this is Echo and Jaco.
[01:59:11] Ciao.
