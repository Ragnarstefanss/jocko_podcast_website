[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 367 with echo Charles and me Jocko willing a good evening echo good evening
[00:00:06] I don't like going to the doctor. Okay, just FYI. I don't like hospitals
[00:00:11] actually, I
[00:00:13] Always think that things are they're just gonna heal up right the body's just gonna Wolverine and just heal up and
[00:00:21] They do most of the time occasionally they don't
[00:00:26] One time I woke up in the morning, I couldn't move my right arm
[00:00:28] But didn't move which is not a good feeling. I
[00:00:32] Was like, okay. Well, it'll get better. It didn't
[00:00:35] Had to go to the doctor
[00:00:38] Went to the doctor got you know neck surgery. So unless something is really bad
[00:00:44] I'm not going to the doctor. I
[00:00:48] Don't know if that's left over from basic seal training where they you're avoiding medical at all costs
[00:00:53] Because you don't want to get rolled or anything, but it's stuck with me. Don't like the doctor a little while after I had neck surgery I
[00:01:01] Start I would start randomly getting dizzy
[00:01:06] Like
[00:01:07] Like dizzy like I just spun around in circles. Sometimes I would get really dizzy sometimes I would be trying to walk and
[00:01:15] I would be bouncing into walls. So I'm talking legitimately busy. I was nauseous a
[00:01:21] lot
[00:01:23] Almost almost like a continual almost all the time nauseous and
[00:01:30] Man sometimes jiu-jitsu I would be doing jiu-jitsu and I'd like roll or spin or something like that
[00:01:36] And it would just be the jet the whole gym would just start spinning
[00:01:40] sometimes I would roll over in bed at night and
[00:01:42] The room would start spinning it was then you know, you're feeling sick and I kind of learned
[00:01:49] To avoid some things, you know and jiu-jitsu I try not to go inverted and stuff like this and in bed
[00:01:57] I've learned to roll out if I wanted to roll over in bed or even to roll to get out of bed
[00:02:02] I would learn to do it very very slowly and avoid
[00:02:06] head movement
[00:02:08] And I thought it would go away
[00:02:09] And I'm waiting for go to a waiting for Wolverine blood to flow and for the problem to stop and it didn't stop
[00:02:15] So again went to the hospital once the doctor and they did all kinds of tests on me MRI tests and blood tests and they
[00:02:24] Ear nose and throat spine and they just did they look at everything and they didn't have an answer for me
[00:02:30] And so I'm just dealing with it just btf and just dealing with it
[00:02:36] and it definitely sucked and
[00:02:39] Then like so fast forward a year or something like that
[00:02:42] I'm actually starting my retirement processing and I'm starting my
[00:02:48] Retirement physical you got to get a physical before you retire and I'm talking to the doc for the West Coast seals and
[00:02:54] What's cool about this particular doc as he was a seal himself who had gone to the military medical school and become a doctor
[00:03:00] So, you know, we knew each other
[00:03:02] And he's get you know, we're hanging out and then he's given me sort of this the standard retirement physical questions
[00:03:08] About my health and I'm giving him the standard retirement answers, which is fine. Yep fine. Yep, that's fine
[00:03:16] And finally, you know, we're just kind of shooting shooting the breeze a little bit. He goes anything else, you know, did I miss anything and
[00:03:24] I said, well, you know
[00:03:27] No one's been able to help me but I'll throw it out there. I said, yeah, man for the last like year year and a half
[00:03:33] I've randomly
[00:03:35] Gotten just really dizzy sometimes and sometimes it lasts for a long time and it kind of never goes away
[00:03:42] I'm always in like a constant state of that
[00:03:45] He's like kind of tilts his head a little bit look to me and
[00:03:48] Kind of thumbing through my record. He seemed now that he's looking at his scenes a bunch of tests that I've been through and everything like this
[00:03:55] And he says, you know, I think I might know what this might be and
[00:03:59] He literally like turns to his computer and this is 2010 but
[00:04:03] Or maybe it was 2009 something like that because I retired in 2010
[00:04:07] But it was something it was like around that time, but he turns his computer and he googles some stuff
[00:04:11] And he's like here here look at this
[00:04:14] And he says benign positional vertigo
[00:04:17] He goes we got to do these little exercises
[00:04:20] and
[00:04:21] I'm like
[00:04:22] Okay, I mean, I don't know what he's talking about right benign positional vertigo. I don't know what this means and
[00:04:29] Then he like says okay lay down put your head over here turn it backwards turn over sit back up again
[00:04:34] And he goes just does like three or four times does these exercise and then like says all right stand up
[00:04:41] And he looks at me and he goes how how's that?
[00:04:44] And I'm like doing a self-assessment and I'm like
[00:04:49] Dude
[00:04:51] It's gone
[00:04:52] I'm good like literally in two minutes
[00:04:56] More than a year of dizziness and constant
[00:05:00] Tests and exams and this thing has gone in two minutes that seal doc
[00:05:05] Gave me my balance back
[00:05:08] And it was pretty freakin awesome and this particular doc has helped
[00:05:15] Countless other seals overcome countless health challenges of all kinds
[00:05:21] His name is Kirk Parsley
[00:05:23] And
[00:05:25] It's an honor to have him with us here today to talk about what he learned
[00:05:30] in his life in the teams and
[00:05:34] Taking care of team guys. So doc
[00:05:37] Thanks for coming by man. Hey, man. Thanks for having you remember that. I mean I know you see like eight million people
[00:05:42] So I remember very clearly
[00:05:45] Yeah, did you with the Eplume maneuver?
[00:05:47] Yeah, but you you you weren't like sure about it
[00:05:51] When you said it to me you're sort of like look at you kind of it was like
[00:05:55] It seemed as if you had heard a rumor about something that it could have been and you kind of like halfway remembered it
[00:06:01] And then you I could I could remember I could remember the name of the test that you do to test people for that right
[00:06:08] And I was like and I'm blanking on now
[00:06:11] It's like pikes haul something or like this and I was like hmm
[00:06:15] And you look for the nystagmus right the shaking of the eyes and something you do to like hop on the ground
[00:06:20] something you do to like hospital patients and
[00:06:23] And so I knew that part and I was like I know
[00:06:26] So there's a little stone in one of your semi-circular canals and it's blocking that and so the fluid's not flowing and it's the same as sea sickness or something right at that point and so
[00:06:35] I remember
[00:06:37] I remember well, there's there's a way to tilt there's a way to tilt this out and I couldn't remember if there's like a certain pattern could give three
[00:06:43] Canals and they're all at different angles. So that's why you like turn your head at all these different angles so many times
[00:06:47] And I was like, oh, I know there's another something to like do this and you know medicine's full of
[00:06:52] What called eponyms like you know the shit's just named after people right so what is Epley maneuver?
[00:06:59] It's not descriptive at all. So I don't know what the hell that means to somebody's name and there's a new
[00:07:04] I'm like there's some kind of thing and so that's what I googled like you know clearing
[00:07:10] Odell
[00:07:11] Yeah, and so it's just like clearing the stones that are in the semi-circular canal and I think I'm looking for that video
[00:07:18] I'm like, oh, here's how we do it. So I
[00:07:21] Remember like gleaning the table back down and going to do it right because like we knew each other. We didn't know each other super well at that point
[00:07:28] Me but you had your fucking
[00:07:31] BTF
[00:07:33] You know
[00:07:34] Reputation
[00:07:35] I don't know if I ever told you did you ever hear about the bracelets?
[00:07:39] No at our clinic right so we at the rehab clinic
[00:07:44] You know Jason chain trained all these guys and
[00:07:49] You know
[00:07:51] It's hard to bounce back from surgeries a lot of time right and people aren't all that motivated because they're just they're used to like this
[00:07:57] Performance. I mean I'm supposed to be up here and like they're barely like they're barely performing like a grade school kid or something
[00:08:05] And so there's always a motivation component and so he had these tests for people to like you know try to try to get to this level
[00:08:14] Try to get to that level try to it's like these progressive steps and so and then there was some sort of reward involved in it and that's
[00:08:20] That's how we ended up doing Sears Tower with Elliott and all that stuff like that was part of the reward kind of pathway and
[00:08:27] One thing we so this is heretic and I hope your audience doesn't hate me for saying this but the WW JD
[00:08:34] What would Jesus do bracelet weird like a hundred of those and we gave them and they were what would jaco do?
[00:08:41] And we had like this running list on the wall like
[00:08:45] Chuck Norris kind of
[00:08:48] My contribution was
[00:08:50] Jocko sleeps with the pillow under his gun
[00:08:52] Yeah, so you know you had reputation and I knew you're and it's and I remember doing all that and going oh this works
[00:09:04] And yeah, and and I and then we you know as we got to know each other more of the years
[00:09:09] I know you you had to do that. Do you still have to do it?
[00:09:12] I probably have to do it once a year and it but it's it's just such a non factor now
[00:09:17] I go there it is. I'm a little dizzy. I just do it and man. It's I was like that for a year and a half and it was
[00:09:24] Gnarly gnarly. I remember I was doing I was training a guy for a fight an MMA fight and
[00:09:31] He was like ground and pound like we had gloves on like we're going at it and all of a sudden like I did something where I did
[00:09:37] A quick head movement and all of a sudden I got super like like more even more dizzy than normal
[00:09:42] And I'm standing there. I'm like laying on my back and he's in my garden. He's punching me in the head and
[00:09:47] I look at the clock and the clock. There's like this was this was Thomas remember Thomas
[00:09:54] Yeah, yeah, I mean he's this freaking Polish warrior. Yeah, and he's punching me in the head and I'm there's like 20 seconds left
[00:10:03] And I'm just like please let this stop and I I got up and walk and I like was doing a drunk walk out, you know all unstable
[00:10:12] And he was kind of like looking at me as if he had hit me too hard or something is just like no, I'm leaving now
[00:10:20] That and when the good thing you have thick skull
[00:10:24] From that guy for sure. He's a beast. Yeah, I had a actually that's when that's when yawn the the
[00:10:30] Champ yeah, not currently but
[00:10:33] Hopefully coming back for it. Just part with that maniac dude. That's not a good way to be healthy
[00:10:42] Yeah, and then I had the I don't know if you remember this I I
[00:10:46] Go I
[00:10:48] Was training jiu-jitsu
[00:10:51] I didn't I did a no Dean did a
[00:10:55] Bicep slice on me and like my bicep like
[00:10:57] Popped and moved and I was like God you got a partial tear remember any and so I go in I see Jason
[00:11:02] I see doc and they're like yep. Hey, we can get you scheduled for surgery right now
[00:11:05] You know like and I go cool like sign me up. Let's rock and roll and then they go
[00:11:09] Okay, yep, we got you signed up your your surgery is gonna be in four weeks or something like this three weeks or something like this
[00:11:15] And they go come in on this day for your pre-surgery check
[00:11:18] I go cool and so I go in I'm like Jason you have him here for my pre-check and he goes
[00:11:22] He starts looking at me all weird and stuff like I'm not normal and he's like hey doc
[00:11:26] Can you come and they come and look at me and they're like
[00:11:29] You're healed
[00:11:33] And I was like yes, yeah, I I'm back. I see
[00:11:37] I remember I remember that like they're they're still being like some sort of defect in that and
[00:11:44] And we I remember we told you like well still might rip right with what you do because like you're resisting an arm bar or something
[00:11:51] You know you doing pull-ups, whatever. Maybe it might still rip and and you're like what happens if it rips or like
[00:11:58] Well, then you do this surgery like same surgery pretty much like well to see if it rips
[00:12:04] You just went on about your life and I guess it never ripped
[00:12:07] No, I'm not sure if it rips
[00:12:09] Now now echo over here. He's had one on each arm. He's done. I need that surgery twice
[00:12:13] Did I call you when you when that happened to me was I like hey, what's up? Yeah?
[00:12:16] So remember that's funny
[00:12:18] You don't remember because I was I'm glad you're here to kind of confirm that cuz I didn't believe I was like, right?
[00:12:23] It wasn't ripped. Yeah, you can it's not just gonna heal like that. Like it wasn't ripped like the doc made a mistake or whatever
[00:12:29] You're like no no, I'm like Wolverine Wolverine
[00:12:31] He's got a little bit of a point of view, but I think that's what he's talking about
[00:12:35] the doc made a mistake or whatever.
[00:12:37] You're like, no, no, no, no, I'm like, Wolverine.
[00:12:39] I was like, that sounds good.
[00:12:42] That does sound cool, but Brad didn't write or whatever.
[00:12:45] He was like, whatever.
[00:12:47] It was like an argument.
[00:12:48] We would kind of be-
[00:12:48] So do you accept now?
[00:12:49] I do accept.
[00:12:50] Yeah, thanks for confirming that.
[00:12:52] All right, enough about that.
[00:12:54] Let's get into you.
[00:12:54] Let's start at the beginning.
[00:12:55] So where were you born?
[00:12:58] Where were you born?
[00:12:59] Where'd you grow up?
[00:13:00] I was born in sort of a sub area of Houston, Spring,
[00:13:06] Spring, Texas, Spring Branch, actually.
[00:13:08] So Spring Branch Hospital in Houston, outside of Houston.
[00:13:11] And then is that where you spent your youth?
[00:13:14] Yeah, pretty much.
[00:13:15] So by today's standards, definitely,
[00:13:17] because Katie, where I'd spent like the second half
[00:13:21] of my childhood was in Katie,
[00:13:25] that was like 45 minutes outside of Houston then.
[00:13:29] And now it's just part of Houston.
[00:13:30] Like all the sprawl.
[00:13:32] Like you literally drove through like cow pastures
[00:13:35] and rice fields for 45 minutes.
[00:13:37] And then there was this one road,
[00:13:39] and you took that one road for like three or four miles,
[00:13:41] and then you ran into the neighborhoods of Katie.
[00:13:45] And last time I went there,
[00:13:48] there's no break from downtown Houston to that.
[00:13:51] It's like all concrete, jungle, like shopping centers.
[00:13:54] Big sprawl.
[00:13:56] I couldn't even find the house I grew up in.
[00:13:58] You think it's still there or no?
[00:13:59] It's still there.
[00:14:00] But like all the landmarks I knew to look for,
[00:14:03] and they've renamed some streets and stuff.
[00:14:05] And so when you get off the freeway now,
[00:14:08] there's streets immediately.
[00:14:09] Well, there was nothing, like I said,
[00:14:11] for three or four miles, there was just pastures
[00:14:13] where we rode our motorcycles and played football
[00:14:15] and whatever, even when hunting.
[00:14:18] And that was all, you know, on whatever farmland
[00:14:22] and on touch thicket.
[00:14:24] And it was just like buildings and shopping centers
[00:14:28] and streets.
[00:14:28] And I'm like, I don't really know how far down to go.
[00:14:32] And I was looking for the main kind of street
[00:14:34] that went through my neighborhood.
[00:14:35] And I think they renamed that street
[00:14:39] because they connected it and it's much longer now.
[00:14:41] And so I couldn't figure out where to turn left
[00:14:46] to like go into the neighborhood.
[00:14:48] So small town in Texas.
[00:14:50] How come you don't have a Texas accent?
[00:14:52] I do when I get really tired.
[00:14:53] It's kind of coming back more.
[00:14:57] I deliberately got rid of it.
[00:14:59] How come?
[00:15:01] Just to avoid being chastised for, you know,
[00:15:04] like being in the military and people screw with you about,
[00:15:09] because I listen to country music and I drove a truck
[00:15:11] and, you know, like, redneck, you know,
[00:15:18] Chris, my good friend of mine from the steel teams,
[00:15:22] he's from essentially Detroit, right?
[00:15:25] And he goes like, damn, Texas, go get me some chili.
[00:15:29] And everybody just rode me all the time.
[00:15:32] So I didn't have a super thick accent,
[00:15:34] but, you know, I purposefully got rid of it
[00:15:38] now that I'm back in Texas and everybody talks
[00:15:39] like I used to talk.
[00:15:41] It's coming back.
[00:15:42] It comes back.
[00:15:43] And then if I get really tired, I think my deflates,
[00:15:48] that's my rule.
[00:15:49] Like, I think it's an unconscious effort now
[00:15:52] to not do that and not.
[00:15:55] I've let the clochialisms come back.
[00:15:56] Like now I'm fixing to do something.
[00:15:58] I wouldn't do that.
[00:15:59] And I say y'all instead, you guys,
[00:16:01] and I've always thought that was more appropriate
[00:16:03] because like that's a contraction for you all.
[00:16:05] And guys, this is a gender word.
[00:16:08] So it doesn't make any sense.
[00:16:09] It's called a bunch of girls.
[00:16:10] Hey, you guys.
[00:16:11] Hey, y'all, right?
[00:16:12] So yeah, it kind of comes and goes.
[00:16:18] What'd your parents do?
[00:16:19] Well, my father split.
[00:16:24] That was what he did.
[00:16:25] So like about, I was like six weeks old or something.
[00:16:29] And so I actually met him at my wedding when it was 25.
[00:16:34] So what'd your mom do?
[00:16:35] My mom, so the first half of my childhood,
[00:16:42] I mean, we were poor trailer part trash, you know.
[00:16:47] And but my mom actually had to drop out of high school
[00:16:51] to raise her younger sisters
[00:16:52] because her parents ran off, you know.
[00:16:54] And so my mom had us when we were super young.
[00:16:57] Like me and my sister, she had like 18, 19 years old.
[00:17:00] And so she, you know, she got married
[00:17:05] right out of high school essentially.
[00:17:08] And so she went to, she's going to college
[00:17:11] and working as like a cocktail waitress or something
[00:17:13] like when I was young.
[00:17:14] And then when she remarried,
[00:17:16] just when we moved to Katie and she married a,
[00:17:21] who's a cop at the time and he'd went on to do other things.
[00:17:27] But she started working with Delta Airlines
[00:17:29] and was like a reservationist
[00:17:30] and then making my flight attendant.
[00:17:32] And then she retired from that
[00:17:34] and worked for Southwest as a flight attendant for a while.
[00:17:36] And now she's in her seventies
[00:17:38] and she just retired like a couple of years ago
[00:17:41] from Southwest.
[00:17:42] She's been getting after it.
[00:17:42] She's a hard, she's a hard like Irish redheads.
[00:17:46] Like feisty, wiry, straffy, strong woman, you know.
[00:17:50] And so, yeah.
[00:17:53] And she divorced that stepfather when I was like 16.
[00:17:58] He's a super, super abusive to everybody,
[00:18:02] but especially me.
[00:18:04] And so.
[00:18:06] So how did you react to that?
[00:18:10] Well, it was a big insult to me
[00:18:12] because I was the man of the house until that, right?
[00:18:14] So it was like eight, I was up, up until like eight years old.
[00:18:17] She got married when I was like eight or nine
[00:18:19] and a group of all women.
[00:18:21] So it's my mom, her mom, her sisters, my sister.
[00:18:26] And at five years old, they'd be like,
[00:18:30] Kirk, I think I heard something.
[00:18:32] Good look, right?
[00:18:33] So, okay.
[00:18:35] Get my red rider BB gun and like go and look in,
[00:18:38] look in the living room, see if anybody's there.
[00:18:40] Literally sent me out in the front yard to kill a water mox
[00:18:43] and with a BB gun.
[00:18:44] And thank God like a man was driving by
[00:18:48] and saw this shit show about to happen.
[00:18:50] I'm gonna go save this little boy.
[00:18:52] And so he came out and like, you know,
[00:18:54] and I taught me how to, you know,
[00:18:55] I'd stepped on the snake's head and cut its head off
[00:18:58] with his health and all that and whatever.
[00:18:59] So I was really blown away by the fact that.
[00:19:05] Some other dude showed up.
[00:19:06] Some dude's gonna like hurt my mother or hurt my sister,
[00:19:11] right?
[00:19:11] And so I'd always like try to get involved.
[00:19:13] And then he'd turn on me.
[00:19:15] And so that was my strategy for a while,
[00:19:16] but he's an evil fucking.
[00:19:19] Yeah.
[00:19:20] And so he figured out, well, it's worse
[00:19:23] if I don't turn on Kirk, right?
[00:19:26] Just let me keep trying to interject and just ignore me
[00:19:30] and keep me hurting my mom or whatever.
[00:19:33] So, so I grew up very fucking angry, very angry.
[00:19:38] And I went in to kill him and I fully planned on it.
[00:19:44] And, you know, my mom, I asked my mom for a wait set
[00:19:51] for Christmas when I was eight.
[00:19:55] Pumping iron had come out.
[00:19:56] I'd seen Arnold.
[00:19:57] Yeah.
[00:19:58] I was like, you know, the muscles,
[00:19:59] I'm gonna crush that mom.
[00:20:01] And I knew my dad was a big dude and kind of a badass
[00:20:05] and they knew each other.
[00:20:08] I grew up in kind of in the same town.
[00:20:11] And so I think I was a threat to him.
[00:20:14] I was my potential father.
[00:20:17] So his biggest fear of it was that I was gonna go
[00:20:19] to be better than him, bigger, better, faster,
[00:20:23] stronger, whatever.
[00:20:24] And all of this fears came true.
[00:20:27] But at 16, I had...
[00:20:33] So did you get the wait set at eight?
[00:20:35] I got the wait set at eight.
[00:20:36] You started a jacket steal?
[00:20:37] He came into me, he came into my room and was like,
[00:20:40] heard you want a wait set.
[00:20:41] You want a wait set, or you want to be one of those faggots.
[00:20:44] And I'm like, sorry, excuse me.
[00:20:46] And he's telling me, well, bodybuilders are all gay.
[00:20:49] And that's why they like shave their bodies
[00:20:52] and bury it on other men and all this other stuff.
[00:20:53] And I'm like, I don't think so, whatever.
[00:20:57] So I went to wait.
[00:20:58] So I didn't know what to do with him.
[00:20:59] I got like the little borrow with the concrete weights.
[00:21:01] Oh yeah.
[00:21:02] And I was grounded my whole life,
[00:21:04] the whole time I was with him.
[00:21:05] So if I got a bad report card,
[00:21:07] I got grounded to the next report card.
[00:21:09] And then grounded to the next,
[00:21:11] and then the last report card of the year,
[00:21:13] I was grounded six weeks into the summer,
[00:21:15] because that's when another report card would get.
[00:21:16] So I'd had like eight weeks of summer.
[00:21:19] Like that was the only time I had any kind of social life.
[00:21:21] So sat in my room a lot, got grounded in my room a lot.
[00:21:24] And I'd sit, like all I knew had to do was overhead press.
[00:21:27] That's what you think of it.
[00:21:28] I just sit there and like overhead pressed
[00:21:30] from front and back, from back, front,
[00:21:32] and then in curl, and that's all I did.
[00:21:34] And I just sit in my room for hours and just lift weights.
[00:21:39] And then every time I tried to take any kind of martial arts,
[00:21:43] he did everything, could thwart that.
[00:21:46] And so I'd get in something
[00:21:50] and he'd just make it impossible for me
[00:21:52] to stick with it and all that.
[00:21:53] So I was really, really angry.
[00:21:56] And the only reason I think I was good at football
[00:21:59] is because I was so damn angry.
[00:22:00] And I was a big, fast, strong kid.
[00:22:06] And I just literally wanted to hurt everybody I could.
[00:22:10] Like it was a way for me to hurt people
[00:22:11] and not get in trouble, because like getting in fights,
[00:22:13] you know, it's getting trouble for the fights
[00:22:14] or most of the time you get in trouble.
[00:22:15] How old were you when you started playing football?
[00:22:19] Actually, I started in kindergarten.
[00:22:22] I played, we lived on this island in the ship channel.
[00:22:25] That's where our trailer was.
[00:22:26] And it's Kema, Texas is the name of it.
[00:22:28] You know, it just now it's like a kind of a Ritzy tourist area.
[00:22:31] But it was just like this little blue collar crappy,
[00:22:34] did a bunch of shrimp boats and stuff.
[00:22:37] And so I lived there, literally my sister and I said,
[00:22:43] you're old and I, we walked to school,
[00:22:45] crossed these railroad tracks.
[00:22:46] And I remember walking to football practice,
[00:22:50] walking home from a football game,
[00:22:51] like me and my pads, her and her cheerleader outfit.
[00:22:53] And we're like walking probably two miles
[00:22:56] to school, going across these major roads,
[00:22:58] whatever it's like parenting
[00:23:00] was a totally different bag back then, right?
[00:23:02] But my mom was like, she's surviving.
[00:23:04] She's like going to school at night
[00:23:06] and or going to school in the day, working at night.
[00:23:09] And then her sisters were just kids too, right?
[00:23:11] Like her sisters are reasons, but they're 15.
[00:23:13] Like we're a 15 year old now.
[00:23:15] And like sometimes the 15 year old gets in the car
[00:23:18] when the car runs and drives this around and whatever.
[00:23:20] So it was a pretty sketchy scene.
[00:23:23] And then, you know, in Texas, you can start playing.
[00:23:25] So I played what we call dad's club,
[00:23:28] Pop Warner out here, right?
[00:23:30] I played that.
[00:23:31] And then in Texas,
[00:23:32] you can start playing for your school in junior high.
[00:23:34] Okay.
[00:23:35] And I had the head coach in junior high was a former Marine
[00:23:41] and he took a liking to me.
[00:23:44] And so I did well in junior high football
[00:23:47] and then transferred to the really,
[00:23:51] a really good football team by our high school.
[00:23:53] They're two high schools and Katie,
[00:23:57] the one I went to was the newer one.
[00:23:59] And they'd only been open a couple of years
[00:24:00] when I started it.
[00:24:02] But we were going to, we had a great coaching staff
[00:24:06] and you know, in Texas, like these dudes are making
[00:24:12] big money and like, and they got recruited out to Odessa
[00:24:15] my senior year, but really, really good coaching.
[00:24:19] And that's what led me into powerlifting
[00:24:22] is one of my coaches was a powerlifter.
[00:24:25] And he, and I don't know if I was the strongest
[00:24:30] in like every lift, but I was,
[00:24:31] I was one of the strongest in everything.
[00:24:33] And I was the strongest in several of the things.
[00:24:37] And so he was, he took a liking to me.
[00:24:39] And he's like, I'm gonna teach you how to lift for real
[00:24:42] cause you're like, you're just in this football lifting.
[00:24:43] And so he taught me like the below parallel squats, right?
[00:24:48] And I had to do it with a bar
[00:24:50] and then to do a hundred perfect reps before he'd let me
[00:24:52] put any weight on.
[00:24:53] Damn.
[00:24:55] And it took me like a month.
[00:24:56] He would sit down next to me and just watching.
[00:24:59] Yeah.
[00:25:00] Nope. And he'd turn around and walk away.
[00:25:03] That was it for the day.
[00:25:04] And for the, that was on the second rep.
[00:25:05] It was on the second rep.
[00:25:06] It was on the 98th rep.
[00:25:07] It was the 98th rep.
[00:25:08] And they're like, nope.
[00:25:09] And then did you, did you have the potential
[00:25:11] of playing in college?
[00:25:16] I could have played.
[00:25:17] I don't, I don't think I would have,
[00:25:19] I wouldn't have excelled.
[00:25:20] I just wasn't big enough.
[00:25:21] I mean, I was, I was, I actually grew a couple inches
[00:25:24] in the Navy.
[00:25:26] So I, when, when I enlisted at 17, I was five, 11.
[00:25:32] I grew like two, six, one somewhere
[00:25:35] in the first couple of years.
[00:25:36] I don't know.
[00:25:36] Did you, how did you hear about the Navy?
[00:25:41] Well, and did you, and did you know about the teams?
[00:25:44] Yeah. So that's a funny story.
[00:25:46] So the recruiter, we had a recruiting office in T and Katie
[00:25:51] and the recruiter, the Marine recruiter was a boxer.
[00:25:56] And, and my last year of high school, I lived alone,
[00:26:03] or I lived in an apartment with, actually with a guy
[00:26:06] who enlisted in the gym.
[00:26:07] So I split an apartment, but I know where I worked
[00:26:10] at a gym as, as like the assistant manager of this gym.
[00:26:15] And anyway, and I would box with this Marine recruiter
[00:26:21] and you know, Heartbreaker Ridge had already been out.
[00:26:23] So it was like, force recon.
[00:26:25] And, and I, you know, and I love, like I've always loved
[00:26:28] the water, like I've always been like,
[00:26:29] I was always a lifeguard and we were always like doing
[00:26:31] water sports and going to the beach whenever we could
[00:26:33] and all that stuff, working on breath holds
[00:26:36] just because it was cool.
[00:26:37] In fact, like I would go in a pool and just be so upset
[00:26:40] that I had to come up, right?
[00:26:41] Cause I like, I'd sit on the bottom of the pool,
[00:26:43] like I just want to stay here for like,
[00:26:45] and you know, now sort of I knew more of the physiology
[00:26:48] of like what I was now like a settling down my nervous system.
[00:26:50] Honestly, and I was feeling really good in there.
[00:26:52] And so, yeah, so anyway, then I started boxing
[00:27:00] with this Marine recruiter and, and this documentary
[00:27:07] came out 48 hours.
[00:27:10] It's a news documentary show, like it's like 60 minutes,
[00:27:12] but it was called 48 hours.
[00:27:15] And they followed a budge class, actually,
[00:27:18] Krimmins, you remember Krimmins?
[00:27:19] Yeah.
[00:27:20] So Krimmins was like the star of this.
[00:27:21] They're following a budge class.
[00:27:22] Okay.
[00:27:23] And they,
[00:27:24] Was he in the class?
[00:27:25] He was in the class.
[00:27:25] Like he was, he was the guy, right?
[00:27:27] Like he was the one, he was the guy who got all the camera
[00:27:29] attention because he was like this salty old,
[00:27:31] for sure, fisherman from Boston or something, right?
[00:27:34] Somewhere in New England.
[00:27:35] And, and they kept saying,
[00:27:37] this is the toughest training in the world.
[00:27:39] This is the toughest.
[00:27:40] And what did I grow up doing?
[00:27:41] Like with this abusive stuff out there,
[00:27:43] I wanted to be the toughest.
[00:27:44] I wanted to be the biggest badass in the world.
[00:27:46] Right?
[00:27:46] That's what I wanted.
[00:27:48] And so I would,
[00:27:50] I, I watched that thing,
[00:27:52] I recorded on VHS and I watched that thing like 20 times.
[00:27:56] And then waited for the Marine recruiter to be out of town.
[00:28:00] And I went over to the Navy and talked to him
[00:28:02] about being a seal.
[00:28:03] What year in high school were you?
[00:28:06] Well, it was my fourth year,
[00:28:07] but my fourth year I was only a sophomore by credits.
[00:28:11] So.
[00:28:11] Was that cause you just were failing everything?
[00:28:13] What was going on?
[00:28:14] I started failing classes as soon as my mom got remarried
[00:28:18] and I got in that world.
[00:28:19] Like when you have screaming, fighting
[00:28:23] and cops over at your house all the time, it's like,
[00:28:26] you know, and I'm grounded all the time at home
[00:28:28] and he's abusive and I'm obviously like hiding from,
[00:28:31] like, and it just,
[00:28:32] I wasn't going to be doing homework.
[00:28:33] And then like my sympathetic nervous system
[00:28:35] was ramped up to hell.
[00:28:36] Like I'm, I'm in fight or flight kind of all the time
[00:28:39] being home.
[00:28:41] And so, yeah, I,
[00:28:48] I, whatever, I, I, I was a screwed up.
[00:28:52] I was a super screwed up kid.
[00:28:54] But anyway, so Bivens out of town,
[00:28:57] I went and talked to the Navy recruiter
[00:29:00] and he's like, I've never put in a seal before.
[00:29:02] I don't know, I'll look into it.
[00:29:03] And that they just started the delayed entry program.
[00:29:06] So that started literally months before I signed up.
[00:29:11] So I told my mom what I wanted to do.
[00:29:13] And she's like, all right.
[00:29:14] So she signed off when I went on 17.
[00:29:15] She's like, cool, off the payroll.
[00:29:17] Yeah.
[00:29:17] And yes.
[00:29:18] So anyway, yeah, I, so from like third grade
[00:29:21] through four years of high school,
[00:29:24] I don't, I'd never really legitimately passed any class
[00:29:27] unless the teacher liked me.
[00:29:28] And then everybody starts telling you what a moron you are
[00:29:32] and you're afraid of people finding out.
[00:29:35] So you're like, you know, I don't,
[00:29:36] I want to call any attention to my stupidity.
[00:29:39] So I'm just like being quiet.
[00:29:40] And like, and so nobody, like none of my friends knew
[00:29:43] that I was behind in high school.
[00:29:44] Like none of my, none of my friends knew
[00:29:45] that I wasn't going to graduate.
[00:29:47] I knew I wasn't going to graduate
[00:29:49] because I wasn't going to stick around for two or three
[00:29:51] or four years to get through high school, obviously.
[00:29:54] And so when I joined, I was just like, you know,
[00:29:56] at some point I'm going to go to GED.
[00:29:58] And then, and then I took the ASFAB
[00:30:01] and actually did decent on that.
[00:30:05] And yeah, so I joined, and I didn't tell,
[00:30:11] I still didn't tell the Marine Corps,
[00:30:13] because I was like, Fred, you're just going to be so pissed off
[00:30:15] of me.
[00:30:16] And then, yeah, just like a month,
[00:30:21] we had all these street parties, you know,
[00:30:22] like vacant streets, you'd go,
[00:30:25] park our cars, turn our lights on,
[00:30:26] have keg parties and whatever.
[00:30:28] And it was always a mix of the high schools
[00:30:32] and there's always some friction
[00:30:34] because we were rivals, you know, in sports.
[00:30:36] And so about a month after I joined,
[00:30:39] about a month after my Marine career found out
[00:30:43] that I joined, I think it was a couple of months
[00:30:47] after I joined, I tried to break up a fight
[00:30:53] and the students swung on me and like graced me.
[00:30:56] I had decent enough head movement together
[00:31:00] the way everybody like graced me.
[00:31:02] And I was such an angry rage ball and so arrogant.
[00:31:07] I was maximally offended that somebody tried to this.
[00:31:10] I'm like, who the fuck do you think you are?
[00:31:13] So I try to look at the guy just bewildered
[00:31:16] and I guess there's something in my eyes
[00:31:17] that made him realize that he took off running.
[00:31:21] And so I took off running after him
[00:31:23] and I fucking body slammed him down the street
[00:31:25] and punch him in one of his buddies
[00:31:26] come and I should be beating his ass
[00:31:27] and I beat up these two guys, right?
[00:31:29] And just one guy, he's curled up in the fetal position
[00:31:32] and I'm picking him up by his ears
[00:31:33] and telling him to fight and he won't,
[00:31:34] not like just spitting his face.
[00:31:35] Like I was angry, nasty dude.
[00:31:38] And anyway, and so I pull up to see my Marine recruiter,
[00:31:44] or to see the Navy recruiter,
[00:31:46] I pull up to the recruiting office a few days later
[00:31:47] and the Marine recruiter comes out and says,
[00:31:51] so what's this I hear about you beating up on my Marines?
[00:31:54] And I'm like, huh?
[00:31:56] Yeah, so anyway, so I walked that thing over and over again,
[00:32:00] wanted to do toughest training in the world,
[00:32:03] went and joined, I didn't know what a seal was.
[00:32:08] I didn't even, I didn't know what a seal was
[00:32:09] when I was in Buds.
[00:32:11] I wanted to do the toughest training in the world.
[00:32:13] And yeah, I gradually learned more and more,
[00:32:16] but I still didn't know.
[00:32:17] Like when, I don't know if they did it when you went through,
[00:32:21] if you were a couple of years after me, I think, right?
[00:32:23] But they used to take us around
[00:32:25] all the different SEAL teams
[00:32:26] and then you had to rank choice,
[00:32:27] like the team, and you had to rank choice to the East Coast,
[00:32:30] well, also without visiting any of those.
[00:32:33] And I remember like when they started taking us around
[00:32:35] to the teams right before graduation,
[00:32:38] remember it kind of hitting me that,
[00:32:39] oh, I don't actually know what this used to do.
[00:32:42] Oh, here's how naive I was.
[00:32:45] So you remember the delayed entry program
[00:32:46] gave people three chances of passing the test.
[00:32:49] Okay.
[00:32:49] Okay, so you could take the PRT and if you passed it,
[00:32:53] you were guaranteed to go to Buds first.
[00:32:56] Because remember the way it was before,
[00:32:58] you could pass the PRT,
[00:32:59] but then your gaining command had to agree
[00:33:03] to let you go to Buds instead of coming to them,
[00:33:05] which almost never happened, right?
[00:33:06] So you had to go to the fleet for a couple of years
[00:33:08] to come back.
[00:33:09] So the delayed entry program was all about,
[00:33:11] if you passed the PRT, you'd definitely go
[00:33:12] and it gives you three chances to pass the PRT
[00:33:14] and then you get like some sort of promotion
[00:33:17] out of bootcamp, promotion out of A-School.
[00:33:20] And so, yeah, so I took the test
[00:33:25] and I remember his name was Petty Officer Winkler,
[00:33:29] he was the first class, he was a Vietnam Air Seal,
[00:33:32] like all Vietnam Air Seals, super cool guy.
[00:33:35] And so they had like a morning training
[00:33:39] for people who failed the test
[00:33:41] to go in and work on the swimming,
[00:33:42] work out, like whatever they weren't gonna go work out.
[00:33:45] So you had to get up a couple of hours earlier
[00:33:47] an hour earlier and you could go
[00:33:48] and they excused you from a little bit of your time
[00:33:52] at the, in your regular bootcamp company
[00:33:54] because we didn't have our own stuff back then, as you know.
[00:33:57] And so I just smoked the PRT and Winkler really liked me
[00:34:03] and he's like, hey, you should come in the mornings
[00:34:05] and you can coach guys.
[00:34:07] Cause obviously it worked at a gym
[00:34:08] and I was like sort of a personal trainer and stuff anyway.
[00:34:12] So I was doing that and then got to be really good friends
[00:34:15] with him and the other seal motivator.
[00:34:18] And after I coached people in the mornings,
[00:34:22] I'd end up sitting in their office shooting the shit.
[00:34:25] They'd be drinking coffee, I didn't drink coffee.
[00:34:27] And he said something about dive pay
[00:34:30] or hazard duty pay or something.
[00:34:32] And I was like, what's that?
[00:34:33] And he starts explaining it to me.
[00:34:36] And this light bulb goes off in my head.
[00:34:37] I'm like, I'm gonna get paid?
[00:34:40] And he thought that was the funniest damn thing
[00:34:45] he'd ever heard.
[00:34:45] So he took me around to every office.
[00:34:47] Like, tell them what you just said to me.
[00:34:49] And so I literally, I was just a dumb kid.
[00:34:55] Like I just wanted to go do this training.
[00:34:57] I didn't know it was gonna get paid.
[00:34:58] Like, why are you gonna pay me?
[00:35:00] Cause right now you're giving me a place to live,
[00:35:02] you're giving me clothes and then there's a chow hall.
[00:35:04] Like, what do I need money for?
[00:35:06] I figure, like I'm just gonna be training
[00:35:08] to kill people or going to kill people.
[00:35:09] And what else am I gonna do?
[00:35:11] Why do I need money?
[00:35:12] I didn't think about people having families and kids.
[00:35:15] Like, you know, you just think like,
[00:35:16] oh, there are guys in the military.
[00:35:18] That's what he does.
[00:35:19] That's all he does.
[00:35:19] I had a similar, I was in my first platoon.
[00:35:22] I think it was my first platoon.
[00:35:23] Or whenever I got paid per diem for the first time.
[00:35:26] Like they had to explain it to me a couple times.
[00:35:28] You know, you're getting, like,
[00:35:30] that was a wild concept.
[00:35:31] Okay, you're going to the desert and here's $1400.
[00:35:34] And I'm like, what's this for?
[00:35:36] And they're like, for your food.
[00:35:37] And I not only make a thousand bucks a month,
[00:35:39] they give me $1400.
[00:35:40] So you're like, wait, but I mean,
[00:35:44] what about when I'm not in the desert?
[00:35:46] I still got to buy food there.
[00:35:47] But yeah, but when you're there,
[00:35:48] we're going to give you money to buy your food.
[00:35:49] I'm like, okay, I'll take it.
[00:35:52] It took a while to comprehend that the whole thing.
[00:35:54] When you got to Buds, was there any challenges
[00:35:57] for you at Buds?
[00:35:59] Yeah, the runs.
[00:36:02] I was a, I was a-
[00:36:03] What did you weigh?
[00:36:04] 230.
[00:36:06] Yeah.
[00:36:07] And not a fast runner.
[00:36:11] I was a great sprinter.
[00:36:12] Yeah.
[00:36:13] You know, I was a fast twitch.
[00:36:14] You're just like fast twitched human.
[00:36:16] And like when we did Frog Hill.
[00:36:19] Dude, I remember one time I was talking to you,
[00:36:20] and you're like, I thought you're like,
[00:36:23] oh, what you, I mean, you're deadlifting that.
[00:36:25] And I was like, dude, I can like, I deadlift.
[00:36:27] The most I've ever deadlifted is like 505 or something.
[00:36:30] And you looked at me like I was scum.
[00:36:32] I was like, damn, that hurt, bro.
[00:36:38] So yeah, you're all fast twitching.
[00:36:40] So the runs kicked your ass.
[00:36:41] Yeah.
[00:36:43] I struggled and I knew I would.
[00:36:44] Cause I, I mean, I struggled in preparation.
[00:36:46] So when I first decided to join the Navy,
[00:36:51] the Marine recruiter actually talked to a seal
[00:36:54] and had the, and had the guy talk to me.
[00:36:57] So I had a phone call with the guy.
[00:36:59] And, and he said,
[00:37:03] well, it sounds like your biggest problem
[00:37:04] is going to be running.
[00:37:05] Cause I'd, all they'd done it, like I ran track and field,
[00:37:08] but I did like, I, the furthest,
[00:37:11] I, the furthest I ever ran was 400 yards,
[00:37:14] 400 meters, right?
[00:37:15] Like that was the furthest I'd ever run in my life.
[00:37:18] I'd never done a mile on a track.
[00:37:20] Never.
[00:37:21] And so, and I hated that.
[00:37:24] Like in football,
[00:37:25] and to be like, take a lap to warm up, right?
[00:37:28] I'm like, I'm smoke.
[00:37:29] So like, what do you mean warm up?
[00:37:31] Like I'm done.
[00:37:32] Like a, come back from a lab.
[00:37:34] Well, what are you kidding me?
[00:37:35] And unfortunately my son inherited that from me.
[00:37:39] So this, this seal sold me.
[00:37:42] So the biggest problem for you is going to be to run.
[00:37:44] You need to be running like 10 miles a day.
[00:37:46] I'm like, I don't really, okay.
[00:37:49] So I'm like, I don't know where I'm going to run 10 miles.
[00:37:51] So I go out in the, like the main street,
[00:37:53] that's all the one that gets from the freeway down to my town.
[00:37:55] And it goes several miles the other way.
[00:37:57] So I clocked it off in my car and it's five miles.
[00:38:01] I'm like, well, I'm just going to run down to the end
[00:38:03] of this thing and back 10 miles a day.
[00:38:05] I didn't even have any shoes.
[00:38:06] Like I, I owned like one pair of shoes.
[00:38:08] They were like top-siders.
[00:38:09] And so I just ran barefoot down concrete streets.
[00:38:13] I'd start running 10 miles a day and I did it.
[00:38:16] I mean, I'm sure I didn't do it every day,
[00:38:18] but I like my memory is it's like, I just did it every day.
[00:38:23] And then when I got, and I, and then I started timing myself
[00:38:30] in the mile and a half because right,
[00:38:31] we had the PRT and I knew I had to hit a certain time.
[00:38:34] And that, that I didn't regret it.
[00:38:36] Like I probably, I probably only beat that qualification time
[00:38:40] like 30 seconds, 20 seconds, something like that.
[00:38:44] Like when I, and then when I went to a school,
[00:38:47] I really focused on running a lot.
[00:38:51] And I did like a couple of 10 Ks.
[00:38:53] And I, I got to where it's running like six and a half
[00:38:55] minute miles and 10 issues and shorts on a road on the street.
[00:38:58] Right.
[00:38:59] So I think the cutoff time in about like seven and a half
[00:39:01] minutes or something and pants and boots on the sand.
[00:39:04] So it was, it was all I could do.
[00:39:06] I mean, I was always in the Goon squad,
[00:39:08] I was in the Goon squad, every run I was in the Goon squad.
[00:39:11] But it was almost always the first guy out
[00:39:12] because it was like bear crawl races or sprints or like
[00:39:16] something like that.
[00:39:16] And like, hey, that's my bag, baby.
[00:39:18] In fact, you remember Frog Hill out of the island.
[00:39:21] Yep.
[00:39:22] It's like you had to do pull ups before the meal
[00:39:23] or you had to do Frog Hill.
[00:39:25] I was so fast at Frog Hill and I, and I like anybody else.
[00:39:30] I'm going through Bud's scared to death that I'm getting
[00:39:32] kicked out every, every day, every day, like every second.
[00:39:35] It's like they're about to figure out,
[00:39:36] I'm a machine here and I'm getting tossed, right?
[00:39:39] And so I just like a real, just keep your head down.
[00:39:42] Like the most humble time of my life was, was Bud's
[00:39:45] and I wasn't going to bring any attention to myself.
[00:39:48] And I don't think I really realized I did it
[00:39:51] because I think they had kind of groups or something.
[00:39:53] And I, I mean, I just smoked everybody in my class.
[00:39:57] Like I, I think I was, I was almost all the way back down
[00:40:00] before anybody got to the top.
[00:40:02] And so then there's this one instructor who decided
[00:40:05] I must be sandbagging the runs
[00:40:06] because look how good he is at running, right?
[00:40:08] And so, so he just turned on me and like, you know,
[00:40:10] it's just beat down boy.
[00:40:12] And then they got to where they were dropping me
[00:40:15] for pushups when they started the class
[00:40:17] and I still had to meet the time.
[00:40:19] And then after a while I was like,
[00:40:20] you have to beat everybody or you're still going
[00:40:22] to the surf zone.
[00:40:23] So I had to, what was the second phase?
[00:40:26] Like 40 pushups or something?
[00:40:27] I don't know, I don't remember.
[00:40:28] I think it's, I think it's like 20, 40, 60 or something
[00:40:30] like that.
[00:40:31] That's probably the phases.
[00:40:32] And so whatever it was in second phase,
[00:40:33] I had to do the pushups and then I sprint
[00:40:35] and I would still win.
[00:40:37] And like, I was really good at that.
[00:40:40] And I just sucked it at the run.
[00:40:42] And you'd barely passed the four mile time runs?
[00:40:44] Barely.
[00:40:45] I mean, every run was like five, four, three,
[00:40:49] and me diving across the finish line.
[00:40:51] Like, I mean, in fact, one of the instructors,
[00:40:55] because I was pretty good at everything else.
[00:40:57] Like some of the calisthenics stuff,
[00:40:58] like flutter kicks forever, like I wouldn't,
[00:41:00] like that's just too enduring for me.
[00:41:02] Like I couldn't, but, but I was always like,
[00:41:09] I'm pretty sure it's the biggest,
[00:41:11] but I was definitely like one of the top two.
[00:41:13] Yeah, two threes, a big dude to be going through.
[00:41:15] Well, I finished at 185.
[00:41:18] Oh, damn.
[00:41:20] And they, I started buds at 174.
[00:41:22] I graduated buds at 185.
[00:41:24] Holy.
[00:41:25] So you and I met in the middle.
[00:41:26] Yeah.
[00:41:27] I think they called me like the cyborg gorilla or something.
[00:41:30] Cause like I lost all my muscle mass in my torso,
[00:41:34] but my arms didn't get smaller.
[00:41:36] So I looked like a gorilla.
[00:41:38] Like I was just, I was just a weird looking thing.
[00:41:40] But you know, I could do like anybody, like you graduate buds,
[00:41:43] I could do like 600 pushups in a row.
[00:41:45] Right?
[00:41:46] Now I remember going to the gym the first time after buds
[00:41:51] and I couldn't bench two plates.
[00:41:54] And I was literally, I almost cried.
[00:41:58] Like I was sitting there going, oh God.
[00:42:00] Like I had tears rolling up in my eyes.
[00:42:02] I was like, I could go outside.
[00:42:03] And I like, oh my God.
[00:42:05] You know, cause I mean, I wasn't super strong,
[00:42:09] but I was, I mean, definitely like well into the 300s
[00:42:11] in high school, right?
[00:42:12] So I expected to be stronger.
[00:42:14] And I'm like, I can't bench my body weight.
[00:42:17] Right?
[00:42:18] I'm weak.
[00:42:19] But it all, yeah, obviously it comes back pretty fast.
[00:42:22] Yeah.
[00:42:23] Do you remember when they started talking
[00:42:25] about medium twitch muscle?
[00:42:27] Do you remember the timeframe that that happened?
[00:42:30] Because I remember reading about.
[00:42:32] Intermediate fibers man?
[00:42:34] I guess maybe.
[00:42:35] I just remember I was never,
[00:42:37] I wasn't like the fastest guy,
[00:42:38] but I wasn't like the most endurance guy.
[00:42:41] So I'm like the loser that I couldn't win a sprint
[00:42:44] and I couldn't run, I couldn't win
[00:42:45] the freaking four mile time run.
[00:42:47] Right.
[00:42:48] And I figured out eventually when I started hearing
[00:42:50] about like intermediate twitch muscle,
[00:42:52] that there's certain people that have this thing
[00:42:54] and that was me.
[00:42:55] And I was like, oh yeah.
[00:42:56] Cause like I could put on a rucksack and just go forever.
[00:42:58] Right.
[00:42:59] And then when I did jujitsu,
[00:43:01] like I have really good endurance.
[00:43:03] Yeah.
[00:43:05] Have you seen me get tired?
[00:43:06] No.
[00:43:07] So I've been training with him for like 10 years.
[00:43:08] Never seen me get tired.
[00:43:09] I remember training with you
[00:43:10] and like watching you roll guys
[00:43:12] and you just had like sweat pouring off of it.
[00:43:14] Yeah.
[00:43:15] Like breathing through your nose
[00:43:17] and like just calmly mashing people.
[00:43:19] I'm like, that killed me in jits.
[00:43:22] Like I, cause I mean I'm good for like three minutes.
[00:43:25] I'm then if my, if I haven't won in three minutes,
[00:43:29] Like by the time when you do like three minute rounds or whatever after class by the time
[00:43:35] I get to like I mean I might as well be rolling with the five-year-old girl because I have
[00:43:38] nothing I have no strength whatsoever.
[00:43:41] Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:42] But I just didn't have that that explosive you know again like max deadlift like I'd
[00:43:48] be embarrassed to be like dude I'm just pathetic.
[00:43:51] Yeah.
[00:43:52] And that's just the way it is.
[00:43:53] I mean it's just a different you get you get your certain genetic thing and that's what
[00:43:57] you're going to you can work on it a little bit.
[00:43:59] Yeah.
[00:44:00] You can get to do a lot of push-ups instead of a lot of bench I guess apparently.
[00:44:03] Yeah, yeah.
[00:44:04] Yeah.
[00:44:05] Well I mean you I mean nobody nobody is like 100% of any fiber right and like in different
[00:44:12] muscles of your body you're going to have different makeup supplements so like everybody
[00:44:18] everybody couldn't train to some degree to get better at reasonably good at something
[00:44:23] if you really weren't it's just like any it's like your mental aptitude.
[00:44:25] But like you would have 0% chance of being a good marathon runner.
[00:44:29] Yeah.
[00:44:30] You here's how smart I am though when I was in medical school and residency I knew that
[00:44:36] the smart thing to do then was to start doing triathlons because I was going to get good
[00:44:42] at this damn endurance thing finally right so when I was in college I worked full time
[00:44:47] and I went to school I worked part time and but it is a lot of it for part time it's like
[00:44:52] 30 hours a week and then I went to school full time and you know for half of it I was
[00:44:58] married and had kids and whatever so like I was burning the candle at both ends you
[00:45:04] know staying up late for get papers and whatever finals and all that and so all I really had
[00:45:11] time to do was run so I'd come home and I ran and it started like running three miles
[00:45:16] and then it's four and then it's five and then six and then I said you know I'm going
[00:45:20] to do a marathon because you know whatever I've never been good at endurance I'm going
[00:45:25] to get good at endurance so I did a marathon brutal like I have the type of endurance where
[00:45:33] like if I go slow I can go forever but I don't I can't go fast like if I go fast and I go
[00:45:39] if I go anaerobic once and hit like that black gas or threshold like I'm done like I'm done
[00:45:45] in fact I did that on one of the triathlons so it's anyway I did that and then I started
[00:45:50] doing well I'm going to do triathlons and so I started with the super frog did you how
[00:45:54] much weight did you have to lose a bunch of weight or did you lose weight or you're not
[00:45:57] or just go Clydesdale yeah it's doing Clydesdale and something happened to me at some point
[00:46:03] my life is after the teams so it was during college I think my body weight like settled
[00:46:09] out around 240 give or take five pounds right nothing I did change that and to this day nothing
[00:46:16] changes that I can starve myself like I can lose weight for a little while but like give
[00:46:22] me two days and I'm right back to 240 I can be like kind of doughy and soft and out of
[00:46:27] shape and only 240 I can be ripped and like nobody fat 240 it's like that's just what
[00:46:32] I went and so I was running marathons at that at that weight and so I did the super frog
[00:46:40] and because you know it's the original like throwback to the teens like it'd be cool
[00:46:46] and so I and they have a cutoff time right like if you don't finish by certain time
[00:46:50] and it's basically a half triathlon right yeah yeah it's a half iron man so it's 1.2
[00:46:56] mile swim 56 mile bike ride and half marathon and so I do it and if you don't make the cutoff
[00:47:05] time then you're you're DNF right did not finish same as somebody who drops out I made
[00:47:11] it by like three minutes I think it was like seven and a half hours and there's dudes doing
[00:47:15] this thing this guy's doing it like two and a half hours right and so I finish and barely
[00:47:21] make it three years later I've been doing triathlons the whole time right I ride my
[00:47:26] bike to work or ride my bike back and forth to school the hospital or whatever you know
[00:47:32] running whenever I can I'd never really practice a swim because I actually just did side-strike
[00:47:37] because my side-strike was as fast as my crawl anyway so I just did that and you can do that
[00:47:42] forever obviously like after buds like you get so you get so efficient at that movement
[00:47:47] I could go 20 miles today probably and so I do it again three years later two minutes
[00:47:54] faster after all that training like this like when I was training it when I was training
[00:48:04] it Odin Neto school do you know yeah so it's training at his school and I was it was like
[00:48:12] incorporating the jet training into my bike ride like to like their nose bike to the hospital
[00:48:18] and then leaving the hospital and stopping by there and then going and so that it like
[00:48:22] five or six miles to my commute and and I still gasped all the time and I was like what the
[00:48:30] hell like because I didn't understand the physiology at the time I'm like how can I still be
[00:48:34] gassing like all it like I'm doing all this endurance work and I'm still gassing on the
[00:48:38] mat like I remember the first time he had us do like he put out like whatever the five
[00:48:43] or six black belts and it's like you're gonna roll two minutes here and then and then the
[00:48:47] last guy rolled with this him I mean he just like thought yeah fall over it thought me at
[00:48:52] fall like I couldn't do like a dream for like a guy that owns a school that's a black belt
[00:48:57] and Odie probably ways what do you think Odin Neto would 70 yeah maybe 170 yeah so he's
[00:49:02] just like oh I get to beat up this seat yeah I always try to keep it on the download it
[00:49:08] has a seal but it gets out eventually right and then the soon as you're just a jacked 240
[00:49:12] pound dude yeah they won't be with a white belt on right yeah Jeff Glover Jeff Glover
[00:49:19] and I've seen this now he the best the worst I call the best the worst but it's the easiest
[00:49:27] for him to go against a guy that's big and strong like he he is if he sees a guy that's
[00:49:33] big and strong he's like oh yeah I'm gonna have fun with them and I've watched him do
[00:49:36] it watch like big jack guys come in and he just is all over him and you see like another
[00:49:40] guy that's more his size or a guy that's you know long and lanky or whatever it's more
[00:49:45] trouble for him but a big jack guy he's like I got this fool yeah he didn't he did like
[00:49:50] some sort of exhibition here or something with him another guy like yeah he's bar I mean
[00:49:56] all kinds of stuff he's like watching two snakes yeah I mean he's just like this I mean
[00:50:00] this rolled forever like from yeah from position to position position attempt attempt attempt
[00:50:06] just like I can't even follow that freaking nuts alright so you get done with buds did
[00:50:13] you do get rolled at all no that's good and you're you're what you're 18 19 years old
[00:50:20] so I technically yeah so I was I was 19 because I graduated and technically because we actually
[00:50:27] had Christmas break before we graduated we should have graduated so we're really done
[00:50:32] with buds and I think we had like a 13 mile time to run around left or something or it
[00:50:37] wasn't timed right it wasn't was there was some time to it but it wasn't the same as
[00:50:41] is like yeah four mile I think it was more like you better not you better pass it type
[00:50:44] thing yeah but there's I think it was a time like three hours yeah I think there was a
[00:50:48] time limit but it wasn't three hours for it was it wasn't like the same consistent yeah
[00:50:52] like everything else was like whatever the that's that same time I think it was seven
[00:50:57] and a half minute miles was like the cutoff on all that stuff and that I think was a little
[00:51:01] longer but so that's all we had to do is come back and do that and then we were graduating
[00:51:06] so so I graduated technically in January of 90 okay and then you had to go to the airport
[00:51:13] in March I would have turned 20 okay so yeah it's not end of night yeah then we went to
[00:51:18] we were the first class that they sent us a class oh really they hadn't done it in a
[00:51:22] really long time man did we get in trouble oh yeah oh yeah we get and we were there the
[00:51:27] first time anybody died in jump school really and the dude I mean he was like from here probably
[00:51:35] to probably to the mats like that far away from me like I heard that he just wrapped
[00:51:42] in what happened to him we're doing combat equipment and he I don't know if his exit
[00:51:49] was bad or whatever but he ended up inverted with his leg cotton and and the risers and
[00:51:58] and he cigarette rolled to some degree and he pulled his reserve but his ruck was on
[00:52:03] top of it because it had flopped on it so he's 19 he's from Texas and he just I mean
[00:52:09] I heard that dude hit and then something like just like after you shoot a deer or something
[00:52:13] you hear the right that I remember that so clearly and then anyway we you know we'd go
[00:52:22] in the chow hall there and you know how the the army kids are taking that school seriously
[00:52:27] and we're we're cocky as shit like on you can't whatever this is a joke for us and so
[00:52:33] we'd sit around and smoke and joke in the in the chow for like an hour and like you know
[00:52:38] keep going back and whatever and so this Stars and Stripe reporter comes around he starts
[00:52:43] trying to ask everybody questions army kids are you know eating like a robot and then
[00:52:48] bolt out the door right and and so we're like hey I won't tell you what happened so we told
[00:52:56] him that we told him that that the guy didn't hook up because he was going to DOR at the
[00:53:02] door and the instructor pushed him out and of course we had no idea what went on and
[00:53:08] they printed it and they said oh my as told by any Navy personnel and so like then our
[00:53:13] whole class gets called up in front of the head of the school like if you don't tell
[00:53:18] me who did this throwing all of you out of course no one's gonna say anything right
[00:53:23] I remember like all right throw us all out that's better than yeah getting rid of one
[00:53:27] of our guys right better than being a rat right and so nobody said anything the school shut
[00:53:31] down for like two weeks and we just got like hammered on like all the time like all day
[00:53:35] every day they're trying to break out and now the dude ended up printing or traction
[00:53:39] effort but yeah the first time anybody died so there's a couple weeks there had to have
[00:53:43] been other people that died at airborne school they told us is the first time anybody's ever
[00:53:47] burned in that seems impossible it does they put out thousands and thousands of paratroopers
[00:53:54] every week now maybe it's the first guy that died in a while or something like that maybe
[00:53:59] but they did they shut us down they shut the school down we're gonna get fact checked on
[00:54:02] that one yeah we they shut the school down and we did I mean just like nothing for like
[00:54:08] two weeks and then when we finally jocked up to go again they were still super edgy
[00:54:13] oh yeah and we set like we set jocked up and combat equipment for like six hours waiting
[00:54:18] 100% to get in to get in the plane and jump out for five seconds yeah it was it was it
[00:54:25] wasn't a cool fun a cool time so you end up checking in it you go to team five yeah and
[00:54:30] this is what 1990 now 1990 yeah STT what we called it then yeah and so that's QT and that's
[00:54:37] at the team yeah every team did their own yeah yeah that's what I went through yeah you
[00:54:43] would have known um you were what 177 177 what class 3 or what 163 164 164 yeah yeah new
[00:54:52] guy always so you get your first platoon any any any big deal from STT pretty straightforward
[00:55:01] no we did we did they just hand you out an M60 and so here you go yeah you're a jacket
[00:55:05] was what you do with me yeah because I got I I I hate you know I hated that M60 and I
[00:55:12] don't want to carry a little poodle weapon pink and ding ding I like the spring sound
[00:55:17] like you know cap gun I want a real gun man I loved the 60 and a super mechanical right
[00:55:23] like I grew up like working on everything and like super mechanical so I was really good
[00:55:27] at clearing the jams and knowing how to you know work the weapon really well and I really
[00:55:31] enjoyed it hell yeah oh yeah then you so that's what you get your first platoon yeah and first
[00:55:37] lieutenant rep 60 first lieutenant rep get some yeah and actually halfway through my
[00:55:44] first platoon I became the department lead as a new guy right on and then and then I was
[00:55:51] like always first lieutenant for my other two platoon just motorhead your motorhead yeah
[00:55:58] so you're getting in there so we and you're going on deployment I mean what's work up
[00:56:05] like what are you guys focused on what's the big mission I know I'm when I was you know
[00:56:10] for my early platoons it was always like we were preparing for like one big mission that
[00:56:14] we would pray would happen like we wouldn't we as much as I prayed for war which I did
[00:56:19] yeah I couldn't have dreamed of like a two decade long war like I thought if we're lucky
[00:56:27] we'll get some kind of a one mission you know there'll be something will happen and if we're
[00:56:33] in the right spot at the right time maybe we'll get to do one thing yeah that's how
[00:56:37] scarce it was yeah people don't know that you're like competing like used car salesman
[00:56:41] for any work that comes out for your special forces are it's like you have to have somebody
[00:56:46] jockey and to try to get the work was Gardner in your first platoon no he was in he's in
[00:56:52] my sister you guys get like rolled up or something yeah yeah my my 21st birthday to walk I can't
[00:57:03] remember I can't remember any of the names of the bars but we walk into this one bar
[00:57:06] it's really common one and Jason was standing up on the bar when I when I walked in choked
[00:57:15] a beer and then like slammed the bottle around why because I can't I'm like I'm gonna like
[00:57:23] this guy so that wasn't my birthday I take it back that's like when we first that was
[00:57:29] just like a Tuesday night that was like the first that's like the first time I think I'd
[00:57:34] been out in town really you know it wasn't a big deal because I'd already obviously you
[00:57:38] could go drink at any age but my 21st birthday is like oh so the whole platoon well first
[00:57:44] of course yeah they were rigorous tape me and throw me in shit river so and it was so
[00:57:50] I was so stupid because we had like a trailer right divided in half and P.I. did you guys
[00:57:56] have the same thing I didn't avoid the P.I. missed it oh yeah right because of the mountain
[00:58:00] too but yeah so we had the just like a regular trailer and it was like partitioned and there
[00:58:04] was a platoon space on each side and they had like a regular half padlock on on the outside
[00:58:12] and so we were walking up we were walking up to our trailer and our sister platoon
[00:58:20] was in there was in their side and my LPO goes up and you know like puts their has been
[00:58:26] like while they're while they're in these lock and so I think I like locking them in
[00:58:29] right and then we have our platoon meeting and then he goes and then at the end of the
[00:58:35] meeting he looks around he says hey whatever you guys do I don't want you to rigorous tape
[00:58:44] buck up and throw me shit river and I look around and every single guy's holding a roll
[00:58:50] of rigorous tape and I totally missed this the whole time I'm like oh you gotta be kidding
[00:58:56] me man now I realize oh that side's locked that's what that was about and it was just
[00:59:05] a shit fight man I mean just like 45 minutes and finally got just grabbed my balls and
[00:59:12] just started squeezing my balls every year like that's the fight ender okay alright everyone
[00:59:17] is a tough guy tape me up guys grabs your nuts and start squeezing them yeah and anyways
[00:59:22] and yes so when we go we go out in the town and I don't even remember how it started like
[00:59:29] I don't even hardly remember the fight at all but I like knocked some short patrol guy out
[00:59:36] and just went to the bar because I was drunk more on and like I'll be fine like he's unconscious
[00:59:42] would you so I go in the bar and then when we come out of the bar they're like there
[00:59:47] he is and like all these people start swarming up and try to run and then like a hit some
[00:59:51] other guy while I was trying to run away and they finally got us and then or got me and
[00:59:57] then a handcuff me in front and I'm like you know even a drunk guy's like that's a dumb
[01:00:05] idea and so I so I start walking to the patty wagon it's like a Toyota truck with like the
[01:00:11] built on kind of camper or whatever like a patty wagon thing and and the dude that I'd
[01:00:21] the tour patrol guy that I'd hit was like standing there holding the door smirking and
[01:00:24] said like said something smart and I fucking hit him again with both hands in front of
[01:00:28] him like he he went out cold and hit his head on the bumper and I was like well that's
[01:00:32] really good so then they don't recognize how stupid we can be yeah yeah they just don't
[01:00:38] know yeah so then they throw me in the patty wagon and I'm drunk I just like through the
[01:00:43] wagon spin and I'm so drunk and so I lay down on my back and put my feet in the corners
[01:00:49] and then when we get to the jail so wouldn't when I get in there Jason's in there with
[01:00:52] me and he's like hey man I'm like hey and they like he I don't know what he was in
[01:00:56] there for I don't even remember and then they get us to the police station and they pull
[01:01:01] everybody out and I'm like I'm not getting out and they they're trying to pull me out
[01:01:05] they can't get me out and so they lock the door and they go in and they come back and
[01:01:10] try to get me out again I won't get out and then they bring out this big their big tough
[01:01:16] guy short patrol guy whatever and he's gonna get me out and so they put him in and lock
[01:01:19] the door and and I I managed to like put some pressure on a stroller and like pull him
[01:01:26] in to me and he and it was like essentially breaking his wrist backwards right because
[01:01:32] he and he couldn't get off of it because like the way his body position like he was
[01:01:35] just half his body weight was on his wrist and it was inverted and I'm just pulling
[01:01:38] on him and he's screaming they let him out and then I'm still laying there and then all
[01:01:44] of a sudden I hear this maybe 45 minutes go by and I hear my officer go hey buck I was
[01:01:50] like yeah let's go my god and I get out they unhand cuff me and and I went back to barracks
[01:01:56] with him and then you know your your senior chief whatever goes and smooths things over
[01:02:00] the next day gives a guy a case of beer or whatever like this is stupidest time you know
[01:02:06] like we like all of our excitement was self-induced and and I was in for the first goal for right
[01:02:12] like it the so the first golf or shut my work up down was that your first work my first
[01:02:19] work up yeah and and we were we were so we got the cool thing was because of that whatever
[01:02:26] the they thought the mission set was they we became a freefall platoon so the first thing
[01:02:30] I did was go to freefall school I think I only had like two or three more jumps whatever
[01:02:36] you get in STT was like the only other jumps I had other than jump school so I never did
[01:02:41] static line again right I just and unless it's in the water right for duck or something
[01:02:45] um yeah so we we uh we got our our work up gut I think work ups are like a year and a
[01:02:54] half then right yeah and they get we get shut down to buddy here got compressed and then
[01:03:00] we didn't end up going to go for anyways because I think maybe it was like half over like you
[01:03:06] know how limited that whole thing was and so then we deployed to the PI and then a mountain
[01:03:10] penitubo blue when we're out there and that that was a very interesting what you guys
[01:03:16] do on that just like provide as much security yeah yeah so we so we were so a lot of people
[01:03:24] know this but like when that mount when mountain penitubo blue probably because it blew there
[01:03:30] was a typhoon at the same time and so you know Clark airbase the Air Force base which
[01:03:37] was 45 minute drive or something way they had boulders the size of this room coming
[01:03:43] down from miles high in the sky just like landing on buildings and cars and whatever
[01:03:49] and uh that place was demolished and but we just got all this ash we got some rocks but
[01:03:54] like we get all this ash and the ash had a ton of metal ore in it and it was mixed in
[01:03:59] with the typhoon so you have like 70 80 mile an hour winds with rain and then this ash
[01:04:05] with all this metal in it and it was and it was sticking it sticks to everything and it
[01:04:10] looks like kind of grayish snow but it's super heavy and it collapses there it's like all
[01:04:14] the buildings are collapsing like our our our pbs and our and our peers are floating peers
[01:04:20] were sinking and all our buildings are collapsing so they're like there's like the first night
[01:04:25] of this thing and they're like hey we all need to go down to the unit and like save all
[01:04:30] the so we go and we you know we we we don't even have shovels we have bode ores right
[01:04:35] and uh and we're just and like a boat ore of this stuff probably weighed 30 pounds
[01:04:40] like it was just super compact and so we go and shovel all that off and then we're going
[01:04:45] up on the roofs and we're trying to save you know the buildings we got up on the periloft
[01:04:51] and uh there's no light right you can't see anything we're wearing flight suits with
[01:04:55] scuba mask and you could shine a flashlight and you could about see your feet pre head
[01:05:00] lamp right it's so crazy no one had thought of head lamps yeah and so I get up to the
[01:05:05] top of the periloft and these guys are going hey over here over here over here and sound
[01:05:09] like I'm walking their way and all of a sudden I stop and I'm like I feel like I'm I feel
[01:05:15] like I'm going the wrong I'm trying to remember what the building was like I was like I feel
[01:05:19] like I'm going the wrong way and I pull out a flashlight and I look at my feet and one
[01:05:23] of my feet it's like one of my toes are hanging over the edge like one more step I was gonna
[01:05:27] fall 60 feet and so anyway we're shoving all this off and then we go into like one of
[01:05:32] the big barn kind of things and we're shelling off and like buildings are collapsing while
[01:05:38] we're on them and we're like jumping off whatever and so then we all kind of show up in this
[01:05:44] and this barn has like the big I beams supporting the roof right and we're in there and somebody's
[01:05:51] like I think maybe we should get out of here what if this one collapses and I look up and
[01:05:54] I'm like there's no way this is gonna and we're like we all dive out like the doors
[01:06:00] you know it's like this wide the doors open this wide like 20 guys get through that thing
[01:06:05] in like five seconds you know and the whole thing collapses and so so there was no power
[01:06:09] for like six weeks there's no water there is no anything and there were bodies laying
[01:06:15] in the ditches all over the place of course in town they have like generators going and
[01:06:19] everything's going like two days later they're like up and running nothing ever happened
[01:06:24] and then we had like the they call them the NPA like the the Vietnam Equivalent or the
[01:06:31] Philippine equivalent of the Vietnamese Communist I guess and they start trying to infiltrate
[01:06:38] the base and like get equipment and all this stuff and we were closing the base because
[01:06:45] there was so much damage and the negotiations had failed I think we offered them like ten
[01:06:49] million dollars and they went like a hundred million dollars and I'm sorry we're out of
[01:06:52] here so we're gonna close the base anyway and so they started trying to come on the
[01:06:55] base and so we were like patrolling against them and like you know arresting some of those
[01:07:00] guys and stuff and I was like they're kind of like the closest thing to combat that we
[01:07:05] saw you know and we had like drug interdiction with the FBI and stuff and I was like the
[01:07:12] most exciting thing I did which is kind of one of the reasons I got out is like you know
[01:07:17] it's just like the same training trips over and over again doing the same stuff over and
[01:07:20] over again it's like I don't think we're ever gonna go to war again like I'm gonna
[01:07:24] go do something else you know and then of course while I'm in medical school 9-11 happens
[01:07:28] so you did you did a couple more platoons of team five and like you said like you're
[01:07:32] it's the 90s and you're just going through work up it's always fun I mean yeah it's
[01:07:36] super fun yeah Hollywood seals what we call it you know it's like it was like it was super
[01:07:41] fun yeah and you're well for me I was always like thought the big mission was coming and
[01:07:46] so I was always just like hey you gotta be ready in my mind I was trying to be ready
[01:07:51] I wish I had your confidence about that I was like we had Bill Clinton in the White House
[01:07:54] I'm like we're never going to war kidding me so you do a couple more platoons and then
[01:08:00] you're like all right did you when you when you decided to get out did you know you wanted
[01:08:05] to become a doctor no so what was your plan when you got out well so I started dating
[01:08:12] this girl who became my first wife like after after my first platoon I dated her during
[01:08:21] my second work up and then I deployed and then I came back and I was supposed to do
[01:08:25] like nine months of shore duty you know like work in the department start school kind of
[01:08:30] transition out and then I got thrown in a platoon because somebody got hurt and so kind of deployed
[01:08:36] actually until supposed to be until the day I got out but it ended up being like four or
[01:08:39] five days after I got I was actually technically out and I came back anyway so I she was in
[01:08:48] physical therapy school so wait so you're dating each other you got married we're dating
[01:08:52] okay you're dating and she's figure out this way you're you date this you start dating
[01:08:56] this girl you figure you're gonna get gonna get out but you end up getting thrown into
[01:08:59] a platoon you do the deployment you come home you have no plan and you're out of the Navy
[01:09:04] boom right okay and she's going to physical therapy school yes so she by the time I came back
[01:09:10] for my second deployment she is like three months out of grad school and she was working
[01:09:14] at San Diego Children's Hospital and and I used to take her textbooks on deployment
[01:09:20] and read them because I like I was just interested in you know physiology and anatomy and like
[01:09:26] I anything to make me bigger and stronger and faster and whatever better and so I felt
[01:09:31] like I didn't interest in that but I didn't you know I'd never done well in school I was
[01:09:35] convinced that I was dumb really until I until I got in the name of like an A school I did
[01:09:39] really well like I top of my class and then like I'd really well academically and buds
[01:09:43] and so I thought well maybe I'm not stupid maybe I just like never really applied myself
[01:09:48] but we'll see right so you go like you know I have a GED so I can't get into any college
[01:09:53] I have to go to at least a year of junior college probably two and so I went there and
[01:09:59] like started setting the curve in every class that I thought maybe is gonna be like jadjee
[01:10:04] or something like an athletic trainer maybe a physical therapist if like things are really
[01:10:09] worked out great for me and to to apply to physical therapy school you have to like have
[01:10:14] 2000 volunteer hours right well that's that's a year full-time work right so part-time work
[01:10:20] that gets a couple of years and so I'm like well I get I'll start getting my volunteer
[01:10:23] hours and they hired me after I'd volunteered there for maybe a week and they're like we
[01:10:29] don't you can work for us and so then I worked as a physical therapy assistant at San Diego
[01:10:34] Sports Medicine Center the whole Thomas in college and that was like a healthcare mecca
[01:10:41] they had everything you know they had orthopedic surgeons they had sports medicine guys they
[01:10:46] had DOs they had MDs they had podiatrists they had massage therapists PT's athletic
[01:10:52] trainers so we had everything and I I got to know all of the people and got to see everybody's
[01:11:01] work and I'm standing in the hallway with a couple of doctors because they're about
[01:11:07] my age right because I because I'd you know been in the teams first so they're maybe two
[01:11:13] or three years older than me and I got to be friends with them and we're standing out
[01:11:18] on the hallway one day and and they're telling me you should go to medical school pump the
[01:11:26] brace there sparky like I didn't like I'm like I'm even close to medical school and
[01:11:32] so they're trying to convince me that I can get in a medical school and I'm like no frickin
[01:11:36] way I can get I'm getting in a medical school and then the the doctor that owned it Lee
[01:11:41] Ryce he's out here still and he said he steps out of the office and he goes Kirk I didn't
[01:11:47] even know he knew my name right it's a Kirk the question isn't whether you can get in
[01:11:52] question is would you go if you got in and I said of course he goes well then you kind
[01:11:57] of have to try don't you I was like shit trapped you yeah I was like right and then I ended
[01:12:03] up going to work for him when I got to the Navy like my first year in the Navy I went
[01:12:06] back to his practice he had a concierge practice in Point Loma out here and yeah but that that's
[01:12:13] how that came about man and I I mean I was fully planning to be an orthopedic surgeon
[01:12:19] because I'm like a mechanical dude and I like I like this succinctly broken not broken yeah
[01:12:24] hey this is broken and put some bolts and screws and then plates and it's not gonna be
[01:12:29] broken anymore and that's it and then I'm gonna go on and do it again I don't want to look
[01:12:33] at anybody's frickin anion gap or like care about what medications are online I doesn't
[01:12:38] interest me I want to go fix things and and then in and the Navy you have to do an operational
[01:12:47] tour before they let you finish residency so you do like your first year and then they
[01:12:52] you have to go to the fleet if you don't if you don't so wait sir do you already gotten
[01:12:56] commissioned or were you planning to go back in the Navy what was the whole story about
[01:12:59] yeah I totally skipped that part yeah so when so when I decided to apply for medical school
[01:13:04] pre-internet so I went to the bookstore and started looking through the Kaplan books to
[01:13:09] see like what schools would I be competitive for with my with my GPA and my MCAT and all
[01:13:13] that and that's when I found out that the Navy had his own school I was like no way
[01:13:18] are you kidding me and so I look into it's like they'll pay me to go to medical school
[01:13:24] instead of the other way around and of course I'm married and have a kid and have a kid
[01:13:28] on the way like well that makes a lot more sense right like I wasn't excited to go on
[01:13:34] the Navy trust me like I you know I was in the team that's a good fit for the team but
[01:13:38] I wasn't a good fit for the Navy I knew that and I was like all right well I'll do this
[01:13:44] right now and I knew that there was you know this eight year commitment afterwards and
[01:13:49] I was like well I'll go back to the teams for a while and I'll like give back to the
[01:13:52] community who saved me from prison or you know whatever I was gonna end up if I if I
[01:13:57] didn't have you know something to channel my anger with right and so I I did you know
[01:14:08] when you do your operational to she got commissioned in 2000 go to OIS Connecticut basically the
[01:14:15] knife and fork school knife and fork school they gave me some kind of award there I'm
[01:14:21] so ridiculous I don't I think I did like I participated in like 25% of that school like
[01:14:27] they couldn't make pants for me I have really big legs and kind of a normal waist and they
[01:14:31] kept making they're like trying to make khaki pants like from scratch like these girls and
[01:14:37] they were ridiculous I mean never and it was just like they kept trying all this stuff
[01:14:41] so I never had a uniform and I'd be like well I gotta go to the I gotta go to the uniform
[01:14:45] store again and that's all I did for like three weeks was like try to get a uniform
[01:14:49] to fit and then and so and then they give me some sort of award is comical and then
[01:14:57] go to medical school and then from there I did you know there was some hoopla I won't
[01:15:06] get into but ended up coming back to San Diego to do internship which is the first year residency
[01:15:14] essentially and then you have to go out to the fleet do that Balboa I did it Balboa yeah
[01:15:19] and the you do that and if and then after that year if you just say hey I just want
[01:15:27] to come back as soon as possible then they just send you out to some fleet job you're
[01:15:30] probably going to go 30 seconds to be on the ship or something right but if you go to
[01:15:37] flight school you can be a flight surgeon you go to dive school and and you know most
[01:15:41] school in Connecticut and then you can obviously go back to like our units or dive unit or
[01:15:45] something like that so I was like I'll do DMO and I'll go back to the teams for a while
[01:15:53] then I'll come back and finish residency and I went to dive school and then at the
[01:16:01] end of it there weren't there weren't any orders for the teams so they put me on at
[01:16:07] the submarine rescue unit out here on the end of point limo okay no not it's I'm sorry
[01:16:14] it's at the end of North Island now and that was like a policy job really because a lot
[01:16:21] of people don't realize this but like every country that has submarines like they all
[01:16:29] they all have this agreement that will will rescue each other submarines even our enemies
[01:16:33] like China Russia doesn't matter like your submarine goes down on our waters and it's
[01:16:37] saveable we'll use our system to save your guys because technically these systems can
[01:16:43] go anywhere in the world but with a realistic time when there's probably not in realistic
[01:16:48] to like fly it over there and set everything up so you're gonna be much better off of the
[01:16:53] country that you're closest to saves them and so then you have to make all these agreements
[01:16:57] like well who whose patients are they gonna be whose dive tables are we're gonna use we
[01:17:01] have to recompress them like what like what's gonna be our product and so that's all we
[01:17:05] did is travel around the world and meet endless meetings and come up with new policy and then
[01:17:12] then I had the opportunity to either go back to the hospital or go to the teams I was like
[01:17:20] I really feel like I should do that and so then I go back to the teams and that's right
[01:17:25] when they called it I think they were calling it they're still calling it the human performance
[01:17:29] program and then switch the tactical asset program and so I got there right when they
[01:17:34] were funding the build out of that clinic nice of course I was a perfect fit for that
[01:17:39] some freaking PT clinics like duh like I did this for I did this all through college
[01:17:44] like I know what I'm doing so and then like and there's a great time like I got to be
[01:17:47] there when we hired everybody like when we hired the first you know the first athletic
[01:17:52] trainer the first PT the first nutritionist the first strength and conditioning coach
[01:17:55] like which is crazy to think about everything that you're just saying is the first the first
[01:17:59] the first the first yeah in 2009 have any of this stuff yeah like it was just like your
[01:18:03] PT was whatever your CO or whatever your exo was into so your exo like to run and swim
[01:18:09] guess what you were doing for PT like run swim swim run run if you got injured it was
[01:18:14] like yeah like you dealt with it like figured out whatever your corpsmen could do for you
[01:18:19] because you weren't going to drive across the bridge and go to rehab at Pete freaking
[01:18:24] Balboa yeah and even if you do that what are they rehabbing a sailor at Balboa for rehabbing
[01:18:30] him to like get out of the Navy right the medical retirement right that's what they're
[01:18:35] rehabbing him for in the teams that guys want to go back to work right like I'm hurt you
[01:18:39] make me better now right yeah I've got to go to Nile in two weeks make me better right
[01:18:43] now right and that's the other thing you're traveling so much like how much rehab do you
[01:18:47] really have unless you're going to get pulled out of your platoon but you might as well
[01:18:50] die before you do that like just let your arm fall off like maybe you'll still be able
[01:18:54] to make it yeah that that happened with stump so stump came over and saw me when he's getting
[01:18:59] out uh-huh and he's like I didn't know him I knew who I knew who he was and and he he
[01:19:07] comes over and he's like hey you know I'm getting out like two days and everybody keeps
[01:19:11] telling me you should look at my record so here it is so he gives me some records like
[01:19:16] paper thin and I open it and his and his discharge physical was like good to go everything's
[01:19:22] good I'm sitting there I'm like didn't you get shot he's like yeah like you know now
[01:19:28] that's in here he's like does that matter I'm like yeah that matters like I said regards
[01:19:36] of how you feel now if you start having some serious problems and you need surgery revision
[01:19:41] like big care like that's you know what what if you know what what if and so he's he's
[01:19:49] like oh okay and so then I check into it I'm like you're gonna have to stand and not he
[01:19:54] was pissed man oh sure he ended up ended up I did I just saw him recently and I was like
[01:20:00] she's still pissed with me about that he's like no best thing ever how much longer how
[01:20:03] much longer do you think he ended up in like in another year damn because he had to go
[01:20:07] through a med board oh for sure yeah but I mean there was nothing in there he's nothing
[01:20:12] in there it was literally just like signed off like good good good good like I said medical
[01:20:17] record like I said what I was what's your answer to the question it's like find you up how
[01:20:20] your shoulder's fine knee fine neck fine yep got surgery yep it's fine now yeah everything
[01:20:24] is just fine fine fine can I get out of here now yeah I want to leave yeah like like you're
[01:20:28] saying at the beginning no nobody wants to see the doctor but more to the point nobody
[01:20:33] trusts the doctor right because that's the guy who can put you on the bench what's the
[01:20:37] worst thing you do to a team guy pulling out of his balloon I give you something that's
[01:20:41] disqualifying I say oh you have a problem you need meds you're disqualified you can't
[01:20:46] take any real medification in the teams and you know that that I mean interestingly because
[01:20:54] of that nuance that's that's why I ended up learning everything that I learned as a SEAL
[01:20:59] teams and doing what I do now I mean less than 1% of what I do now has anything to do
[01:21:05] with what I learned in medical school or residency or anything like it's all outside
[01:21:10] I was talking to a guy that was oh it was Jason I think it was Jason but you know he
[01:21:17] had come from where the baseball or football where did he come from?
[01:21:21] Oh yeah yeah yeah Jethro was baseball yeah and maybe it wasn't him I was talking to somebody
[01:21:27] that was football and he said something like he worked at Bud's Medical and at Bud's Medical
[01:21:36] he said he would see like whatever the number was 40 cases of patella femoral syndrome a
[01:21:44] week yeah and he said when he was with the NFL he saw like two cases right and it was
[01:21:50] like that for every injury like shin splints if you're at Bud's Medical you see 50 cases
[01:21:55] a week of shin splints and you just go down the list of shoulder injury and so the teams
[01:22:00] the same way like oh shoulder injury knee injury like you're just gonna see so many of it you
[01:22:05] get so good at it right that it's like an environment where you're just gonna learn
[01:22:11] so much so so you were in this critical role as this thing kind of stood up where the the
[01:22:18] teams started taking the health of the seal more like as serious as we could possibly
[01:22:25] take yeah and do proactive stuff too right so what did you what does being in the teams
[01:22:32] do to a dude well so this is how it all got started right we built that facility we hired
[01:22:41] all these great people like you said pull people from pro teams from Olympic training
[01:22:46] center really top notch top tiers colleges and so we have all these brilliant people
[01:22:52] who are great at their job now I'm the dumbest guy there right because like I'm just a guy
[01:22:57] who looked worked in the sports medicine center in college and like I don't really know any
[01:23:03] of this stuff so what does the Navy do when you're the dumbest guy put you in charge right
[01:23:07] so like well now you're gonna supervise all these people and so like I now have the supervisory
[01:23:11] position and in the rehab facility and so as you know like my office was in between those
[01:23:17] two sides of it and so guys be over there doing rehab and you know I had been a seal
[01:23:23] recently enough to where there's still a ton of guys in there that I went through training
[01:23:26] with and that I deployed with and so I had a good enough reputation the guys trusted
[01:23:32] me and they come and shut the door like hey I'm tell you what's really going on with me
[01:23:36] right because like you said fine fine fine like fine fine fine everything should it's
[01:23:41] like you know the put rigorous tape over a bullet hole that they had to just really I
[01:23:45] don't want to get put on the bench trust this dude and so they came in I can't remember
[01:23:50] who the first guy was at this point but comes in it's like you know what's really going
[01:23:54] on with me and he's talking about we you know I can't remember anything right he comes in
[01:24:01] a room gets twice air leaves remember come back forget up it leaves his house five six
[01:24:06] times in the morning getting the scarf back up forgot my badge and going oh forget that's
[01:24:10] for it and and then they'd be saying when you know my motivation just sucks my concentration
[01:24:17] sucks like sitting me sitting meetings I can't I can't follow anything anybody saying like
[01:24:21] my attention span is like two seconds or I mean given the brief and I'm not interested
[01:24:25] in like you know but their team guys so they're still getting after it but they just don't
[01:24:29] feel like getting after it and they're like basically I'm getting colder weaker fatter
[01:24:34] you know like they're following the nutritionist advice they're following the strength and conditioning
[01:24:38] advice they're doing everything exactly how they should do it and they just they're getting
[01:24:41] weaker they're getting fatter and slower they're getting moody sex drives down sexual performance
[01:24:46] is down right and it's really all performance issues right so I'm not as fast I'm not as
[01:24:53] strong I'm not and then they'd be like you know but maybe I'm just getting old and I'm
[01:24:57] like yeah man you're 34 like it's over for you right you're screwed you might as good
[01:25:04] sex start your cigarette now man and so I honestly didn't have the slightest idea first
[01:25:12] guy comes in my office and tells me that's something I'm bewildered I don't know so
[01:25:17] I'm like I'm gonna do a bunch of labs and I mean it's first important to preface this
[01:25:24] with when I first got there the department had was actually a PA so a physician's assistant
[01:25:31] was supervising the physician and he'd been in Navy line where he's a former team guy
[01:25:37] and one of the first things he tells me in his office he's like hey these guys are gonna
[01:25:41] come to you and expect some special treatment I'm like yeah like we can't give it to him
[01:25:47] like why wouldn't I give it to him he's like you have to treat everybody the same like
[01:25:54] no it's in the name special forces like they get special treatment like we're we're here
[01:25:58] because of the team guys we're not here for tech support like those guys can go to the
[01:26:01] hospital right like if we have the capacity we'll see them but like I'm here to help the
[01:26:05] team guys he's like you can't think of it that way and I'm like we're not gonna get
[01:26:09] along then because that's what I'm gonna do like I'm here to help I'm here to help the
[01:26:12] community I'm gonna give a shit my my CO was a supply officer right a group one I'm gonna
[01:26:18] show you guys I'm gonna help my boys man I'm gonna do it so so everything I did was in
[01:26:27] that vein and I and it wasn't popular it wasn't popular with the seals is popular with the
[01:26:34] seals so they came in and they tell me this story about all this stuff and nothing they're
[01:26:40] saying and this is just like repeal go one guy a day one guy a week you know how it goes
[01:26:45] like word of mouth so like one and then one and one and then two and then four and and
[01:26:49] you know I'd say three months after the first guy came in and I'd probably seen a hundred
[01:26:56] guys right and they'll I mean I could have told them their story but I'd listen I take
[01:27:01] notes and listen let them tell it and they all told me the same thing they've since they
[01:27:06] done some research and they're now calling this operator syndrome I was calling it the
[01:27:11] seal syndrome and the syndrome basically means here's all the symptoms we don't know why and
[01:27:17] so it's a syndrome right and so I didn't I'm just like well I'll just test a bunch of labs
[01:27:24] and see like I don't know I was doing 98 blood markers so they're going to the hospital
[01:27:30] again like 17 vials of blood and then again everything that should be high was low everything
[01:27:37] should be low was high like their anabolic behavior super low catablog stuff really high
[01:27:43] their inflammation really high oxidation really high insulin sensitivity even nowhere
[01:27:50] near what you would expect it to be when I got this fit and this and shape and this eating
[01:27:54] this way and I have this last idea honestly I don't know I don't know and then I don't
[01:28:03] know maybe 50 or 60 guys into it somebody said to me he takes Ambien every night and
[01:28:12] I thought like I seem to say that yeah so I put a put a miss it I remember like one
[01:28:18] of the few days I was in khakis like somebody just remember she's super clear like way I
[01:28:23] sit in my desk and like remember putting this note the margin and then after he left I kept
[01:28:28] shadow files because none of the team guys wanted stuff in the record so I'm like I'm
[01:28:33] just keep a shadow file I give it to you when you leave you know or when I leave mean you
[01:28:38] do what you want to with it so I checked in my shadow files every single guy who'd been
[01:28:43] my office was an ambient 100% of them and I was like huh I wonder if that could be it
[01:28:49] now I took pharmacology in medical school so I knew how Ambien worked but I didn't know
[01:28:56] enough of like I knew it acts like GABA right GABA is a neuropeptide and like you heard
[01:29:03] GABA pentane you give it for nerve pain because it slows down their function essentially right
[01:29:07] okay and I'm like but I don't know enough about sleep to know why that's significant
[01:29:12] what GABA does in sleep I don't know I didn't have a single class on sleep in medical school
[01:29:18] and you know the way the pharmaceutical industry works you know when they apply for FDA approval
[01:29:28] they own the research and they give the FDA what they want to give them they don't give
[01:29:31] them what they don't want to give them but then if they ever get sued in court they have
[01:29:35] to pull up the skirt and show everything so that had happened with Ambien like right before
[01:29:40] this happened and so they were getting sued and so now we knew the real side effect profile
[01:29:47] and so I just had to learn a ton about non-traditional medicine had to learn a ton about sleep I thought
[01:29:54] maybe it was adrenal fatigue like I was trying which isn't even like a real thing but yeah
[01:30:00] that was kind of like the alternative medicine thing with all the adrenal fatigue it's like
[01:30:04] an HPA mismatch that there's some validity to it but it's really not like the way it's
[01:30:10] proposed but I was having some success doing that like but it wasn't huge and then but
[01:30:17] I'd noticed like everybody's testosterone was low everybody's growth hormone was low
[01:30:21] like low low right but in medicine like I'm a western trained medical physician right
[01:30:29] so I know how to recognize and treat disease what do I do if it's not disease right it's
[01:30:34] within the bell curve but it probably should be higher but there's no right so the chair
[01:30:42] at UCLA the chair of endocrinology at UCLA had done this research where he stratified
[01:30:47] the bell curve for testosterone and broke it into quintiles so 80% to 160 to 80 right
[01:30:55] and the top quintile you had the lowest risk of death for many cause lowest risk of any
[01:31:02] disease every quintile you go down it doubles so about time you're in the fifth quintile
[01:31:06] that's 16 times you're 16 times more likely to die of any cause you're 16 times more
[01:31:12] likely to have any disease every guy who came in to see me was in that quintile now if that
[01:31:17] were magnesium it would be medical malpractice to not give everybody magnesium and keep them
[01:31:22] in the upper quintile but because athletes use tear testosterone cheat and sports it's
[01:31:27] political so you don't give that right that's a no no so I wasn't about they weren't about
[01:31:32] to let me give guys testosterone but then I learned hey when you're sleeping that's when
[01:31:36] your testosterone is made that's when everything's rebalanced all your hormones the most anabolic
[01:31:40] time in your life is the first sleep cycle right you go through your first sleep cycle
[01:31:45] and most the most of that is deep sleep deep sleep has the lowest stress hormones the catabolic
[01:31:51] hormones that you'll ever have in 24 hours and and has the highest anabolic so most of
[01:31:58] your repair right obviously when you work out you don't get stronger you weaker you
[01:32:02] damage yourself when it repairs it comes back stronger well that's happening while you're
[01:32:08] sleeping so I thought so once I learned like what goes on when you go to sleep and what
[01:32:14] I had going for me was you know the teams had already done some great work and I had
[01:32:18] a great reputation because this is like 2009 right 2010 and so I could call up anybody
[01:32:24] be like hey I read your book or saw your Ted talk or heard your lecture and I'm the doctor
[01:32:31] for the West Coast sealed team so it's wonderful if I could train with you or consult with
[01:32:34] you own clients whatever everybody was like here to help right so I got to learn a lot
[01:32:39] really quickly and I start and I started trying to tell the leadership that I thought that
[01:32:46] a lot of our performance issues are chronic injuries and are you know just guys not feeling
[01:32:53] good not performing well not feeling motivated not being resilient I said I think a lot of
[01:33:00] this is from their hormones I have the proof that their hormones are they have the hormones
[01:33:05] of an 80 year old man and an 80 year old fat man actually and and I said I think it's
[01:33:13] sleep was that everybody was like that I remember you I remember you talking to me you're like
[01:33:18] I mean I was good and you know like you're like dude you're free you told me I had the
[01:33:22] test officer 17 year old football player I was like yes yes there there are some people
[01:33:28] who who just get through like for whatever reason they stay resilient you know but but
[01:33:34] but I obviously have a biased sample because people are coming to me because they have
[01:33:38] problems like everybody I see you were just getting me because I was retiring and like
[01:33:42] here I am right I got it so most of the guys were coming to you they feel like shit yeah
[01:33:46] and they're just coming to you like broke and you please help me right so then once I figured
[01:33:51] out the ambient thing I started digging into that which by the way I've never taken ambient
[01:33:56] yeah you're super unique yeah I had had the Corman pulled pull medical records and look
[01:34:04] and 85% of our command of the West 85% of the West Coast seal teams had a prescription
[01:34:10] for ambient yeah whether or not they were taking it I don't know but like my doc we're
[01:34:14] on deployment my doc's like hey hey we need to get my he was like see I even need to tell
[01:34:20] me but he was just telling me like hey we're out of ambient yeah like we're almost out
[01:34:23] of ambient I got to get more I'm going to whatever and I was kind of like didn't really
[01:34:27] think much of it because like I said I'd never I've never even tried it I don't even know
[01:34:30] what it feels like but guys were freaking on ambient like it was like it was yeah eat
[01:34:35] an M&M's man right and so what is it does it jack up your yes so they thought so the
[01:34:42] way they used to get people to sleep was with Benzo's like volume right and turns out if
[01:34:47] you overdose on those you quit breathing and you die and they're super hard to get off
[01:34:52] of right that's what happened to Jordan Peterson like super hard to get off of so they found
[01:34:58] these Z-drugs so GABA is this neuropeptide that basically slows neurons down right so
[01:35:05] when you're when you go to sleep one of the primary things that's happening asleep is
[01:35:10] your neocortex so the part of the brain that you think of as the human brain the wrinkly
[01:35:14] bit that's where like all your motor function is all your sensory and all your processing
[01:35:18] of that like your interpretation of the world that's how you interact with the world was
[01:35:23] that part right so that that slows down and you quit interacting with the world quit paying
[01:35:29] attention your senses still work obviously right because I can turn on the light and
[01:35:33] your eyes still sense the light you'll wake up right I can make a loud noise so you're
[01:35:37] all your senses are still working you're just not paying attention to them so GABA is the
[01:35:41] primary neuropeptide that's making that happen so pharmaceutical industry the way they work
[01:35:47] is like well if we figure out this one step of this process then we can supercharge that
[01:35:53] step right so now this is going to bind a GABA receptor but it's going to do a hundred
[01:35:58] times more than GABA does and that was benzos and then the Z-jugs like a thousand times
[01:36:06] what GABA does what's a Z I don't know I can't like another brand name or another form that's
[01:36:12] a category so that's like Ambien and Lunesta and there used to be a third one I can't remember
[01:36:16] and these are like a thousand times that's a thousand times the effect of GABA so what
[01:36:20] was happening is just dissociating people so so they would take this and basically
[01:36:28] they quit interpreting their senses but they could still be awake and so the reason they
[01:36:33] were getting sued is people were like driving down and doing a lizard brain stuff they're
[01:36:37] driving down picking up prostitutes they're driving down and eating you know oh god fifty
[01:36:43] hundred dollars worth of fast food they're going to Vegas and gambling their life savings
[01:36:48] away and mortgaging their house and and wake up the next day down here remember it you
[01:36:53] have no recollection of it whatsoever and so that's what they start that's what they're
[01:36:57] getting sued for is it somewhat addictive to Ambien it is for this reason so so yeah
[01:37:04] the first thing that happens obviously the blue light goes out of our eyes that chain
[01:37:08] that makes some changes in our brain and act and melatonin gets created everybody's heard
[01:37:14] of that this and it's a hormone in your brain and that's like the initiation of everything
[01:37:20] right that's the as Matt Walker calls it the starter pistol which I think is a great metaphor
[01:37:24] so that initiates everything and then one of the primary things that happen is GABA
[01:37:29] comes in and slows down the brain you quit paying attention to your environment your
[01:37:32] body temperature goes down and like that's what makes you feel sleepy so if your your
[01:37:39] body is a really smart machine right it's efficient it's not going to do anything it
[01:37:43] doesn't need to do that's why if I give you testosterone you quit making testosterone
[01:37:47] why the hell are you going to spend energy making it you're getting it for free so if
[01:37:52] I give you GABA and it's having a thousand times the effect of GABA or I'm sorry if
[01:37:59] I give you a Z-Drag it's having a thousand times the effect of GABA all the receptors
[01:38:04] for GABA we only need one one thousandth of them because you have all you have all of
[01:38:09] this freaking GABA everywhere it's like you don't need all these receptors you know so
[01:38:16] what happens is you down regulate receptors and now you quit taking that your GABA deficient
[01:38:22] no matter how much GABA you have in your brain because you need a thousand times what you
[01:38:25] would ordinarily have just to be normal now because you have so few receptors and then
[01:38:29] the receptors take six to eight weeks to come back nobody can wait six to eight weeks to
[01:38:33] start sleeping again right so they get they're really hard to get off of too sure that's
[01:38:38] why the ambient becomes addictive yeah so people can't quit it because it's just making
[01:38:43] them normal it's the same thing when people take you know 50 milligrams or even 10 milligrams
[01:38:47] of melatonin it's like your brain only makes about six micrograms from the time the sun
[01:38:52] goes down until you wake up you're taking 10 milligrams all at once way more than you're
[01:38:58] and you're going to down regulate receptors and now when you quit taking melatonin your
[01:39:02] melatonin deficient because you don't have enough receptors how long does it take to
[01:39:05] get back to where you're producing melatonin again well you're still producing it it's
[01:39:09] just like you're producing a normal amount with maybe a tenth or one hundredth of the
[01:39:13] receptors so you're deficient because you need both it doesn't matter how much do you
[01:39:18] get them back eventually receptors yeah it takes like six to eight weeks that is you
[01:39:22] know SSRIs are very similar like they're working on serotonin reuptake and they're working
[01:39:27] on receptors and takes like six to eight weeks to really start working and takes six to eight
[01:39:31] weeks to recover from and guys that do testosterone you do you ever start making that again if
[01:39:39] you go on if you're on testosterone it depends on how long you're on and what you do while
[01:39:43] you're on it right so there are things that you can do to maintain testicular volume and
[01:39:48] function most doc in the box guys don't do this you know they're just like here's what
[01:39:56] does testosterone and then and most of the most of the guys that I end up seeing yeah
[01:40:02] they're they're being seen by some guy who's given them like two or three hundred milligrams
[01:40:06] once a week or once every two weeks so it's getting like this huge surge they're going
[01:40:10] super physiologic for a few days turn into a caveman for like two days and then they
[01:40:16] down regulate their receptors and that testosterone gets converted into estrogen and estrogen
[01:40:20] is the signal in your brain to tell your brain how much testosterone you have so if your
[01:40:24] estrogen is high your brain assumes that from testosterone so now you quit producing as
[01:40:30] much testosterone and so they get this peak now they down regulate their receptors right
[01:40:36] and they down regulate their own production and so after a few months of that once all
[01:40:40] the receptors have changed and all the physiologies change now they're super physiologic for
[01:40:45] maybe a day or two and they're normal for a day or two and now they're low the whole
[01:40:50] rest of the time some guys that's two weeks and so they'll always come in and be like
[01:40:54] hey I started this and I felt great and now I feel just like I did before I started and
[01:40:59] I'll say how much are you taking how often are they are they looking at your DHT are
[01:41:06] they looking at your estrogen are they looking at your sex hormone binding globulin are they
[01:41:09] looking like are they looking at anything other than your testosterone are they even
[01:41:11] looking at your free testosterone because total testosterone really doesn't matter how much
[01:41:15] of it is available and so like this is true with every hormone anything anything any hormone
[01:41:24] I give you you're going to quit making it now there are things that I can there's things
[01:41:30] I can give you that will cause you to keep making testosterone while you're taking testosterone
[01:41:34] it's not perfect but those guys that can come off of testosterone probably be okay there's
[01:41:40] they're still going to be bad off right because they they weren't able to make enough when
[01:41:46] I met them so now they're going to be a little worse than that when they got off and so like
[01:41:50] what I was doing with the team guys is I was first doing it with like all supplements first
[01:41:55] I was getting guys to sleep and getting them off of the ambient right and that's that just
[01:41:59] came from me and I couldn't just say quit taking your ambient because our you know our
[01:42:03] community one is good two is better and three is probably great so they're taking like three
[01:42:07] ambient with we're taking seven they're taking three ambient with like a couple of cocktails
[01:42:13] and then they're waking up at 430 not intentionally you know they're waking up at 430 and they're
[01:42:19] like can't go back to sleep so I'm going to go in the gym I'm going to work out really
[01:42:22] hard today I'm not going to take any breaks from work all day when I come home tonight
[01:42:25] I'm going to be tired and I'll go to sleep like all right how long have you been doing
[01:42:27] that like three years keep going tonight tonight I think right like obviously not that's not
[01:42:33] that obviously is not working right and so like once I learned how ambient destroys REM
[01:42:41] sleep like 80% of REM sleep goes away and it knocks out about 20% of deep sleep alcohol
[01:42:48] to exactly the opposite so destroys deep sleep gets rid of about 20 so when I sent these guys
[01:42:55] in for sleep studies 99.9% stage two sleep so they weren't getting any deep sleep any
[01:43:01] REM sleep do they wake up in the morning feel like shit yeah how do they even I don't even
[01:43:05] know how they survived it honestly like and that's one of the things about medicine proves
[01:43:10] to you how little we know because that should kill them should kill them in a couple of
[01:43:14] weeks because that's the same as getting no sleep you would think but this is what you
[01:43:19] know the ambient lawsuits kind of were fortunately out to where I could learn all that and so
[01:43:24] I couldn't just take away their ambient and alcohol and say suck it up buttercup right
[01:43:28] like I had to give them something so I did some research and came up with a bunch of
[01:43:31] things and they were having to go to all those pre-amazons they're having to drive around
[01:43:36] to three different stores and get all the ingredients and try to travel with it and it was a pain
[01:43:40] and so now they really have rang me into making a product out of it to make it easier for
[01:43:46] them so I you know I figured out the sleep was a huge component and that that was causing
[01:43:56] me to get a lot of their low testosterone and then there's things I can give you like
[01:44:00] the precursors to testosterone like DHEA and you can do a form of DHEA 7 keto DHEA that
[01:44:05] can't be converted into estrogen so that's good right I can give you zinc citrate which
[01:44:11] will decrease the amount of estrogen you make from a testosterone and then like some guys
[01:44:19] I was giving a pharmaceutical called a remodax and that blocks estrogen conversion to it's
[01:44:24] called a roma tase inhibitor and so just with like DHEA pregnant alone which is another
[01:44:34] precursor to the testosterone pathway and some zinc or a remodax and getting guys to
[01:44:40] sleep guys are tripling quadrupling their testosterone levels over six months 46 months
[01:44:48] right yeah I one of the CEOs out there he got like in the couple of years I was treating
[01:44:57] him you know like three PRs like like weight lifting and running and like say something
[01:45:02] else and like in his 40s like this is the best he's ever been in his life because he's you
[01:45:08] know he's been broken down we and like our community has some of that just because of
[01:45:14] the chaotic sleep anyway right just because well tonight you're working and then tomorrow
[01:45:19] you're working too and then you know and now we're going to travel and we're going to
[01:45:22] go over here we're going to do this and like and so every like you sleep when you can obviously
[01:45:26] right and so it's chaotic and if you aren't aligned with your circadian rhythm sleep is
[01:45:30] nowhere near as valuable and so I got I got guys sleeping they had huge performance gains
[01:45:38] there are a few older guys that I couldn't get them to make enough testosterone to be
[01:45:44] in the number one so I think when they they they like shut me down and have me under investigation
[01:45:52] for a while and like I mean I essentially sacrificed my career for like there was no
[01:45:59] way I was getting any kind of Navy residency or anything because I was just in trouble
[01:46:03] all the time with Bumad or the hospital or Warcom whatever like everybody's then even
[01:46:09] like my name out about that I was practicing outside of my scope that I was like I was
[01:46:18] giving people was called Myers cocktails when I thought that it was adrenal fatigue IV vitamins
[01:46:25] apparently I'm not allowed to do that as a doctor and I got in a lot of trouble for
[01:46:29] that the aromatics ignorant doctors will say to cancer drug why you in somebody cancer
[01:46:37] drug it's not a cancer drug you moron I mean you give it to women with breast cancer because
[01:46:42] their breast cancer is estrogen sensitive and you want them to make less estrogen that's
[01:46:46] nothing you do with cancer like you just don't want them to have estrogen it's an estrogen
[01:46:51] blocker that's all it is so yeah I just like everything I did you know and all it takes
[01:46:59] because I was a junior doctor right like all it takes is for somebody senior to me anywhere
[01:47:03] in the medical chain be like he's doing what why is he doing that like no we can't allow
[01:47:07] that and so then they call Warcom and complain that this rogue doctor is doing all this crazy
[01:47:14] voodoo stuff that's what it's called like voodoo and when even when I when I told the leadership
[01:47:20] Andrew or was crown guard with Alex Alex Cron guard he was the Commodore at the time
[01:47:31] and he was super receptive leave he's smart educated on all the stuff but everybody else
[01:47:37] like literally laughs me out of their office going you gotta be kidding me their testosterone
[01:47:44] low because they aren't sleeping right doc like you got some problems and but then started
[01:47:50] getting results and people started performing better and word of mouth spread and then they
[01:47:55] started having me lecture at the pre and post retreats and then I you know that's when I
[01:48:00] like was sharing the stage with like Rob Wolfe and well-born and Cressor and like all those
[01:48:07] guys and then they started inviting me on podcast and invited me to other symposiums
[01:48:11] and stuff and like that's kind of where my career went because of what I was doing with
[01:48:16] our with our guys so what what year did you end up getting out of the Navy January 13
[01:48:21] so you retired from the Navy of January 13 I didn't retire but I got 19 years you see
[01:48:27] this yeah yeah well well so but medical school is like the Academy so it only counts retro
[01:48:37] so you have to do 24 years to retire so I would have to stand five more years okay and
[01:48:42] there was there was nowhere for me to go I mean let's get it up in Antarctica or something
[01:48:47] yeah yeah I'd burn I'd burned a lot of bridges to do what I did yeah so then what'd you do
[01:48:52] when you punched out so you kind of had a win worked at the concierge practice and in
[01:48:57] point Loma with the doctor who talked me into becoming a doctor and then he wanted me to
[01:49:02] see him in that practice and take it over and it was exactly what I thought I wanted
[01:49:08] you know and I was already doing some private consulting people heard me on podcast and
[01:49:12] be like hey I want to work with you so it's sort of telemedicine like zoom stuff Skype
[01:49:17] in those days I guess and so I was doing some of that and then but of course when I left
[01:49:24] I created like this vacuum because the next guy who came to the teams was just like a doctor
[01:49:29] like regular doctor is just waiting biting his time you try and do like a turnover of
[01:49:33] what you had learned with him yeah but but he was like I want to I want to stay in the
[01:49:39] Navy yeah after seeing what happened to me there wasn't anybody who's going to be interested
[01:49:42] in doing what I done has the world caught up with these protocols yeah yeah like I'd
[01:49:47] say maybe four or five years after I got out like so come hired me to come and lecture
[01:49:53] there and like lecture all their medical staff and like damn neck hired me to come in do lecture
[01:49:57] and teach all their medical staff and I consult on all those guys on a fairly regular basis
[01:50:04] is the H. Liddell Hart who wrote the book called he wrote a bunch of countless books
[01:50:09] but you know he's a he's a world war one guy fought at the song he wrote the book that
[01:50:16] I love called the indirect approach but one of the things he says in that book is the
[01:50:20] first person with an idea if they stick with that idea and they hold on to it guess what
[01:50:26] they become a martyr so you look out through throughout history like you have an idea and
[01:50:32] you you're like hey this is the way it should be you end up a martyr and that's kind of
[01:50:36] like what happened to you because it takes a while for ideas to get accepted he he rolls
[01:50:40] out this one example of with the major changes that have been made to warships over the past
[01:50:46] whatever it is 200 years every major change that came like no one accepted it until like
[01:50:53] somebody got martyred and then you know like going from whatever from sale to like steam
[01:51:01] right this first guy's like are you an idiot what are you gonna do when you're out at sea
[01:51:04] and there's no coal you're an idiot like we can sail forever and sure enough these guys
[01:51:09] get fired and then the next guy says you know we should make the holes out of out of metal
[01:51:13] and set a wood were you an idiot how are you gonna repair those they're heavier than
[01:51:17] more all those things and that's what happens so if you're the if you're the first person
[01:51:22] to roll out if you're not careful now you can be careful you can get it done in a more this
[01:51:27] is what he talks about yeah a more indirect manner so if you had said all right I'm gonna
[01:51:31] be like super strategic and I'm gonna run this up the chain it would have taken longer
[01:51:34] you had to you had to tell a bunch of guys I can't do anything for you now you know it
[01:51:38] would have taken you seven years or whatever right so I'm not saying it would have been
[01:51:41] it just a that indirect approach is how is the only way to well not the only way but
[01:51:46] it's probably the only way to avoid becoming a martyr but for you you're sitting there
[01:51:50] looking at people that are hurting and you're like all right I'm gonna help you guys need
[01:51:53] help right now like it's totally totally worth it like I was fully aware of what I was doing
[01:51:58] I'm not I'm not whining about it like I knew what I was doing at the time I had a quote
[01:52:03] taped in my monitor from Buckminster Fuller said it said never fight the system create
[01:52:12] a superior system to make the old one obsolete so it's like I'm just gonna do the right thing
[01:52:18] because like I learned all this stuff from other people right it's not like I invented
[01:52:23] right what I was doing I mean I had a few novel ideas but for the most part like I learned
[01:52:28] all this from other people so this was going on in the world it wasn't going on in our
[01:52:32] world and now it's in our world like you know but I left this back and when I left and so
[01:52:38] all these guys kept coming to me like when they got when they got out especially and
[01:52:43] I don't know if you do you know anything about the honor the honor foundation yeah yeah
[01:52:49] I mean I definitely know about it yeah for sure so Joe Musselman was spoken there a couple
[01:52:54] times yeah so Joe Musselman was the guy who found out he's a guy didn't make three buds
[01:53:00] and he wanted to do this educational component of it and I'd seen enough team guys like these
[01:53:06] guys need a medical rehab that year too right so like educate them for a year but like let's
[01:53:10] get them in medical shape first so that they can actually learn so they can remember they
[01:53:14] can sleep they can right and so they're not emotional wrecks and you know racked with
[01:53:18] anxiety and all those and all this other stuff and so we pitched that's how I got back and
[01:53:25] involved with Dr. Rice a guy who talked to me in medical school is he had this great
[01:53:31] clinic and Point Loma is huge and he had very few patients and so he had the clinical space
[01:53:37] and we're like so we pitched him like hey man could we run like this pilot program through
[01:53:42] here and we were trying to raise money for that and the money just wasn't there for the
[01:53:46] medical because it's too expensive but we did like I think we did like 10 families like
[01:53:52] team team guys family or something proof of concept and so and then I would and then I
[01:53:59] ended up working at the clinic instead of just doing my plan was to do that like to build
[01:54:03] that because all that everybody was calling me anyways all the team guys are calling me
[01:54:07] anyway and they're still to this day like I'm always managing 50 guys and you're one they
[01:54:16] trust me to I know our community better than anybody and I know what they need I know what
[01:54:21] their problems are before they even know their problems are and so I was like that's kind
[01:54:29] of been my philanthropic work it's just like I just kept you do that for civilians.
[01:54:33] As well I do it for civilians and they pay me they pay me a lot so that I don't have
[01:54:39] to charge the team guys and up until just recently like I'm on a bunch of different advisory
[01:54:44] boards for the nonprofits who are trying to help our guys out and so I've never charged
[01:54:51] any of the team guys for my time but they have to pay for their meds because they're
[01:54:57] not you know it's not coming through trichar and so now a lot of these foundations are
[01:55:02] paying for their meds and so in the last couple of years like it's it's gotten a lot better
[01:55:07] you know and there there's even I haven't seen any but I there's other doctors that
[01:55:12] are doing this work with these foundations and they're they're treating some active duty
[01:55:16] guys too so and then you ended up making your your sleep supplement too yeah so actually
[01:55:22] when I was when I was at the I was at the clinic I was at the concierge clinic is life
[01:55:31] wellness by the way give him a shout out maybe like wellness in point loma still still active
[01:55:36] still there yeah life wellness institute of things called and you know so I worked there
[01:55:42] for a year and I mean I just I just had so much there's so much demand for my time and
[01:55:49] like there's no way I could do what I needed to do the team still hadn't caught up they
[01:55:55] still aren't doing anything about sleep and so the guys were just kind of haranguing me
[01:56:01] into like to just make a product like how hard is this to do I'm like all right like
[01:56:05] I'll so I'm like I'm gonna step away from the clinic for a year I'm gonna start the sleep
[01:56:09] supplement I'll just live off of my consulting and I think I was doing an hourly rate back
[01:56:14] then I do like annual programs now but I said I'll just live off of my consulting I'll
[01:56:20] start this thing up and I'm good go back and so your consulting is this medical consulting
[01:56:25] for individual humans is that what yeah okay so I mean I do like I do some organizational
[01:56:30] stuff like they'll like whatever law enforcement or professional sports team wherever they'll
[01:56:35] hire me to lecture and kind of help them design a program you're talking about like hey I
[01:56:41] want you to help me feel better yeah and so here's my money yeah so now I have now I now
[01:56:46] I do annual programs people can only do a year like I won't I don't do multiple years
[01:56:51] like I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know in a year you have to have another
[01:56:54] doctor because I'm not I'm not your primary care or whatever yeah you gotta you gotta cold
[01:57:00] you ever broken leg like that's not me so I and what I do is performance like I didn't
[01:57:04] break I didn't call it that at the teams but if you think about that's exactly what it's
[01:57:07] doing is performance right none these guys had a disease they just weren't performing
[01:57:12] like they felt like they should perform and so so that that's what I do now and so it's
[01:57:18] mainly like you know big executives or entrepreneurs traded their health for wealth for 20 or 30
[01:57:25] years and now they had like a big exit whatever like you know they sold their company they
[01:57:30] have a hundred million dollars don't care about money they want to buy that health they want
[01:57:33] to be division one athletes again I'm like pump the brakes Sparky like maybe we can get
[01:57:40] you we can drop 40 pounds of fat off you in the year and get you back into being able
[01:57:45] to be physical and you know yeah so so yeah I I I charge those guys a lot of money one
[01:57:52] to make sure that they're motivated and to just a pace for me to treat him guys and then
[01:57:58] like right before I'd say like a year before I got out I was at a conference where a guy
[01:58:05] was lecturing on TBI and I had at least one guy I knew that had TBI because that's this
[01:58:11] is what we thought about TBI's in this time so you know if somebody hadn't been knocked
[01:58:16] unconscious then you didn't think they had a TBI so then I went to this guy's lecture
[01:58:21] and he was working with Pugelist and and some NFL guys he starts throwing up his case
[01:58:28] reports and like looking at their blood markers like exactly like my guys you're kidding me
[01:58:37] so then I start doing my own research and in 2009 there was a JAMA article written and
[01:58:42] it was done between Cambridge and Harvard thousands of people and they they have this
[01:58:50] imaging called DTI's and it's like it's so it's so the resolution so clear they can see
[01:58:58] a single neuronal track breaking pain and they call that a minor TBI so they're like
[01:59:04] what's the threshold it turns out is a 1.09 G's they got that from the 1.09 G's can cause
[01:59:13] a minor TBI minor TBI they were getting that from the acceleration changes on a roller
[01:59:16] coaster and I'm like I wonder how much our stuff is so I started investigating like you
[01:59:22] know and this stuff we've tested like we haven't tested everything obviously but you know that
[01:59:28] they're like the fat like damn next fast but they average 60 G's for hours they peak
[01:59:35] over 100 G's so they're just like head injury head injury head injury like every freaking
[01:59:41] wave right and then I started learning about over pressurization TBI right it's going to
[01:59:49] be great and so I don't know what the threshold is for that but it's something close to that
[01:59:55] one point around G's right well if you're if you're in a concrete room with three and
[02:00:03] four is like every round that comes out as 30 G's if you're shooting a called Gustav
[02:00:10] the shooter gets 200 G's the spotter gets like 300 G's you know the you know hard
[02:00:20] parachute openings or two to three G's being in the back of a Humby with a 50 cal going
[02:00:27] to like 60 G's every every round you know so I'm like well I don't have a guy who doesn't
[02:00:32] have thousands of TBI's and this has now been proven and if you know Larkin Frank Larkin
[02:00:39] and his son yeah suicide it and he had his brain analyzed and so when you look at if
[02:00:46] you look at fighters and look at NFL's NFL guys they have the CT right you heard that
[02:00:53] and it's like specific regions of the brain that's shows some specific abnormalities what
[02:00:58] happens in the and the over pressurization is like that pressure wave goes through your
[02:01:03] skull right it goes right through your skull and then they have it on photography now like
[02:01:09] I guess it's what a lot of frames per second or so 60 frames per second or something I
[02:01:16] can slow that down and get really resolute with it so as the as the wave comes by it's
[02:01:23] just like any other way if it's moving it's having impact on the material that's going
[02:01:27] through well the different densities move at different rates so the lining of your brain
[02:01:33] the dura that moves at a different rate than the vasculature and that means that a different
[02:01:37] rate than the white matter and that moves at a different rate than the gray matter and
[02:01:41] that moves at a different rate than the little vesicles that hold the cerebral spinal fluid
[02:01:46] so let's put it in a blender you just hear everything and we have and when you do autopsy
[02:01:52] is on our guys he's so excited their entire brain is covered with these talphur genes like
[02:01:57] these markers for damage at every interface so where where the vasculature meets the brain
[02:02:03] where the dura meets the brain where the white matter meets the gray matter with gray matter
[02:02:06] reach meets the cerebral spinal fluid the entire brain and we don't know what to do
[02:02:12] about that now there's peptides out that we know help that's going to be the next that's
[02:02:18] the next frontier of medicine I believe that's where I'm spending a lot of my time with our
[02:02:23] guys now hyperbaric helps for sure hormones obviously help so you know that that's you
[02:02:33] know that that's what that's what our guys need but this needs to be done proactively
[02:02:37] because you think about it like over time the equipment just keeps getting more and more
[02:02:42] dynamic the people inside the equipment are the same right we're the fragile bit now and
[02:02:50] there's got to be like it's different for different people you always bring up George
[02:02:53] Forman and Muhammad Ali like George Forman right now he's up there you know totally good
[02:02:57] to go right and I've known a lot of fighters and some fighters are just like they're fine
[02:03:03] right and some guys are not clearly and it's the same thing with football like you meet
[02:03:07] guys that played football their whole life and then they went out and they're doing totally
[02:03:10] normal things and other guys get totally messed up from football so there's got to be some
[02:03:14] genetic component to it as well right yeah there's there's genetic variation to everything
[02:03:18] right so and I don't know why anybody surprised by this right it's like you know we'd like
[02:03:26] to say that all men are created equal it's not true this is like every people aren't
[02:03:31] equal and some people have aptitudes that other people don't have you know it's like
[02:03:35] this this this misnomer of the super sleeper right if you have this gene combination then
[02:03:41] you don't need as much sleep it's not true you know what's true is that you don't suffer
[02:03:46] as much as most people when you don't sleep right when you short when you short sleep
[02:03:51] you don't have the same problems as the average Joe now there's somebody on the other side
[02:03:55] of the spectrum too that you take a few hours of sleep away and they're completely incapacitated
[02:04:00] these are people who don't make it through hell week these are people don't make it
[02:04:03] into our community I've always well you know people always talk about my sleep and I the
[02:04:08] genetic component I talk about because like my oldest daughter I would be going to bed
[02:04:14] at 11 o'clock at night when she was in high school and she'd be up studying yeah and I'd
[02:04:17] wake up at 430 in the morning and she'd be up studying and and so she was just kind of
[02:04:22] like me right she didn't need a ton of sleep my wife like this girl's going to bed yeah
[02:04:28] I mean she's going to bed and like she'll be up later right right my my middle daughter
[02:04:36] if there's not an emergency going on she's in she's she's gonna get out of bed when
[02:04:40] she feels like it like yeah there's not major emergency going on my son's kind of like
[02:04:46] he can be he can deal without sleep pretty well and then my youngest daughter just like
[02:04:51] my wife so it seems to me like and you know we all live in the same house right there's
[02:04:56] like half of us get up early and are going to do something the other half are still in
[02:05:00] bed and that's the way it is every day and it's not because I treated them any differently
[02:05:05] yeah I wanted them all to get up early and some of them just it's not part of their gig
[02:05:08] right it's not part of my wife's gig either people people say to me like how do you get
[02:05:13] up in the morning like without waking up your wife my wife ain't waking up unless I start
[02:05:18] firing weapons in the bedroom like I'm good to go that girl is she's out and she's in
[02:05:23] her own little La La land which is awesome so it seems like there is a some level of
[02:05:28] genetic component to it where and you know this even happened in the teams like I would
[02:05:34] I definitely a hundred percent like I wouldn't need to sleep with at all and guys would be
[02:05:38] like hey I need to go down and I get cool yeah go to sleep and I could go for a really
[02:05:42] long time without you know on very little sleep and I've always been like that right
[02:05:47] and so there's there's got to be some level of like and I'm not claiming to be like oh
[02:05:51] I have some genetic gift but there's something like oh I can get by a little less you know
[02:05:55] we can test your genetics and see if you're super sleepers I wouldn't be surprised if
[02:06:00] I was and I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't you know I mean yeah it's super rare it's
[02:06:04] like the everybody wants to put themselves in that category and we're like well I'm
[02:06:08] just right and I'm not saying that I'm not I'm not saying this is you but well I just
[02:06:13] kind of did that so I guess I'm guilty but no I actually don't think I really am yeah
[02:06:16] I don't think I really am I think I I think you know I think the odds of being that is
[02:06:21] something like being struck by lightning while being attacked by a shark right okay I mean
[02:06:26] it's super super rare but I go to sleep but think about it's like anything else like how
[02:06:31] much do you suffer from a ruck like you know you're gonna go do whatever 10 20 mile ruck
[02:06:37] like how much are you gonna suffer does everybody suffer the same no right how much weight can
[02:06:42] you lift the same as everybody else like if you train the same like if you're like yeah
[02:06:46] how many how fast can you read how much do you retain like everybody's different than
[02:06:49] everything how much sleep do people need eight hours so like I if I go to sleep I can't sleep
[02:06:58] eight hours like I will not sleep eight hours and not because of how many do you sleep I
[02:07:02] could have been at 10 30 wake up before 30 like that's kind of no seven hours six hours
[02:07:08] six hours six hours six hours six hours and sometimes I go to bed at 10 you know like
[02:07:12] they're six and a half hours but you know if I'm it's hard for me to sleep like I'll
[02:07:17] be in some situation where you know whatever I go my wife and I go stay somewhere whatever
[02:07:22] and we have we there's you know no what is it there's nothing to do right we're on vacation
[02:07:29] for lack of a better word echo Charles we're cruising we're cruising and like I got a bed
[02:07:34] and it's so annoying because you know like what like then I'm awake we're in some random
[02:07:39] place and my wife's gonna sleep for more four more hours right now I'm like walking around
[02:07:43] in circles doing burpees in my room yeah so yeah it'd be interesting you know what you
[02:07:49] know what else was an interesting sleep experiment the arc did you ever do an arg platoon no
[02:07:53] so I never I nearly avoided you go out on a ship and when you're out on a ship you have
[02:07:57] no job as a seal you have no job and you're in this weird compartment where it's just
[02:08:00] dark if you you know guys and we had guys I had a guy in one of my platoons he would
[02:08:07] sleep for days I like seriously and and he was also a guy that probably had some kind
[02:08:13] of a sleep disorder because he would fall asleep on patrol like we'd we'd be patrolling
[02:08:20] and you know take a 10 minute break you know patrol for 50 minutes break for 10 patrol for
[02:08:23] 15 minutes break for 10 we'd be doing a hump across the desert we'd we'd sit down was an
[02:08:27] older guy no no no he lives in Texas I'll introduce you to him but he we'd we'd like
[02:08:34] take a break and you know you're like freaking sword you're humping through the desert thirsty
[02:08:38] and all the three minutes in the break you hear like and he'd be snoring yeah but he
[02:08:45] would go on the ship he would go on the ship sometimes he slept for like actual like like
[02:08:51] 18 hours you know and then he'd get up looking all groggy and so on the ship you could sleep
[02:08:56] as much as you possibly could want I mean there's nothing to do like subops even yeah
[02:09:01] I've something about same way even if you're the most like highly disciplined person and
[02:09:05] you're trying to complete your degree and you're learning to play guitar and you're
[02:09:09] working out you still have like an extra 17 hours to do nothing yeah so but even on the
[02:09:14] argument was like I could sleep but I and I didn't really think about sleep too much
[02:09:18] but I like I'd go to sleep and then just wake up like okay well I'm gonna do whatever
[02:09:22] yeah I mean there's several genes that I wouldn't be surprised if you have some of them I'm
[02:09:28] a guy who can get away without much sleep as well it's not as true now it's not true
[02:09:34] now like the older you get the harder it is but my freaking old neighbor Vietnam dude
[02:09:40] this this dude like I'd wake up in the morning he'd be sitting out on this porch yeah he's
[02:09:46] like yeah I don't sleep I don't need to sleep I'm watching the neighborhood he'd tell me
[02:09:49] I'd be like right oh man yeah yeah I mean it it's there's there's variation like when
[02:09:55] I was in I mean obviously the whole time I was in college and the whole time I was in
[02:10:00] medical school like I had a married and have kids you know like I'm coming over medical
[02:10:04] school like making dinner for my kids you know giving them baths reading them to sleep
[02:10:10] deprivation like it and I sleep in five hours a night on a good night for ten years now though
[02:10:19] part of its age but part of its and it wasn't until I figured this out for the team guys
[02:10:25] that I said well maybe I should apply this shit to myself right so I started sleeping
[02:10:28] more and now I now I'm really bad at functioning without sleep like I got used to it and I
[02:10:36] think you kind of the thing about sleep like one of the things it makes then obviously
[02:10:42] I don't just do sleep but sleep to big component of what I do just because it's the most important
[02:10:47] factor of your health if I do my job well first of all the sales pitch sucks because
[02:10:54] what sleep good for everything what's the worst thing you can say in marketing like
[02:10:59] it fixes anything like every you're better at everything when you sleep well you're smarter
[02:11:04] you're faster stronger smarter you're better looking like everything everything's better
[02:11:09] lower stress hormones higher anabolic hormones better appetite regulation everything's better
[02:11:13] when you sleep and so that's a terrible sales pitch now the other thing is like if I do
[02:11:19] my job really well and you sleep amazingly well you won't remember it at all and like
[02:11:25] no trust me it was great for you and like you know now at least you have wearables
[02:11:30] and you have people tracking their sleep and something like there's some you know there's
[02:11:33] something to make it a little easier for me and that and that respect but like there's
[02:11:38] I mean there's no question that's the most important aspect of your life and the big
[02:11:43] problem the other big problem of sleep is that when you so like the whole point of me
[02:11:47] going to sleep tonight is to repair everything that I did to myself today right everything
[02:11:53] that every fuel source I exhausted that needs to be replenished or any damage I've done
[02:11:58] that needs to be fixed and then I need to you store things and organize things and set
[02:12:04] hormone regulation for tomorrow so I'm repairing from today and preparing for tomorrow well
[02:12:11] it takes eight hours to recover from sixteen hours vast majority of the time let's say
[02:12:16] ninety five percent of people in the planet that way ninety eight percent of people maybe
[02:12:19] that way if I only sleep six hours instead of eight hours tomorrow still comes right
[02:12:26] if I didn't repair and prepare a hundred percent how do I do tomorrow right where am I going
[02:12:31] to get the energy from well I'm going to get that from stress hormones that's going to
[02:12:34] increase and stress hormones are catabolic if you think about it if I went to sleep and
[02:12:39] I could repair a hundred percent and prepare a hundred percent for tomorrow I would never
[02:12:43] age right I'd be exactly the same every day I'd wake up exactly the same every day there
[02:12:49] would be no aging involved the fact that I can't the reason I age if I decide to cut
[02:12:56] away twenty five percent of my sleep on purpose I'm choosing age twenty five percent faster
[02:13:01] if I'm somebody who's capable of sleeping eight hours right and like you said like not
[02:13:06] everybody is and some of that's learned some of that's yeah I'm going to be like habitually
[02:13:11] right and like I had a eighty well she's in her late seventies at the time a client like
[02:13:19] probably ten years ago and she's like I haven't slept more than four hours and twenty years
[02:13:25] and I was like that's not good for you so I get her like just sleep hygiene just my sleep
[02:13:33] supplement no drugs no hormones like just like nutritional supplements and sleep hygiene
[02:13:38] ritual around sleep start sleeping eight hours and like as far as I know she still is you
[02:13:44] know I haven't talked to in a few years but she feel better she just feel like she's wasting
[02:13:47] one quarter of her day so so so here here this is true about everything I do so everything
[02:13:54] performance based so I get people to sleep I get people to eat right get people to exercise
[02:13:58] right and get people to control their stress get their hormones in order I get their inflammation
[02:14:02] down with peptides whatever and they come to me like oh my god I didn't realize how
[02:14:09] bad I was until I felt good and that's like a month into her and then another month later
[02:14:14] oh no no now I feel like I used to feel like now and then three it takes like three or
[02:14:19] four months of like really good behavior to realize how much you've lost because our
[02:14:25] awareness like I said our awareness of sleep isn't there that's the whole idea of it right
[02:14:29] we're not paying attention to that but our self-awareness of how impaired we are just
[02:14:35] like a drunk person the research has been done over and over again I deprive you of
[02:14:40] this much sleep I give you this many alcohol drinks your blood alcohol level is this you
[02:14:45] haven't slept this much same thing like correlates exactly I just like that's so hard for me to
[02:14:51] understand because plateau I like that here's an example of this so we do an event at echelon
[02:14:57] front called the muster and it's a big event and when we first started doing it I'll talk
[02:15:03] about the second one that we did was in New York City it's you know there's 900 people
[02:15:09] coming there's all this stuff to get done there's and so long story short we we behind
[02:15:15] the scenes we weren't as squared away as we should have been so we had a bunch of stuff
[02:15:19] to do preparing these big briefs these slides get ready and we had to do all this stuff
[02:15:23] and so life who's doing it with me I think it was like 130 in the morning and we're
[02:15:30] the events the next day it's 130 in the morning we're signing 900 certificates of graduation
[02:15:38] we're gonna wake up at 330 to go do PT so we're on stage I mean I'm on stage with two
[02:15:44] hours of sleep yeah and I'm answering questions I'm giving presentations and that day is like
[02:15:48] starts it we get up at 330 we PT we go 430 the group comes in PT's we go get up on stage
[02:15:54] we do all day same thing the next day the next day we got other stuff we got to do we
[02:15:58] get no sleep and like and bro I mean we're we're on operations we used to like going
[02:16:03] on an operation especially in Ramadi you're planning you're planning planning planning
[02:16:08] right and I'm saying especially in Ramadi for me because we would plan with the army
[02:16:13] we got to go check in with Iraq he's got all the stuff going on by the time we go in the
[02:16:16] field we haven't slept right I remember being so happy to go in the field because I can
[02:16:21] finally sleep yeah like three hours yeah under under a bush on rocks and cactus yeah and
[02:16:26] so I never and look I mean I've been drunk before right and I wouldn't want to I wouldn't
[02:16:33] trust myself to get up on stage right and and you know if I had if I had I think I could
[02:16:39] probably have four drinks and still like present at the muster it'd be a little bit
[02:16:46] extra yeah but if you got me to like six drinks it'd be a different event right and it wouldn't
[02:16:51] be good a little bit so that's a kind of an exaggeration acutely you can compensate right
[02:16:58] so if you think about it so you know you have the autonomic nervous system right you have
[02:17:06] the parasympathetic and sympathetic and in the maximal sympathetic output we call fire
[02:17:10] flight right so when you get up into fight or flight what happens you become superhuman
[02:17:17] right your pupils dilate start taking a bigger field of vision right your lungs expand you
[02:17:23] start taking the more oxygen your blood pressure goes up your peripheral perfusion goes down
[02:17:28] so if you get caught you don't bleed to death you know your reflexes get faster you release
[02:17:32] a bunch of glucose you have more endurance more strength faster reflexes like you're
[02:17:35] superhuman you feel you don't feel amazing because you're scared right but you feel alive
[02:17:41] and ready right and you're like you can react to everything faster why don't you run around
[02:17:46] like that all the time because it's catabolic you're using yourself as the fuel source to
[02:17:51] get away from the danger because it doesn't matter so that's what I do in those events
[02:17:54] yeah so it doesn't matter if you can digest your food it doesn't matter if you can fight
[02:17:57] off infection doesn't matter because like you need to get away from this threat yeah before
[02:18:02] any of that matter so you're gonna marshal a hundred percent of your resources and touch
[02:18:06] that so that's what you're doing you're digging into the well or whatever yeah you're digging
[02:18:09] in now if you recover from that yeah and believe me like not a big deal like we have gone through
[02:18:14] great lengths like now at the muster it's everything is just so well oiled I mean we're
[02:18:19] going to bed at like you know nine o'clock and we joke about like all right 8 30 I'm
[02:18:24] getting ready to go to bed like we we love that you know it's this this this is to support
[02:18:30] what you're talking about I know this a hundred percent if I don't get actually when I'm going
[02:18:37] to an event like if I'm gonna speak I sleep a little bit less because it makes me more
[02:18:45] and she's engaged with what's happening even more emotional like right I will be more emotionally
[02:18:51] engaged if I'm super well rested I'm just kind of like cool like yeah everything's good
[02:18:57] and and I'll tell you another thing that well you already mentioned it like when I'm if I'm
[02:19:02] eating like crap yeah bro my sleep it's a desire I feel like crap right but the sleep is crap
[02:19:07] and that's a disaster the other thing is when you talk about stress I mean I don't stress
[02:19:15] about a lot like even like and I think it's getting you know you get used to in the teams
[02:19:20] like what what you know I wrote about in this book like what you got to know what to worry
[02:19:23] about what's important what's not important and for me the list of things that are important
[02:19:28] is this list that has like four things on it is like is your fam is my family healthy
[02:19:33] right right like okay like that's something else but hey they're healthy so I'm not stressed
[02:19:38] about that I can't like there's nothing else in the stress box that I'm really like because
[02:19:43] if you know what's going on oh I brought this product is coming out okay well what if the
[02:19:49] product fails okay then we'll do something yeah like so I think I'm pretty good with
[02:19:54] the keeping myself out of the stress zone eating good when I eat like crap I feel like
[02:20:01] crap look and pizza's a you know you gotta look at some pizza whoever invented that like
[02:20:07] what an evil bastard and chocolate chip cookies on the new york so like you get that but I'm
[02:20:12] lucky I don't like pizza I didn't like it until I was like damn but like my wife man she made
[02:20:19] this she my wife's the best prime rub prime rib in the world like it's the world-class
[02:20:24] prime rib and somehow she triple ordered or something over Thanksgiving because we eat
[02:20:31] prime rib for Thanksgiving but she we thought we're having people people didn't show up
[02:20:34] all the loss we had just massive hunks of prime rib yeah and probably I did like almost
[02:20:39] a carnivore thing yeah we're like four or five days and then and then she cooked another
[02:20:44] one and man I felt so good bro just eating like one big slab of prime rib a day yeah
[02:20:50] and I just was like mm-hmm so good diet and then the sleep works out and the and so so
[02:20:59] everything matters right everything matters you you and I are very similar in that I don't
[02:21:05] stress or anything either and by and large I think it's because I don't really remember
[02:21:08] I don't remember all the stuff I have to do if I remember if I could remember all of it
[02:21:13] I'd be I might be stressed but you know stress women's get a bad rap because everything so
[02:21:17] that is negative it's not negative right with no stress woman you die right stress
[02:21:22] women's keep you alert in proportion to your environment so if you're doing something that's
[02:21:26] really intense you want to be able to stress right you want stress hormones because that's
[02:21:29] kind of adrenaline nor adrenaline and that's amping you up making you feel good that quarters
[02:21:34] all is helping us releasing blood glucose and stuff like it stored glycogen into blood
[02:21:39] glucose so it's making you feel better it's making you sharper right like there's some
[02:21:43] things that's making you sharper now it does impair the prefrontal cortex a bit which is
[02:21:46] like your executive functioning here yeah so you don't want them to be too high because
[02:21:52] like you think about you know if you're in a fist fight can you remember your phone number
[02:21:55] like probably not right because like your prefrontal cortex that ain't working like you're not
[02:21:59] going to be planning your next trip or something while you're while you're in something stressful
[02:22:04] so that you know that's one factor now another factor is if you sleep really well and if
[02:22:13] you don't stress a lot during the day even if you short sleep it's it's not as big of
[02:22:20] a deal right because the quality of sleep is keeping your stress hormones lower like the
[02:22:24] lowest your stress hormones ever are when you're in deep sleep and of course they peak
[02:22:29] somewhere in the afternoon like I've heard 11 to 1 1 to 3 like I it seems to be somewhere
[02:22:34] on noon to 1 in most of the people I test you know that as you know it as that peak goes
[02:22:42] up people are feeling more and more alert their body temperature is going up there's
[02:22:45] all sorts of like good physiological things going on but people feel better under more
[02:22:49] stress hormones and you can go excessive and it becomes it becomes negative but just the
[02:22:55] fact that you're not somebody who stresses a lot like one of the one of the biggest things
[02:22:59] I do and and I can I can put out a link for your if anyone in your audience wants to check
[02:23:08] this out it's like a it's a PDF on my website but I can like do a lander for we'll do duck
[02:23:15] parsley.com yeah.
[02:23:19] Or something like Wynton would but people can download this the most and the most powerful
[02:23:24] thing I do is seems ridiculous have people take a piece of notebook paper and like draw
[02:23:28] a line straight down the middle it's like on the left side you're right to do on the
[02:23:33] right side it's to worry so to do list as far out as you're likely to worry about really
[02:23:38] like me I I'm kind of I never really got out of but some kind of like one evolution at
[02:23:43] a time like maybe I'll plan two or three days ahead like I don't I'm not I'm not somebody's
[02:23:47] going to be worried about something in months down the road but some people are so as far
[02:23:50] out as you're to do to worry is shit you don't have any control over but you know you're
[02:23:55] going to worry about it you don't want to forget to have the opportunity to worry about
[02:23:58] so you put that on the list and then you know there's some other stuff about setting alarms
[02:24:02] and getting ready and all this stuff but the big thing is when when you go to sleep you
[02:24:08] realize like to first I have to convince you of this you have to convince yourself this
[02:24:12] that the best you're ever going to be at handling that list is after you slept well right your
[02:24:19] exercise is good your nutrition is good controlling your daily stress the best you're ever going
[02:24:24] to be is after you fully wake up right to maybe an hour after you wake up after a good
[02:24:30] night sleep so there's no sense in thinking about anything on that list while you're asleep
[02:24:35] right because you're interfering with your goal of being the best you tomorrow so now
[02:24:39] from the time you go to bed till the time that alarm clock goes off in the morning you
[02:24:42] don't ever know what time it is because it doesn't matter and you're going to lay in
[02:24:46] bed and you're going to like meditate and breathe and relax if you're not asleep and
[02:24:49] then you're going to sleep when you sleep and if you wake up you just lay there and meditate
[02:24:53] breathe and relax or like whatever if your alarm is not going to go up for four hours
[02:24:56] you'll fall back asleep if your alarm goes off 30 minutes later all right you got seven
[02:25:00] and a half hours of sleep and 30 minutes of meditation get after it go right so you kind
[02:25:06] of have that built in naturally and and I think a lot of team guys do because you you
[02:25:12] go through some really stressful shit relative to like you get out in the entrepreneur world
[02:25:17] is like that's kind of stressful but like if I fail I can just start something else
[02:25:22] like something collapses like it's not really that I mean I'm not getting shot at I'm not
[02:25:26] cold and not wet you know it's just a different scene so I think that's that's why you're
[02:25:35] experiencing which experience now the other thing to remember those like if somebody
[02:25:40] goes out for a drink right they meet their buddy at a bar like yeah you know I'm going
[02:25:46] to stop by chat for a little bit and take off so I'm just going to have one drink because
[02:25:51] I want to drive drunk right I want to be impaired and then somehow they end up having to maybe
[02:25:57] I'll have another and then by like the fourth drinks I'm fine I can I can drive home like
[02:26:01] where did that decision making shift at some point you lost awareness of your impairment
[02:26:06] you became more impaired and you lost your ability to recognize that you're impaired
[02:26:11] sleep deprivation is the same way so you wake up and you're just like I feel good because
[02:26:16] the stress woman's making you feel good right you're impaired though like we just know like
[02:26:20] it's unavoidable it's just like putting alcohol on your blood putting you know putting stress
[02:26:25] woman's in your brain make your prefrontal cortex not as active now there's a there's
[02:26:32] a there's a little bump where it's actually better right because you're adrenalized you
[02:26:37] can't do everything better but there's some advantages to certain aspects to certain behaviors
[02:26:41] but then it goes too high and it's like it's really impaired right like you think about
[02:26:45] somebody who's super anxious are they good at anything yeah it's a bummer no they can't
[02:26:50] be good at anything because their prefrontal cortex is impaired that's what that's what
[02:26:53] anxiety really is you don't trust yourself you don't trust yourself to make a decision
[02:26:58] because you know you have a bad track of making good decisions or something and so you don't
[02:27:05] trust your ability to do it and now that's stressed you out even more and so it can be
[02:27:09] a really a death spiral for a lot of people because like I said if you don't get enough
[02:27:15] sleep then you wake up the next day with more stress hormones well the absence of stress
[02:27:21] hormones is what allows you to fall asleep so if you're running around with 20% more
[02:27:25] stress hormones than you need now when you try to go to sleep you're 20% higher than
[02:27:29] you should be and it might not be low enough to fall asleep and the other thing is your
[02:27:34] stress hormones are what's waking you up in the morning and cortisol is waking you up
[02:27:37] so if you're running 20% higher than you should be running then you're sort of your genetic
[02:27:43] background would have you running at well now you're going to wake up when you hit that
[02:27:50] same level that you maybe would have hit an hour later if you didn't have the sex stress
[02:27:55] hormones.
[02:27:56] Let's talk sleep protocol for optimal sleep protocol.
[02:28:02] So like I was talking about earlier you just think about think about humans 200 years ago
[02:28:12] right or maybe go back say a thousand years hunter gatherers right we don't see well at
[02:28:22] night we're crappy predators anyways right without weapons we're useless right we can't
[02:28:27] fight a raccoon right we're so we don't see well at night the sun goes down the blue light
[02:28:36] leaves our eyes we have nerves in our eyes that sense blue light they have nothing to
[02:28:40] with vision and then that triggers the changes in our brain which leads to the melatonin
[02:28:45] being secreted in the melatonin then changes a lot of things but one of the big things
[02:28:51] happens increases the snare peptide GABA which slows down our brain we quit interacting
[02:28:57] with the world as much and our body temperature goes down because the sun went down right
[02:29:02] so it's dark we can't see we back up into a corner to be safe because we're prey a
[02:29:07] thousand years ago like maybe we get in a cave whatever we make a fire now you really
[02:29:11] can't see right can't see past the fire so your world gets secluded you're not interacting
[02:29:16] you're not jumping around you're not climbing out lifting you're not right maybe telling
[02:29:21] some stories whatever and then about three hours after the sun goes down you feel like
[02:29:26] sleeping and you lay down and you sleep your body temperature keeps going down your stress
[02:29:30] hormones keep going down some point all that you know starts coming back up your body temperature
[02:29:35] kind of hits a maximum low and then it starts it kind of fires a survival response and you
[02:29:40] start building things back up and your cortisol comes back up and you wake up right around
[02:29:44] the time the sun's coming up you don't wake up because of the sun you just coincidental
[02:29:48] right like because that's how you're wired like every and every mammal on this planet
[02:29:54] uses the sun as it's queues want to be awake and want to be asleep so that's how our ancestors
[02:29:59] did it the closest you can get to that right that's what sleep hygiene is right everything
[02:30:04] you read about sleep hygiene is that right so blacking out your windows yeah because
[02:30:09] you don't one you don't want the light to you don't want to know what time it is when
[02:30:13] you wake up right turning down the temperature your house taking a shower taking a cold shower
[02:30:21] like you want to think about what do you do as a little kid right you have a three four
[02:30:26] year old kid bashing trucks together banging drums whatever you don't just throw that kid
[02:30:31] in a bed and turn the light on walk out they need a ritual they need time to get ready
[02:30:35] to go to sleep we study hunter gatherers today makes it's like 30,000 people who've never
[02:30:42] experienced electricity never experienced electricity they still live like our ancestors
[02:30:46] live they go out they hunt food hunting gather food for two hours a day the rest of the day
[02:30:50] they're fucking off having sex playing around whatever like they're the original aristocrat
[02:30:55] like that's where we would be if we stayed in that lifestyle so like you take your kid
[02:31:01] and what do you do it's like it's time for quiet play right put that stuff away we're
[02:31:05] gonna do puzzles or you know whatever we do something more today we're gonna kind of dim
[02:31:11] the lights that stuff right and then we give them a bath why gonna lower their body temperature
[02:31:16] right because you're not gonna give them a 98 degree bath give them like an 80 degree
[02:31:20] bath 85 degree bath then they get out and you powder them up and you put them in really
[02:31:24] soft clothes right okay you're not stimulating their skin and then you put them in bed you
[02:31:29] know make everything soft and comfortable and warm and cozy and then you read them a
[02:31:33] book that they already know right they can think about something like Dr. Seuss like
[02:31:39] trans inducing rhythmic rhyming like this yeah I do not like right and so the kids already
[02:31:48] know what the story and that's why they want to read that book it's like they want to be
[02:31:52] settled down you want to distract yourself so you can overcome any of that right you
[02:31:58] can overcome any of those systems now you're still you're still gonna secrete melatonin
[02:32:05] but you can you can get past the GABA the GABA urgic slowdown of the brain right so
[02:32:12] if you've ever had an experience where you're like you wake up and you're super tired you
[02:32:17] didn't get enough sleep you were you're regretting whatever you did last night because you didn't
[02:32:21] get enough sleep and so now you're like well man I'm just gonna go to work today I'm gonna
[02:32:27] do what I have to do today and then I'm gonna come on go to bed like six o'clock and I'm
[02:32:30] gonna sleep for like ten hours and feel great tomorrow and then one of your friends talked
[02:32:34] in they're like gonna have a beer and then that's a CNS depression it should make you
[02:32:38] more tired right and you start drinking beer and like there's attractive women around there's
[02:32:44] music going there's lights so there's whatever and like you all of a sudden feel really good
[02:32:49] and you don't you don't need to go to sleep anymore and like and then you stay up to midnight
[02:32:53] that night now you know you're sucking again the next day so so you can you can work yourself
[02:32:58] past it so just blocking the light say like whatever you wear blue blocking glasses generally
[02:33:05] like you have light bulbs in your house that don't have any blue lights like all that's
[02:33:09] available you're blacking everything out maybe you live in my candlelight after you know
[02:33:14] whatever and you're getting spending three hours getting ready for bed but you're at
[02:33:18] your computer working on some tight deadline for something for work that's stressful and
[02:33:22] you're gonna work till 9.59 to go get bed at 10 no that's not gonna work so you got it
[02:33:28] you got it you you have to do something to approximate the loss of light in your eyes
[02:33:35] you have to do something to slow your brain down to where you're not paying as much as
[02:33:39] much attention to your environment and you have to drop your body temperature that and
[02:33:45] that's what it is so that that PDF I was telling you about that's really for people who have
[02:33:49] problems falling asleep problems going back to sleep when they wake up and so I have those
[02:33:56] people set an alarm clock like an hour before bed and this is a generally a good idea but
[02:34:01] like anything else if you have problems be super like be fastidious and with this and
[02:34:08] like be exact and be you know very regimented and then once you get healthy sleep back just
[02:34:15] like once you get fit you don't have to do everything that you had to do to get in good
[02:34:20] shape like you just generally adhere to those principles so like but when you're having problems
[02:34:26] like setting an alarm clock an hour before it's time to go to bed and then you spend
[02:34:30] at least that hour getting ready for bed right even if ideally you'd be dimming the lights
[02:34:37] in your eyes three hours before bed but there's ideal in reality.
[02:34:41] It will take an hour.
[02:34:42] Yeah and so okay so do that once you get in bed you have your list right you've convinced
[02:34:49] yourself that the best time to handle that list is after you get a good night's sleep
[02:34:53] you get in bed you have no awareness of the time until that morning alarm clock goes off
[02:34:59] whether you need an alarm clock or not right because if you don't have the alarm clock that's
[02:35:05] something to worry about.
[02:35:08] Here's a jockeau admission if I don't have an alarm clock and there's any like if I
[02:35:12] have to be at work or yeah I have to do something and I don't have an alarm clock I literally
[02:35:17] will not sleep yeah I will just sit there and like you know when I first started traveling
[02:35:22] and lecturing a lot I was petrified I was gonna oversleep and like not make it to some
[02:35:27] lecture so even with a couple of alarms set on my phone I kept like every every no I'm
[02:35:33] like wake up my alarm go off okay so yeah right and like that's the thing so I say hey
[02:35:40] you have a morning alarm clock even if you think you don't need it because that's one
[02:35:43] thing you're not going to worry about so you're gonna the last time you're gonna see your clock
[02:35:48] is when you get in bed and until that alarm clock goes off it doesn't matter because you've
[02:35:52] already made yourself the agreement that I'm gonna be resting relaxing meditating doing
[02:35:57] breath work whatever or I'm gonna be sleeping for the next eight hours that's it I'm not
[02:36:03] doing anything else and it's some and something on something pops in my mind I go that's on
[02:36:08] the list I'm gonna handle that list in the morning when I'm feeling good right when I'm
[02:36:12] prepared now if there's something that's not on the list get my permission to turn the
[02:36:16] light on and write it down now it's on the list right and then you just lay in bed breathe
[02:36:22] when you wake up you don't know what time it is you have to go to the bathroom go to
[02:36:25] the bathroom get back in bed you don't know what time it is so I have like the little
[02:36:29] LED red like clock by my bed that's that's not needed it's not needed in fact it's counterproductive
[02:36:37] counterproductive because then I'm thinking about what time it is you as soon as you
[02:36:40] want it as soon as you know what time it is you're you have some decisions to make now
[02:36:47] right because it's like well I start doing some mental math right like well I'm not
[02:36:52] feeling sleepy it's only 130 and I so if I phone if I can fall asleep the next 30 minutes
[02:36:57] you start thinking about stuff like that or my alarm's gonna go off in 45 minutes anyway
[02:37:03] as I'm feeling kind of awake and I got this stuff to do and I got that sound I might as
[02:37:06] well just write and so it's better to just not know and go hey no I'm gonna be I want
[02:37:11] to be at my best tomorrow my best is when that alarm clock goes off and like I said
[02:37:16] I don't care how much meditation and breath work and relaxation you get relative to sleep
[02:37:23] do your do your best to get all of that asleep but if you know an hour of that's meditation
[02:37:29] and breath work and relaxation progressive muscle relaxation whatever you want to do
[02:37:33] whatever kind of cools you out whatever lowers your stress hormones like I don't care it's
[02:37:38] like that's restorative like that's non sleeping rest has its benefits as well and it's helping
[02:37:44] with all of that stuff and as I'm sure you've heard at this point you know sleep regulate
[02:37:51] your appetite right so how hungry I am tomorrow it's gonna be determined by how well I sleep
[02:37:58] today also what I crave the only animal on this planet that sleep defy itself is us other
[02:38:06] animals only do it if they're starving or they're being preyed upon so if they're being
[02:38:10] stalked they're only gonna sleep the bare minimum if they're starving they're gonna
[02:38:15] wake up earlier go to sleep later so they have can travel further and find some food
[02:38:20] so evolutionarily it makes sense that we're wired the same way so if we're not sleeping
[02:38:25] our brains like oh are we being stalked or are we starving which is it right and so I
[02:38:31] want to eat novel foods when I'm starving so I'll eat anything right like a green and
[02:38:36] brown green and orange donut yeah let's eat that right also if I'm starving what I want
[02:38:41] I want sugar for my brain like right now as much glucose as my brain can get this is my
[02:38:45] brain is working off of glucose right I don't have an option there ketones can do some of
[02:38:49] it if you're really ketotic but it's not it's still majority glucose and if I'm starving
[02:38:55] what I want to store some fat so I better eat some fat too right so what so what's
[02:38:59] a donut it's fried sugar bread right and so like I get all the I get the fat and I get
[02:39:06] all of the you know and I get all of the glucose in me so not only is it regulating how hungry
[02:39:14] I'm gonna be but what am I going to crave and then the worst part is that it determines
[02:39:19] what my body does with what I eat right so I eat proteins carbohydrates and fats some
[02:39:26] of that's gonna be stored as fat some of that's not gonna be absorbed at all and it's gonna
[02:39:30] go out of the way since some of that's gonna be used as energy depends on how well I've
[02:39:35] slept and how my hormones are balanced and so you know one it wanted the big jokes especially
[02:39:41] on men is that you know our arts the fat that we think of as being fat right not the not
[02:39:47] the fat around our organs and stuff but like our subcutaneous fat that has a lot of aromatics
[02:39:52] in it the enzyme that converts testosterone from estrogen in your brain uses estrogen
[02:39:56] as the measurement of how much testosterone you have so if your estrogen is really high
[02:40:01] your brain's like oh that's coming from testosterone so our testosterone must be really high too
[02:40:06] so we don't need to make as much testosterone now and now you get more fat and more of your
[02:40:11] testosterone becomes estrogen and like it's this so defeating spiral I could just keeps
[02:40:16] getting worse like now you're getting fatter because your hormones are low but you're converting
[02:40:22] like you have higher estrogen levels because more fat means a more inspiring and so now
[02:40:26] you're know it's like it's the same thing of having high stress hormones because you're
[02:40:31] not sleeping well now you can't sleep because you have high stress hormones and now you
[02:40:35] know I'm not gonna get to sleep tomorrow you're gonna have even more stress and so you can't
[02:40:39] sleep because you have too much stress hormones and you have too much stress hormones because
[02:40:44] you can't sleep. Same thing with estrogen and like testosterone gets converted is like
[02:40:49] we're not making tests as much testosterone because your estrogen levels are high, which
[02:40:54] leads to higher estrogen levels, which means lower testosterone level. And that's a self,
[02:40:59] you know, defeating itself propagating downward spiral. And so like all all of the all of
[02:41:07] that stuff's non negotiable, right? That's that's going to happen no matter how well
[02:41:13] you eat, no matter how well you control your stress and all that other stuff. So then how
[02:41:19] much you exercise and the other thing I tell people all the time, which is not popular
[02:41:23] at all, is that if you're sleep deprived, you shouldn't work out, right? Shouldn't
[02:41:31] exercise. I mean, you should move, you should do activity because there's benefit to that.
[02:41:36] But you shouldn't exercise with the intent of getting better at something, right to get
[02:41:40] stronger faster more quarterly. Because like I said, like all that's happening when you're
[02:41:45] asleep, all of that's all that repair and actually getting better at anything is happening
[02:41:49] while you're asleep.
[02:41:50] I'm just going to plead the fifth over here. Yeah, I was I was going to ask you that and
[02:41:57] I was like, I pretty much know what your answer going to be because there's people that have
[02:42:00] to make that decision. Like am I better off tomorrow? Okay, I know I got to be at work
[02:42:05] by eight. I know it's a late night. It's one o'clock in the morning. My kid was awake
[02:42:10] or whatever it's midnight. My kid was awake. Do I get up and do the do the workout? Yeah,
[02:42:15] do I get an extra hour of sleep, which is better? And yours is like sleep all day. Sleep
[02:42:20] is the is the answer.
[02:42:22] To an extent like if sleep is going to prevent you from doing anything, any type of activity,
[02:42:26] then I find a happy medium on that like go every other day or split it in half or something
[02:42:31] like that. Because you need the activity. There's a lot of benefits. And by activity,
[02:42:36] I mean, you know, whatever, going on a walk doing like some zone to type of cardio, doing
[02:42:43] some movement, like you could do like whatever you could do like movement drills or something
[02:42:47] like that. But like I wouldn't recommend rolling with somebody intensely and you know, you're
[02:42:53] not doing schoolwork like actually fighting. I wouldn't do that if I'm sleep deprived. One,
[02:42:58] you're way more likely to get injured as well. Like there's a there's a very, very clear
[02:43:03] correlation between how many hours you sleep and your risk of injury. And it's and it's
[02:43:09] it's huge. It's substantial. It's the difference. There was a study done in high school students.
[02:43:16] The difference between five hours, you know, six hours of sleep and nine hours of sleep
[02:43:22] was like a 300% difference. Right. So you're of getting injured getting injured. Well,
[02:43:27] the dudes are spending three more hours in bed every day. Of course, they ain't getting
[02:43:31] injured. Well, he's getting injured in their sport. So like while they're while they're
[02:43:35] doing this work. Yeah. So we need to get our sleep. That's the so here's something that
[02:43:40] it's really interesting for your guys for when you're working with fighters, right? So,
[02:43:46] you know, let's say I'm a great grappler and I'm going as a striker and I want to not
[02:43:50] like have a camp and I'm like, whatever, eight weeks to get improve my boxing or whatever
[02:43:55] my striking. And so it so if if I wanted to teach you something and I said, that's something
[02:44:04] I do. So I'm going to teach how to type with your left hand or something or play an instrument
[02:44:09] or something like that. And I say, Hey, come in for an hour of training in the morning.
[02:44:13] Okay. And at the end of that hour, we see where you're at. See where skill level is.
[02:44:17] And then when you come back at seven o'clock tonight, I'm going to retest you. When you
[02:44:21] come back at seven, you're going to be worse than your left training. If you go home and
[02:44:24] you go to sleep and you come back and test, you're going to be better than your left training
[02:44:28] because you're actually learning when you sleep. Interestingly, if I say, I'm going
[02:44:33] to teach you something this morning, I want you to take a nap today. And then come back
[02:44:37] and test at seven, you'll come back and test better than you left your training. And then
[02:44:42] when you go home and go to sleep, you're going to get better again. So if somebody could
[02:44:45] break their day and like have a midday nap, they could essentially get two days worth
[02:44:50] of training in a day. All fighters are doing that all the time. Yeah.
[02:44:54] And like fire, that's what fighters do. Yeah, like come train, go home, sleep, come train,
[02:44:58] go home, sleep, go home, train, go home and sleep for the night. Yeah. That's like, and
[02:45:02] that's, and that's like two days in football to write like a huge, huge skill bump during
[02:45:09] those two weeks because all you're doing is sleeping and practicing. That's it. It's
[02:45:14] like, it just seems like one long day. So it's just like, I don't know, Slough woke up
[02:45:20] and went to practice and Slough and woke up and went to practice. Because we would like,
[02:45:24] you know, because it's so damn hot where we are like, you know, 115 degrees in the summer.
[02:45:28] So midday, they, you know, sent us home, go eat, fall asleep for two hours or whatever.
[02:45:35] And then you go back to practice. And but like, they weren't doing it for that reason.
[02:45:39] But you know, a lot of things that once, you know, once you start learning the physiology
[02:45:46] of things, a lot of things become obvious, you know, it's like the sleep deprivation
[02:45:51] in boot camp, the sleep deprivation like hell, we can budge. That's a strategy. Like we're,
[02:45:57] one we're seeing how well you deal with it because that matters. But two, we're also
[02:46:00] looking for psychiatric disease, right? Because sleep deprivation, you know, can things come
[02:46:09] to the surface? Yeah, can reveal that. And we're in that age group where young men tend
[02:46:15] to have their psychotic break if they're going to be schizophrenic or their bipolar, like
[02:46:20] that's going to be revealed like in their teen to mid 20s kind of thing. So let's just make
[02:46:26] it happen. It's also a brainwashing thing, like when they brainwash anyone that gets
[02:46:30] brainwashed is sleep deprivation. Yeah, you're way more suggestible. Yeah. Because again,
[02:46:35] your prefrontal cortex doesn't work and engine like you can't and you don't have it out the
[02:46:39] energy to like defend your thoughts. You're fine. That sounds like a whatever.
[02:46:44] The cooling. China is great. America sucks. Yes.
[02:46:49] Oh, man. Awesome. What else, man? Do we get is that get us caught up to the current day
[02:46:58] other than where to where do people find you? Yeah. Doc parsley.com. You got to talk parsley.com.
[02:47:04] You're on Instagram. Kirk parsley. I'm on Instagram. Kirk parsley. Yeah, at Kirk parsley.
[02:47:10] And you say you're back on Twitter. I think we were talking about. Yeah, you're back on
[02:47:12] Twitter. Yeah, I got re in. Yeah, I got reinstated. Yeah, I got reinstated because you got shut
[02:47:17] down. You got you got. Yeah, I was I was like, I was like publishing or I was like sharing,
[02:47:25] you know, published research about about what COVID COVID and you got shut down mask, you
[02:47:30] know, social distancing, like whatever. When my Instagram account, I started really with doing
[02:47:37] a bunch of videos on code because it was such such bullshit at the beginning. I was just like,
[02:47:41] oh, like everybody knows this too. It's not I'm not brilliant. It's like everybody with any kind
[02:47:46] of basic biology understands that natural immunity is a thing, right? And it's better than a
[02:47:53] vaccine. Everybody knows that always that's always been true. We acted like it didn't even exist.
[02:47:58] So like I'm pointing that out, you know, CNN has their death tracker rolling at the bottom of
[02:48:03] the screen every day. I'm like, if you did that with car wrecks, no one would drive cars either,
[02:48:08] right? Because it's like, and they never give the denominator like this many people died today.
[02:48:13] How many people usually die? Right? Oh, so it's 20 more. Right. Right. So you. So I like, I spoke
[02:48:22] out a bunch against it. Surprisingly, I didn't get banned by Instagram. But Twitter, I was just
[02:48:29] sharing some I'd like share research and be like, you know, this suggests that that doesn't work
[02:48:35] or this suggests that we're missing that right. And just one day, nobody said anything, never got
[02:48:43] an email. Just one day, I just wasn't there. And then I was like, huh, couldn't get on. It says you,
[02:48:48] you know, you've been banned or blocked whatever the phrasing was. And then and I had about $10,000
[02:48:55] or something. And then all of a sudden they're gone, like, zero, zero, zero. But all my posts were
[02:49:01] still there. And I couldn't access that many of my posts, I couldn't do anything with them. And
[02:49:06] then it was after the announcement that that Elon was going to buy Twitter. But just before he
[02:49:14] actually bought it. And I just reappeared all of a sudden, just reappeared. I got it. I got an
[02:49:22] email that time. It's like, you've been reinstated. And you can get your seat formula at docparsley.com.
[02:49:33] If you want to order that. Yeah, we're going to do docparsley.com. Chaka though. Okay. Yeah,
[02:49:39] go for your audiences. And we'll put that worksheet on there. So anybody who digs this stuff.
[02:49:47] What else? Echo, you got any questions? Yeah, couple. So the, by the way, Echo is in full
[02:49:53] support of everything you say, like, rest is at the top of his list for life. I'm telling you,
[02:49:59] right, you can't just, he's, he's Hawaiian though, right? Yeah. And why there's a very good,
[02:50:04] robust rest culture. So, um, okay, so the down regulating of receptors, is that kind of the
[02:50:13] whole explanation for tolerance of any drug? Like, you know, yeah, that, so the technical
[02:50:21] phrase for that is it's tacky fill access. Yeah. And that's not really what that means,
[02:50:24] essentially, there's, there's some nuance to that, but that's an easy way to think about it. It's
[02:50:28] just, um, it doesn't matter. Yeah, it doesn't matter what's in your blood, if it doesn't have a
[02:50:35] receptor, right? So you have, you have to have a place to catch it. Both of those things are,
[02:50:40] you could say, think of it like a lock and a key, right? So like the, the keys, maybe what's floating
[02:50:44] around in your bloodstream, but then the lock is locked, it fits that key is the receptor. And so
[02:50:49] if you don't have the receptors, it doesn't matter how many keys are floating around. Yeah. And then
[02:50:53] different receptors can bind to like different stuff, right? Like, you know, Holly, you said, and you
[02:50:58] mentioned that I forget all the names, but you know, a receptor made for a very specific thing,
[02:51:03] can a drug can be developed to be like, Hey, it can bind to that receptor. And that's how
[02:51:07] most pharmacology is. So most pharmacology, well, you know, most, most medicine, most biology is
[02:51:14] just, it's really just descriptive, right? And we figure out a way to look to see something
[02:51:19] or to measure something. And then we go, Oh, this happens. And then that happens. And then we
[02:51:22] memorize the steps as though we now know something. Like, all you did is like put names to shit that
[02:51:27] was happening and memorize it. Like you, you're not it. But then they'll fit. Well, okay, so this
[02:51:33] molecule, we know when this molecule binds that it does this. So we can like cut that out, if that's
[02:51:40] a problem, or we can add some looking, we can have something bind that receptor that will do nothing.
[02:51:46] Or we can have something bind that receptor that does better than whatever is going to bind it,
[02:51:51] right? And so that's, that's really what pharmacology is mainly about other than antibiotics,
[02:51:56] which is a different category. But most, most drugs that have some effect on your physiology,
[02:52:01] that's how they're doing it. And then is catching up on sleep, a thing? Yeah. So
[02:52:08] there's, you got some sleep, you gotta catch up on that. Well, no, no, well, it actually, at first,
[02:52:13] I was like, I heard that it is, and I heard that it isn't. And then, but then you get, so we're
[02:52:17] talking about like, Hey, don't work out when you're sleep deprived. But bro, I'll work out sleep
[02:52:21] deprived sometimes have a great workout. Yeah. You asked me to do that the next day, bro, I'm dead.
[02:52:26] So I'll never do it. So like, I feel like I use, I went into the bank a little bit,
[02:52:31] use some stress hormones, banged out a solid workout, you know, caught up on some sleep,
[02:52:37] did my full recovery and I'm, and I'm good to go. Yeah. No, it was your original.
[02:52:42] Is like catching up on that. Is that a thing or am I kind of at a bigger loss because of that?
[02:52:47] So what, so what I, what I say about it is, like, like the reason, the reason that it takes eight
[02:52:54] hours to recover from being awake for 16 hours is because you're essentially,
[02:53:01] you're essentially stripping yourself of resources and you're building up waste products, right? So
[02:53:05] every cell in your body is like a miniature version of you. What do you do? Like you're awake
[02:53:10] a certain portion of the day, you're asleep a certain portion of the day, you take in nutrients,
[02:53:14] you do work with that nutrients and you create waste products, right? And your cell has to do
[02:53:21] all of that, right? And so your cells are producing waste products. A lot of that stuff isn't cleared
[02:53:26] out while you're awake. It has to be cleared out where you're asleep, especially in the brain.
[02:53:31] So if you don't do that, and let's say it's mildly toxic, so it's causing some inflammation,
[02:53:37] and then you don't get enough sleep. And especially like you stay up all night, well,
[02:53:41] you know, you have, you know, you're going through tomorrow and you're just building up more waste
[02:53:46] products. And so that's sort of damaging you know, not hugely, it's not like it's not gonna
[02:53:52] you cause some sort of noticeable brain damage, but just a slight impairment, right? Maybe a
[02:53:57] little inflammation, it's maybe strips some cells, some nutrients or something. So I say it's like
[02:54:04] if you break your leg, and you just walk around on your broken leg until it heals, it's still gonna
[02:54:10] heal. So to some degree at some point, you're just going to become the functional new you.
[02:54:17] Now, how badly it's broken and how well it repairs will determine how good the new you is. But if
[02:54:25] you break your leg and you go see a doctor and you line everything back up and you make sure that
[02:54:29] everything's right there and you put a cast on it and you take the weight off of it. And like
[02:54:33] now when that repairs, that bone's actually stronger, but there's still like a scar tissue in
[02:54:37] there. I can still get to an x-ray and say, oh, that was broken there. That bone might actually be
[02:54:42] better than I was, but there's some noticeable changes. There's some noticeable difference in
[02:54:46] there. Whereas you didn't repair it as quickly as you could. And maybe there's a lot of deformity
[02:54:52] and a lot of problems. It's a weak metaphor, but it's the best thing I have. So paying back your
[02:54:58] sleep debt does rebalance your hormones, rebalance your inflammatory cascades, a lot of your signaling
[02:55:07] molecules that tell your other cells what to do and tell well, tell cells what to do and tell
[02:55:11] cells how to communicate. All of that stuff can be mended. But if there's some damage done in there
[02:55:19] to where like you start, you have some inflammation, you wall off some of the waste products with
[02:55:26] it with like a protein that kind of like encapsulates it, like that's all damage. And so you don't
[02:55:31] necessarily recover 100%. But you can recover your function back. But that doesn't mean that you
[02:55:36] didn't do maybe a little bit of damage here and there. Yeah.
[02:55:38] Interesting. See how complex this is? Bro, it goes deep, right? You better get your rest, Hoang.
[02:55:46] Doc, any closing thoughts, man?
[02:55:48] Oh man, just happy to be here proud to serve.
[02:55:55] I don't know. There's so much to talk about. But
[02:55:58] for people in there not sleeping well, I'd say that's the foundation. I think you get that in
[02:56:13] place. And then that should repair hormones. But if it doesn't, like, work on hormones, and then
[02:56:20] like you and I were talking about outside of it, I think anybody who has some lingering issues after
[02:56:26] that, it's a, you know, go find yourself a doctor that does good peptides that helps regenerate,
[02:56:32] helps changes the cell signaling changes what the cells do a lot like hormones do.
[02:56:36] There's a lot of promising stuff in there. You can, we can probably start fixing some,
[02:56:40] well, we can definitely fix some injuries without surgery now that used to be surgical,
[02:56:44] especially tendons and ligaments and stuff like that. So
[02:56:49] unsolicited advice for your audience.
[02:56:51] No, it's awesome. I know I always, I often get a bad rap for being anti-sleep and I'm certainly
[02:56:58] not. And, you know, even in the book, Discipline, it was freedom field, man. I wrote like, hey,
[02:57:03] you need sleep. You need to get as much sleep as you need to be performing at your optimal levels.
[02:57:10] So yeah, I'm on board.
[02:57:13] So, so, you know, I say eight hours because the research boards out that just somewhere around
[02:57:17] seven and a half hours plus or minus half an hour. So it could be closer to seven. The only way
[02:57:23] anybody really knows how much sleep they need is if they go to bed at the same time every day,
[02:57:28] wake up the same time every day without an alarm clock and they feel good and refreshed.
[02:57:32] You're like, that's the only way to know. And again, that's ideal. What's reality? Like, I don't
[02:57:37] know. There's some, there's a bridge in between those two where we're going to, you know, use gadgets
[02:57:42] and tricks and supplements and things like that, like to help bring reality closer to ideal. But
[02:57:48] that's the only way you'd really know. And that's, and it's not the same every day. Like, the thing is,
[02:57:53] to remember, this is biology. It's not a car. So we're not tuning a carburetor. Like, this is
[02:57:58] biology. It's messy. It's approximate. And you don't, you don't need exactly the same amount of
[02:58:03] sleep tonight as you'll need the next night or the day before. It's like, if I go run an ultra
[02:58:07] marathon today, then I'm like 26 hours in a row of sleep. If I do nothing but lay on my couch and
[02:58:14] watch television, I might get away with six and a half hours of sleep. Like, it's, it's an approximation
[02:58:19] and the whole idea, you know, the preto distribution, like anything else, man, it's like 80% of the
[02:58:25] time you want to be doing the right thing. And that makes you more resilient for the 20% of the
[02:58:30] time when you can't do the right thing, right? Or when you don't want to do the right thing. And,
[02:58:34] and, you know, the trade off is worth it for you. So, you know, the most important part does not to
[02:58:40] be as zealot. And the number one reason people don't sleep well, it's because they're worried about
[02:58:44] not sleeping well. Right. Because they hear something like this. Or I like, they'll hear me on a,
[02:58:49] on a law enforcement podcast or something. And I tell them, shift workers die on average 12 to
[02:58:53] 14 years earlier than they're everybody else. Because the World Health Organization classifies
[02:59:00] shift work as a type two a carcinogen, which is the same thing as cigarettes were, which means
[02:59:05] we're pretty damn sure this causes cancer, but it would be unethical to test that like we can't do
[02:59:10] research and cause cancer in people. So it's a type two a carcinogen. And your risk of heart attack
[02:59:17] stroke, like everything increases, because you're sleeping against your circadian rhythm, right.
[02:59:22] And so they hear something like that. Now they're panicked, because like, well, I work shiftwork,
[02:59:28] I don't want to die. I don't want to die 12 years earlier. So what do I do? And so the number one
[02:59:34] reason people don't sleep well is because they're worried about not sleeping well.
[02:59:39] Maybe that's one of the reasons I sleep well. Chill out. Chill out. Chill out. Do what I said,
[02:59:44] like download that worksheet and do what I said. Get in bed. Like get in bed for eight hours a
[02:59:50] night, like figure out a way to do that. That's not impossible. I realize that it's not necessarily
[02:59:58] 100% possible for 100% of people, but do the best you can to do that. And let it be what it is.
[03:00:05] Like you'll help people say, Oh, you can't go, you can't go to sleep, get up and get out of your
[03:00:08] bed. You don't want to associate your bed without with not sleeping. And so then go sit in the living
[03:00:12] room and read a book or something and then come back. And when you feel tired, I don't agree.
[03:00:17] Like I have not seen that work well. And I mean, I've been doing this for 12, 13 years now. I've
[03:00:26] been having people on this and I don't see any way around the fact that if I get up and read,
[03:00:35] I'm not doing myself any benefit. Right? If I lay in bed and meditate, at least my stress
[03:00:39] hormone is lower. At least I'm getting some non sleep rest now. So just lay in bed. And the only
[03:00:45] reason that you're going to associate with negative thoughts is if you're stressed out about not
[03:00:49] sleeping. So if you're not stressed out, you're just going, Well, I'm just going to meditate.
[03:00:52] Like, well, then it's not just a place to meditate and sleep and have sex. Like,
[03:00:56] why not? Like all those are great things. Like just be in there as much as you can be. So
[03:01:01] I think Echo's next tattoo is going to say, get in bed, stay in bed.
[03:01:08] Maybe. My son, he wrote like this commercial for me. I couldn't find anyone to work in it.
[03:01:13] To work to act in it. Because everybody's like, Oh, like all the team guys are like, Oh, it's
[03:01:18] cheap. Like I don't because it says like, you know, my badass or whatever. It's like, badass is
[03:01:23] like me or something. And whatever. And then like, I can't afford any SAG actor because they,
[03:01:29] like you got to pay and have insurance and all this stuff. And so I never did it making it.
[03:01:33] But at the end of it, he's like, So what are you waiting for? Wake up, get some sleep.
[03:01:37] Oh, that's cool. But that's like a tagline in the back. We have like t-shirts or that and stuff.
[03:01:44] Wake up, get some sleep. Awesome, man. Well, thanks for coming down. Also,
[03:01:51] anyone that's listening to this podcast right now at this time, or if you've ever listened to this
[03:01:54] podcast before, you can thank Doc Parsley. Because if it wasn't for Doc Parsley, this podcast wouldn't
[03:02:00] exist. Why is that? Because Doc Parsley introduced me to Peter Atia and said,
[03:02:09] Jocko should go on Tim Ferriss's podcast. So that, that is literally the one little pivot
[03:02:16] in my life where I was like, Oh, you know, I meet Peter and Peter's like, Yep,
[03:02:21] tells Tim, you should have this guy on. And there it was. I went on Tim Ferriss's podcast and
[03:02:26] Tim Ferriss, when we got done recording, he looked at me and said, You should have your own
[03:02:30] podcast. And I was like, Hmm, that, that could be a thing. And then Joe Rogan heard that podcast
[03:02:36] and invited me in his podcast immediately. And then in the middle of that podcast, he said,
[03:02:39] You should have your own podcast. And so between those two guys, I started this podcast. So,
[03:02:43] well, when the kind of two top podcasters tell you that you should have a podcast,
[03:02:47] you know, it's funny. The first podcast I ever did was Rob Wolse. And it was because
[03:02:56] he was at my house, I think we're doing a, one of the pre or post retreats,
[03:03:02] maybe not, but we're definitely lecturing at the same event. And so he was staying at my house.
[03:03:07] And he all of a sudden goes, Oh, shit, I'm supposed to be on a podcast. You want to do a
[03:03:11] podcast? I'm like, Yeah, what's the podcast? And so I get, I, so we sit down with like a computer
[03:03:18] between us. And, and he's, and it's like on the armrest in between the two of us. And we just
[03:03:24] talking this computer and like, I don't know, I'm not the slightest bit nervous or concerned,
[03:03:29] because I don't know what the hell it's like, I'm just talking around. And then he, he calls me,
[03:03:35] and then maybe like two weeks later, and he goes, Here's dude, you got to do your own podcast.
[03:03:41] I'm like, why? And he's like, he's at Ferris on eight weeks ago. And your podcast has more
[03:03:48] downloads than his double the podcast downloads his and it's only been up for two weeks. And I was
[03:03:54] like, what's a download? Anyway, so he tried to talk me into doing my own podcast. And I'm like,
[03:04:01] I don't know, like, when I'm going to do podcasts on sleep, like that doesn't seem,
[03:04:04] doesn't seem sustainable. Like you can't do 400 episodes on sleep. Like maybe I guess,
[03:04:09] maybe you can. And that's the only thing anybody knew me for. So yeah, I think it would be cool
[03:04:16] because I'd like to, there's lots of people I'd like to talk to. But I don't know how the work
[03:04:21] ethic and time I do it. I just like, I travel so much like I don't, I'd be scattered like trying
[03:04:27] to compress doing 10 in a day or something. I got to know, like, it's more work than people think.
[03:04:33] It's a lot of work. It's a lot of work. Yeah. I think people don't realize what goes into it. But
[03:04:38] well, like I said, if it wasn't for you, introduce me to Peter and then to Tim.
[03:04:43] Well, well, I think you got to give yourself plenty of credit. I mean, lots of guys have been
[03:04:48] on this podcast has not done with you. Not done with you done. Well, but yeah, we knew the,
[03:04:56] we knew the Joker legend spread. Well, I appreciated it, man. Yeah. And it's my pleasure.
[03:05:02] Yeah. Thanks for coming down. Thanks for having me.
[03:05:05] Obviously, thanks for your service. Thanks for what you did in the teams, holding the line.
[03:05:10] And, you know, especially for when you got done with the teams coming back and taking care of
[03:05:16] the teams and the team guys. And thanks for what you're doing today to continue to take care of
[03:05:20] them and take care of other people, man. Appreciate it. Yeah. Definitely. It's definitely my honor.
[03:05:25] Like it truly is my favorite thing to do. If I could just do, if I could just work with
[03:05:30] SF guys and like, I do that all day. Like it's, it's on like, you know, the communities just like
[03:05:39] cool. It's cool guys to treat and they're not fucking entitled little bitches. They're going
[03:05:44] to call me every hour. So like, like, they apologize for calling me once every three months.
[03:05:49] They're like, Hey, I'm really sorry, but I ran out of men like six weeks ago.
[03:05:54] So yeah. So it's a, it's a great community. And like I said, it, you know, the team's
[03:06:01] solely turned my life around. Like there's no way I would have achieved 10% of what I've
[03:06:07] achieved in my life if I hadn't gone there first. So like, I, there's no amount of payback for that.
[03:06:14] It's like, I'm indebted to that organization for the rest of my life. So,
[03:06:18] you know, you and me both, man. Awesome. Thanks for coming out, bro. Yeah. Thank you. With that,
[03:06:25] Kirk Parsley has left the building echo probably your most beloved podcast you've heard.
[03:06:33] We'll say it's my cup of tea. It's your cup of tea. Talking about the fact that rest is
[03:06:40] important. As you have to say. Yeah.
[03:06:43] Right. He was talking, when you guys were talking about the fast Twitch, slow Twitch, and you know,
[03:06:48] like your intermediate Twitch, bro, that was like, I never categorized even though I understand,
[03:06:55] I understand. And so I was like, like him where sprinting cool, even if I get in good shape,
[03:07:02] bro, I'll sprint all day as long as I get some rest between the sets, you know, kind of a thing.
[03:07:06] But bro, put me on the bike or running or something, bro. I feel like I'm suffering the
[03:07:10] whole time. I still do it. And then even when I'm done, if I'm in normal shape or whatever,
[03:07:15] if when I'm done, I don't feel super gassed. It's just that I'm suffering so much during the run.
[03:07:20] That's how I felt. And I wish I should have looked it up. I know we're going to cover that subject,
[03:07:24] but I remember reading an article and they had discovered this new intermediate Twitch muscle.
[03:07:31] And I was like, that's me. And I felt like, I felt like so good because it made sense. Okay.
[03:07:37] Because like I said, I was never winning any sprints. And I was never winning any 14 mile runs.
[03:07:45] But on a rucksack, we're just like, Hey, you got to put out for a long period of time and be a
[03:07:49] little bit strong. I was good at that grappling is the same. And by the way, my grappling, my, my
[03:07:56] physical genetics, they're good for a particular kind of grappling. And it's actually, unfortunately
[03:08:01] for you, it's the kind of grappling that you and I do. Right. Like you have the genetics for a three
[03:08:06] minute round or two, three minute rounds or something like this. I have good genetics for
[03:08:11] 38 minutes. Yeah. You know, well, I, yeah, and I would put it this way, yours, you're good for 38
[03:08:17] minutes going like putting on, yeah, putting on some heat. Yeah. Look, you're not exploding through
[03:08:23] stuff, which actually in Jiu Jitsu, you should probably avoid exploding into and out of stuff.
[03:08:28] Unless it's a seven minute match, you know, unless it's seven minutes, if it's a seven minute match,
[03:08:33] I'm going to, you know, you're getting the takedown. Like if you and I went in a set, if you and I
[03:08:36] did a tournament right now, a tournament match, 10 minutes would be problematic for you. So we
[03:08:41] couldn't even go black belt. We'd have to go like blue belt, like five minute or six minute
[03:08:45] match. You could win with, you know, you could win even, I would say more like a three. Okay.
[03:08:51] Three minute match, you could win six minute match. Probably going to be here. Yeah. After that four
[03:08:55] and a half, five. Yeah. Yeah. You could get like some kind of a takedown, maybe even though the
[03:09:02] problem with you trying to get a takedown on me is you, you would be too threatened by the guillotine
[03:09:06] and you'd probably not go for it. And you probably lose. That's true. See, and now you're talking,
[03:09:10] and this is not, I didn't strategic on you though. Yes. Which I would be doing anyways, by the way.
[03:09:16] Yeah. So, which is a good point actually. So look, we're talking about Jiu Jitsu here, right?
[03:09:20] Even though before we're talking about kind of like endurance and condition, whatever. So Jiu
[03:09:23] Jitsu, the mental part of Jiu Jitsu is way more important than the physical part of it. We're
[03:09:27] like getting excited and like all these things and what I'm going to do, well, how much you know,
[03:09:32] compared to how much I know, what you know about my, like all this stuff, like is such a huge
[03:09:36] factor. So just keep that in mind. So we're just talking essentially like nuts to nuts. If me
[03:09:41] in my physical attributes and a given or we'll say standard amount of not Jiu Jitsu knowledge
[03:09:46] versus you and your physical attributes versus the same amount of like knowledge, just the physical
[03:09:52] attributes, it would be problematic for me anything after four and a half minutes, I would say.
[03:09:59] That's if we were even on everything else, even on knowledge basically. Yeah. Because we're both
[03:10:04] about, I mean, we're both like 225. Yeah. And we're both the same height. And so, so that's a
[03:10:10] pretty good even match. Yeah. But I just know more than you do. Yeah. But if we took that away
[03:10:16] and we were just you against me with the same brain, the same knowledge, you'd be good for
[03:10:22] a little bit of time. Actually, I might, I could probably turn up the heat for a good two, two and
[03:10:27] a half minutes and maybe get the better. But bro, that heaviness and that like after a while,
[03:10:33] I'm like, bro, just just kill me. Yeah. And I could survive two and a half minutes pretty much
[03:10:37] with any. So that makes sense when you're talking about the rock where like someone like me would
[03:10:42] be like, rock this light, do that for like 1020 30 minutes, bro, no ways. I want to want to take
[03:10:49] that thing off. Like after a few minutes or whatever, but it'll feel like that'll get heavy
[03:10:53] real quick. And then you and then an endurance guy, brother, things can be heavy immediately.
[03:11:00] Yeah. Like it's kind of two, like I can jog pretty easily even with a rock, even with a rock that's
[03:11:06] like 75 pounds, I can jog like jog. It's going to put a hurt on some guys that are a little bit
[03:11:14] smaller, you know, or that have so much endurance muscle. So it made sense, man. And thinking back
[03:11:19] to all my experiences where I'm suffering, you know, and again, it's not like I can't do it,
[03:11:24] but I feel like, bro, these guys running have to be suffering way less than that.
[03:11:28] He trained for a couple of years and got worse at triathlon. That's crazy. So it's crazy. All right,
[03:11:35] but I know you like you because we talked about rest. You're a proponent. Oh, yeah. One of the
[03:11:40] best. One of the best at resting. You're probably the best wrestler that I've ever known. Probably
[03:11:44] used to be, you know, the kind where like you can fall asleep. The people used to be. Well,
[03:11:48] you know, I'm a little bit spoiled where like if someone has like, like if I go to hotel bed and
[03:11:54] the pillow is not the right thickness, you know, like, oh, it'll change. Or the, or the, or the bed
[03:12:02] is like kind of like, no, I don't know. Oh yeah. Cause you stay in the luxury hotel. I understand.
[03:12:06] It's actually, here's it. Here's like a little thing I feel bad about. Sometimes I'll go and do
[03:12:10] an event for somebody and they'll put me in, you know, the presidential suite, right? Hell yeah.
[03:12:16] And then I'll come down in the morning. How was the room? And I'm always like,
[03:12:20] it was great, you know, but in my mind, I literally do not care at all.
[03:12:25] But I remember the time and I'm damn sure not going, well, you know, the pedal,
[03:12:28] pedal, pillow is a little stand for whatever it is you just said. It's too soft. No. Okay. Remember
[03:12:33] the time it was you, you went somewhere like, and you stayed at, I don't know, you didn't have a
[03:12:38] hotel or something. So you stayed at like Jamie's rental house. I don't know. So you stayed somewhere
[03:12:42] like in someone's like an occupied house. And you didn't have any blankets or anything. So you got
[03:12:50] like a shower curtain. That wasn't Jamie's unoccupied house. That was? Yeah. Okay. Okay.
[03:12:56] Brad, you told me that story and this was like well into your career. So it's not like you were
[03:13:00] just, that was like a year ago. Actually, no, there's Jocko live. It was 2020. Just bro,
[03:13:05] bro, that story like, of course made me laugh. But bra was suffering with you mentally. I was like,
[03:13:10] bro, no pillow, like, and you're just battling through it, like whatever, bro, that couldn't
[03:13:15] have done it. I would have canceled the show. A shower curtain and a rug or something. I was like,
[03:13:22] bro, no way, bro. No, no way. Jack. All right. Well, you need rest. You're gonna need fuel.
[03:13:28] Another component. It's true. As they say. Yeah. Of physical fitness rest and get that fuel.
[03:13:35] Exercise rest fuel. That's the three components for getting stronger. Sir. So,
[03:13:40] Jocko fuel. What do we got? Kind of everything now. We have pretty much everything now.
[03:13:45] So we'll go discipline. That's the energy drink, new paradigm, all healthy. No, not healthy, all
[03:13:51] healthy. No sugar, no preservatives, no nothing and tastes good. All upside. Yeah. All upside.
[03:13:57] Also, Mooc. That's the extra protein. And you need extra protein when you're trying to build.
[03:14:02] It's hard to get all the protein you need, by the way. For real. How much protein you think you need?
[03:14:07] Well, you know, I usually have seven ounces of protein per pound of lean body. Ounces.
[03:14:17] It's one gram per, right? That's like the standard one gram per. Some people say 0.7 grams per.
[03:14:22] I say one gram per pound. Okay. So if you're going Jocko philosophy, that's if you weigh 220.
[03:14:30] 220 grams of protein. Yep. You got 30 grams of protein, one can of tuna. 30. So you need,
[03:14:40] how many of those? A lot. It's freaking a lot in one day, bro. That's a lot of protein.
[03:14:45] Now, if you eat steaks, it's like, I was like, I have to work it out for you.
[03:14:52] If you eat a steak that's like, like what, 50? 50 grams of protein? Yeah.
[03:14:56] Yeah. So you need four steaks in one day, but I get real. You know, not all of us can eat four
[03:15:00] steaks, but when you get the roll the mokin through the equation, right? Easy money. And it tastes
[03:15:05] good. It's like a dessert. It ain't going to help you with your math, though, Bernadette.
[03:15:09] That's what the discipline is for right there. Anyway, we've got some other stuff. Stuff for
[03:15:15] your joints, keep you in the game. Creatine. Back on the creatine train. Yeah. Right. That was a thing.
[03:15:21] And then because it's so, it's so well studied. That's the cool thing about it. Yeah. And the
[03:15:26] cool thing about it now is they're finding it's not just, it's not just for getting stronger.
[03:15:29] There's all kinds of, there's cognitive benefits. There's health benefits. So creatine, we just
[03:15:34] rolled out with that joint warfare, super grill immunity stuff. It's kind of everything. You
[03:15:42] know what I have to remember how this is a real thing, getting sick when you take a break. Remember
[03:15:47] that? Getting sick when you take a break. It was Huberman. If I was telling Huberman, or he mentioned
[03:15:53] something about when your body kind of when your mind stands down, like, oh, you have a break now,
[03:15:59] your body's like, oh, cool, we can get sick now real quick. Just get, you know, and that happens.
[03:16:03] That has happened to me like legitimately five times in the past 20 years where I had, okay,
[03:16:11] I've been going up, going hard, working really hard. And then I finally get a break and I immediately
[03:16:14] get sick. And so I'm, you know, cranking the cold war to keep that stuff at bay.
[03:16:22] Yeah, all that anti-inflammatory stuff, man, is good.
[03:16:25] Jocofuel.com.

[03:20:44] Doc Parsley. And for us, Echo, is that Echo Charles? He's back on Twitter, by the way.
[03:20:50] Are you engaging? Sparsely. But you know, I'm gonna engage more, I think. I hope. I'm gonna try.
[03:21:00] Maybe. Well, anyways, I guess it's not really worth following Echo Charles on Twitter if he's got
[03:21:05] that kind of attitude. I'm on Twitter. I'm on Facebook. I'm on the Instagram. Echo Charles on
[03:21:11] all those things too. Echoes at Echo Charles. I'm at Jocko Willink. Watch out for the algorithm.
[03:21:15] It'll get you. Thanks to, again, to Doc Parsley for what he's doing and what he has done. And thanks
[03:21:23] to people out there in uniform, pushing your body to the breaking point to protect our great nation.
[03:21:30] That's what Doc was talking about. You do that job, whatever you're doing in uniform,
[03:21:36] and you're sacrificing your body to protect the country. So we thank you all for what you do,
[03:21:43] everyone in uniform. And the same goes for police and law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,
[03:21:46] EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all first responders.
[03:21:51] You heard what Doc said about shift work when you're staying up opposite hours and every one
[03:21:56] of those jobs I just mentioned, you all do that. You also sacrifice your bodies to keep us safe.
[03:22:04] So thank you for what you all do every day. And everyone else out there.
[03:22:07] Yeah, look, you got to push hard. But you do need to get rest. You do need to recover. That is critical
[03:22:18] for growth and for health. That being said, just do me a favor. Don't lie to yourself.
[03:22:27] Because there's some people are going to take this and run with it. They're going to make rest the
[03:22:31] priority of their existence. And I'm not saying, look, I'm not saying don't rest, rest. You heard
[03:22:36] me. You heard Doc, you heard Echo Charles chiming in. But when it's time to get up, get up and use
[03:22:44] the day to make yourself tired so you can sleep well. And the way you make yourself tired is of
[03:22:51] course by going out there and getting after it. And until next time, this is Echo and Jaco out.
