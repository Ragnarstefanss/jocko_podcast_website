[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 366 with Echo Charles and me jockel willing good evening. I go good evening
[00:00:06] Also joining us tonight Dave Burke. Good evening Dave. Good evening Dave happens to be kind of in San Diego right now
[00:00:13] So here you are
[00:00:16] Leadership strategy and tactics wrote a book called leadership strategy and tactics and in that book
[00:00:21] I talked about whether leaders are born or made and
[00:00:25] the answer is of course both
[00:00:27] People are born with certain characteristics that are beneficial for leadership, right?
[00:00:34] The ability to simplify things the ability to detach
[00:00:38] Being articulate these are all things that you can be born with various levels of and
[00:00:45] Thankfully, they're all things that you can
[00:00:49] improve
[00:00:50] Right, you can learn to simplify things
[00:00:52] You can learn to detach you can learn to become more articulate. Well, it's not easy and
[00:00:59] Some people can learn more easily how to simplify things some people can learn more easily how to detach
[00:01:06] Some people have a really hard time with it
[00:01:09] There's some things that you can't improve
[00:01:12] Right, I know in the book
[00:01:14] I use the example of being able to speak loudly because being able to speak loudly in
[00:01:19] In combat is beneficial and even even if you're trying to get you know, you're
[00:01:25] You've got an event going on and you got to get everyone to move through different room
[00:01:28] It's it's good to have a loud voice and a loud voice is a genetic thing and sure you could train it a little bit
[00:01:33] But you some people can only talk so loud
[00:01:36] Genetic in my family is loud at my house bunch of loud people
[00:01:42] So it's genetic trait. So
[00:01:45] Everyone's got some level of
[00:01:48] inherent
[00:01:49] Leadership capability and when you have some kind of a lack like if you don't have a loud voice cool
[00:01:53] You get someone on your team that does
[00:01:56] And there are some natural leaders out there, right?
[00:02:01] And the I don't know how look natural leadership means that they might have
[00:02:08] Some better characteristics, but what it really means is that they're humble and throughout their lives
[00:02:14] They've developed themselves over time, right?
[00:02:16] Some people
[00:02:20] have
[00:02:22] Very little leadership natural ability and then you have everyone in between
[00:02:26] I mean, there's there's some people that they just don't they just got they didn't get the the positive leadership
[00:02:32] Characteristics and they might be really awesome at other things
[00:02:35] Right, they might be a great athlete, right? How many great athletes are there that weren't great coaches? There's a lot of them
[00:02:41] So in fact some of them are actually bad coaches. They were great player, but they're a bad coach. They've great skills
[00:02:47] Athletic skills great ability to have great peripheral vision. They have great skills for athletics, but they didn't have a great leadership
[00:02:55] Capability and maybe they never developed it
[00:02:59] Imagine if you're like the best ball player you can end up with a pretty big ego
[00:03:02] Maybe you don't need to listen to a bunch of people so maybe you don't end up being the best leader
[00:03:07] but
[00:03:09] Leadership is what drives the success of an organization?
[00:03:12] So the question is how do you develop leaders and we know we talk about all the time we do it Dave
[00:03:16] And I do it for a living we develop leaders we teach leaders we train them mentor them
[00:03:21] We put them in leadership positions put people in leadership positions. We coach them
[00:03:24] We have developed those programs inside of organizations all very hands-on
[00:03:29] So how do you train leaders if you're in an organization that has hundreds of thousands of people?
[00:03:39] Obviously you're gonna use decentralized command right?
[00:03:42] Because you as the leader in charge of a couple hundred thousand people you're not gonna be able to train everyone yourself
[00:03:47] So you have to use decentralized command
[00:03:50] So that the training and the mentoring and the coaching is going to take place at at the subordinate levels
[00:03:55] But then if you have a few hundred thousand people in your organization, how do you set a baseline of knowledge?
[00:04:03] That's gonna drive the leadership
[00:04:07] Training and drive a leadership culture inside your organization. Well a couple months ago Dave handed me a manual
[00:04:15] And the manual is called it's from the Marine Corps. I know it's a big shocker coming from Dave Burke handed me a manual
[00:04:21] It's called the fundamentals of Marine Corps leadership and
[00:04:26] For all practical purposes, it's a correspondence course, which is kind of a joke in the military, right in the military
[00:04:32] It's like oh you went to Bud's through the correspondence course meaning you just you know filled out some paperwork and then you graduated or you went to flight school
[00:04:40] Would you do correspondence course to get through this?
[00:04:44] But correspondence course
[00:04:46] It's a real thing. It's something that is necessary
[00:04:48] It's a real thing. It's something that is necessary
[00:04:51] You have to be able to educate people remotely and now it's a lot easier to do that, right?
[00:04:55] Because now we have online training and everyone does online training it's advanced a lot
[00:04:59] We have the we have the extreme ownership academy
[00:05:02] And we've got a whole new platform rolling out with that. What date does that come out? What dates a new platform January 1?
[00:05:07] Oh my goodness happening. Oh, so this will be live
[00:05:10] so we have a new platform with that and
[00:05:13] And even you know when when laif and I first started talking about having an online training platform
[00:05:20] Both of us I think laif more so because I'd seen some other
[00:05:24] Possibilities laif was just thinking about what we had you know in the in the in the navy these online trainings that you had to take
[00:05:30] They were super boring
[00:05:32] Super not user friendly and it didn't seem like a viable option
[00:05:36] Of course
[00:05:37] Covid hit and all of a sudden everyone's online everyone understood the benefits
[00:05:40] And so luckily we had kind of started the academy now and then we went hard on it now
[00:05:45] We've got an outstanding product the new the new one that's all outstanding. Yeah, it's awesome. I was pretty impressed
[00:05:50] I was extremely I could actually I couldn't have been more impressed
[00:05:53] So we've got the extreme ownership academy
[00:05:57] Um, but before that was available things like this manual were out and the manuals dated October
[00:06:04] Of 2000 so there wasn't really a big online training capability
[00:06:08] And also this is
[00:06:11] Something to think about this before the war kicked off
[00:06:16] So there's sometimes as I read through this manual that I was like
[00:06:21] We've been we've been at peace for a while haven't we?
[00:06:25] Because war teaches and reteaches lessons unlike any other instructor
[00:06:32] And you'll see some of those so
[00:06:34] Anyways, but that being said there's a bunch of good lessons and reminders about leadership
[00:06:39] And I want to talk through some of those today
[00:06:42] and also put this up as kind of an example of the type of
[00:06:47] The type of program you can put in place if you're running a large organization or if you're running a small organization
[00:06:53] How often do we talk to clients that have?
[00:06:56] 40 people but they got a decent churn rate a little higher than they want
[00:07:00] They got new people checking in all the time or like you get a
[00:07:04] Medical staff let's say medical staff you got professionals, but they might work with a different team for three days
[00:07:10] And then not see that team again
[00:07:11] There's certain environments where you're going to have a rapid turnover
[00:07:15] So it's nice to realize that you can set up a standard operating procedure that you can give people some level of baseline
[00:07:22] knowledge very quickly
[00:07:25] And and you could move forward as a unified team if you have a good plan around it
[00:07:29] And this is sort of an example that so
[00:07:33] I also really appreciate the Marine Corps
[00:07:36] Because they they have a an ability to
[00:07:41] Speak to their audience in a way that can be pretty transformational
[00:07:49] So
[00:07:50] Young marine stopped by the gym today just out of boot camp
[00:07:53] You know and you you're looking at him. Yep 100%
[00:07:56] You know as soon as I saw him I was like, yep, this guy this kid just graduated from Marine Corps boot camp
[00:08:00] You know he's standing at attention waiting to talk to me. I'm like check
[00:08:03] He's like, you know, good afternoon, sir. Yep
[00:08:06] Good afternoon
[00:08:07] When did you graduate from boot camp four days ago outstanding, you know
[00:08:11] So the Marine Corps gets that job done. So
[00:08:14] Let's go to this book the fundamentals of Marine Corps leadership
[00:08:18] It starts off by saying congratulations, which is a really like again, they're getting in your brain right away
[00:08:24] Congratulations on your enrollment in a distance education course from the distance learning and technology
[00:08:29] Technologies department of the Marine Corps students since 1920 heritage
[00:08:34] Heritage since 1920 the Marine Corps Institute has been helping tens of thousands of hard charging Marines
[00:08:41] What kind of marine art? I'm a hard charger. You got this, but you're already hard charging
[00:08:44] You're already in the game like you
[00:08:47] In to improve their technical job performance skills through distance learning by enrolling in this course
[00:08:52] You have shown a desire to improve the skills you have and master
[00:08:56] master new skills to enhance your job performance
[00:09:00] So you can see how they're coming out of the gate
[00:09:04] And then it says your personal characteristics. This isn't a question by the way
[00:09:08] It's not a survey about your personal characteristics
[00:09:12] It's saying your personal characteristics. You are properly motivated
[00:09:15] You have made a positive decision to get training on your own self motivation is perhaps the most important force in learning or
[00:09:21] Achieving anything doing whatever is necessary to learn is motivation. You have it
[00:09:27] This is outstanding
[00:09:30] You seek to improve yourself you are enrolled to improve those skills
[00:09:34] You already possess possess and learn new skills when you improve yourself you improve the core
[00:09:43] Listen you
[00:09:45] Corporal Lance corporal
[00:09:47] Shmucka telly you are helping the entire marine corps right now by reading this book by going through these procedures
[00:09:53] And we thank you for it. You have the initiative to act of course marine corps always trying to get you to take initiative
[00:09:58] By acting on your own you have shown you are self self-starter willing to reach out for opportunities to learn and grow
[00:10:04] You accept challenges
[00:10:06] This is like the affirmations that people say but they're saying it to you
[00:10:09] You have self-confidence and believe in your ability and by the way, it's all true like these are all factual things
[00:10:17] You have the self-confidence and believe in your ability to acquire
[00:10:20] Acquired knowledge and skills you have self-confidence to set goals and the ability to achieve them enabling you to meet every challenge
[00:10:26] You are able to set and accomplish practical goals
[00:10:28] You are willing to commit time effort and the resources necessary to set and accomplish your goals
[00:10:32] These professional traits will help you successfully complete this long-distance learning course
[00:10:40] And then it goes on
[00:10:42] I could read the entire thing and just you know, we could just sell a uh, what's an audiobook right?
[00:10:46] Just get fired up
[00:10:48] But then it talks about how to begin the course and it tells you how to do it
[00:10:50] It's like a leaf through the text and do an assessment of the different phases
[00:10:54] And then study the first unit it tells you how to study because you know look a lot of these kids
[00:10:58] They you know, you know, if you're unless in the Marine Corps you may or may not have paid attention to one class in your entire high school, right?
[00:11:06] And then you're preparing for the final exam and it tells you gives you these unused unused minutes
[00:11:13] Apply what you have learned use the shakedown cruise technique
[00:11:18] Ask another marine to lend a hand by asking questions about the course choose a particular study unit and let your buddy fire away
[00:11:23] This technique can be interesting and challenging for both of you
[00:11:26] just give you
[00:11:28] If you followed what the Marine Corps told you to do you'd be an outstanding marine
[00:11:34] The sooner you complete your course the sooner you can better yourself by applying what you learned
[00:11:39] However, you have two years from the date of enrollment to complete this course. I hope it doesn't take so many two years to complete this
[00:11:45] graduating
[00:11:46] As a graduate of this distance education course and as a dedicated marine your job performance skills will improve benefiting you your unit and the
[00:11:53] Marine Corps Semper Fidelis
[00:11:55] So that's the intro they're coming out of the gate hard. They're getting right in your head like 18 year old jocco
[00:12:02] I'm ready to rock and I'm ready to do some correspondence courses, bro
[00:12:06] Now here's the thing. This is what you got to watch out for. How does this sound?
[00:12:11] It depends on who
[00:12:13] Is reading it right so you could look at this thing
[00:12:16] If you got a did you have a have like a slang term for Marines that were just they didn't want to be there
[00:12:21] Yeah, I'm thinking like strap hangers and some other terms and there's probably some more derogatory ones that I'm I'm
[00:12:26] I'm blanking on right now, but yes, there were definitely terms. I just can't think of it. Yeah, just somebody with like a negative mindset. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:12:33] Yes, you could take uh, you know the last podcast that we did we talked about building a palace or building a lean to
[00:12:40] You could read this and be like do this is such a load of shit
[00:12:43] You could totally do that. I could do it right now. We could go back through this thing. I could laugh at it, right? It could be like, uh
[00:12:48] Congratulations on your enrollment in distance education course
[00:12:53] Since 1920 the Marine Corps Institute has helped tens of thousands of hard charging. You know what I mean? Like you can see you see what I'm doing
[00:13:00] totally
[00:13:02] Yeah
[00:13:04] And Jamie got a client from an email the other day and she was mad about it
[00:13:08] And I was like
[00:13:10] Because she doesn't have a there's like a little a little issue with the client and she's working through it
[00:13:16] And I'm like um, so she read me the email. She's like, can you help me with this email bad?
[00:13:21] And so she she read it to me and the tone that she read it was like super negative and I go
[00:13:27] I go cool. I go read that again and pretend that I'm that it's an email from me
[00:13:32] And she just went quiet
[00:13:34] Because what the email said was like hey, we want to adjust some dates on this thing
[00:13:38] But it was like the way she read was like hey, we need to adjust the dates. I was like, well
[00:13:42] Oh girl
[00:13:46] So you got to kind of
[00:13:49] You you're gonna you're gonna read it the way you want to hear it
[00:13:54] So why not build a palace instead of a lean to why not turn this thing into something awesome?
[00:14:00] That's my recommendation
[00:14:03] Uh
[00:14:04] So lesson one and the way this thing's laid out is it's like got the lesson playing got the learning objectives
[00:14:08] It's like sort of normal military
[00:14:10] stuff um, it starts off placement and purpose of the marine
[00:14:13] NCO in the chain of command the chain of command is the system the Marine Corps uses to to ensure that each
[00:14:18] Marine receives instructions for a particular task from only one supervisor each immediate supervisor in turn receives
[00:14:24] Instruction from his or her immediate supervisor. This process continues up to the commandant to the Marine Corps
[00:14:32] In this way each supervisor is a link in the chain of command from the commandant to each Marine Corps
[00:14:38] And from the commandant to each Marine
[00:14:42] That's a that's like a
[00:14:44] Hey, they might as well put the president in there that the president of the United States is in there too
[00:14:48] They should throw them in there except for the fact that they're look, you don't really care
[00:14:52] Hey, man, I work for the commandant never mind anybody else, but I work for the command out of the Marine Corps. That's where I'm at
[00:15:00] Um, this chain serves two purposes the first of these purposes to decentralize authority
[00:15:05] Since it is impossible for one person to assign duties to every marine or to supervise every task personally
[00:15:11] Assignments are passed down through the levels of command. This is called decentralization of authority
[00:15:18] for example
[00:15:21] The mess officer tells the chief cook what foods to prepare for a meal the chief cook then tells the section cook who in turn tells the other cook
[00:15:29] Cooks whenever duties are assigned to a subordinate that subordinate must be given the authority to accomplish those duties
[00:15:36] The subordinates held responsible for accomplishing the assigned task, but overall responsibility for its success remains with the marine
[00:15:42] Originating the order. This is a horrible example
[00:15:46] And there's a couple reasons why
[00:15:48] Number one, it's talking about cooks and we don't want to hear about cooks, right?
[00:15:54] Um
[00:15:55] Not that logistics don't win war because they certainly do
[00:15:58] And not that I don't love the people that make food for me when I'm in the military
[00:16:02] But that's not really what makes it a bad example. It's actually good that they're given some various things, but here's the thing
[00:16:08] The mess officer tells the chief cook what foods to prepare for a meal
[00:16:14] Right that is wrong
[00:16:16] The
[00:16:17] Cheat the the mess officer should be saying hey
[00:16:22] This is how many people we have to feed
[00:16:24] This is how many people we have to feed
[00:16:30] Make it happen. Yeah, he could be like hey, this is all we were able to get from headquarters supply. This is the you know like
[00:16:36] He doesn't tell I shouldn't tell him anything other than when he needs to get done and what he's got available to make that happen
[00:16:41] Yep. Yeah, I just really wrote down. I I was showing like I literally wrote down the word tell with a question
[00:16:47] Don't do that. Yeah, and really then the chief cooks should be like hey guys, you know, here's how many people we got to food feed
[00:16:53] What what do you guys think we should make?
[00:16:56] and let the troops decide this is authoritarian leadership and
[00:17:02] It's not the best way to lead
[00:17:05] So watch out for that
[00:17:07] Just watch out for that
[00:17:09] Besides the decentralization of authority
[00:17:11] Another purpose of the chain of command is to link different levels of command
[00:17:15] It is a way that the infantry private can talk to his battalion commander
[00:17:18] The private first goes through his fire team leader with a problem if the problem cannot be solved by his fire team leader he sent to squad leader
[00:17:23] Then the platoon sergeant and platoon commander and finally the company commander
[00:17:28] If the problem cannot be solved by any of these marines after they have
[00:17:32] They are seen in order of their authority the private is sent to the battalion commander
[00:17:35] Any marine can go as high as necessary to get the problem solved
[00:17:39] All that the marine must do is follow the chain of command one step at a time
[00:17:42] A marine does not have to disclose the subject of a request mass
[00:17:46] To anyone in the chain of command except the commander with whom he is requesting the mass
[00:17:50] This is always like a big threat
[00:17:54] Of requesting mass. Did you did you guys hear that threat? Oh, yeah
[00:17:58] Yeah, well, we'll make a guy want to request mass usually the sense of being wronged or something like that
[00:18:04] Listen, I heard I mean
[00:18:05] I obviously knew what requesting mass was and at some point in my career
[00:18:08] I was going to be the person that they were going to be requesting
[00:18:10] Did you ever have one dude it never happened never happened. What is it?
[00:18:14] Basically like and I know jocke had to but like you want you want to make sure marines understand that they they
[00:18:20] They do have the latitude that if somehow that there's there's there's some misconduct occurring in their chain of command
[00:18:27] They can go up the chain to the right authority
[00:18:30] To to have their grievance error. They're concerned, you know articulated to the boss
[00:18:33] So something somebody isn't getting the way so you can go up through the chain and I can actually skip my boss
[00:18:38] I'm it's rudimentary in this example, but I can skip my boss and go to the the big boss if I need to request mass and like he was
[00:18:46] Describing it can almost be like a you's like
[00:18:49] A threat or like I'm gonna request massed. Is that say like in mass? No, that's something else captain's master
[00:18:56] That's that's in the other direction. That's like echo. You did something dumb and you
[00:19:01] Lost equipment or you did something dumb got in trouble now. You're going to captain's mass. Okay, so it's like okay got it
[00:19:09] But this one is this one is like, you know, I'm in an argument with Dave Dave is my boss
[00:19:14] and I think
[00:19:17] Dave's making us do a dumb plan and I could literally say I'm requesting captain's math. I'm requesting asked
[00:19:22] I'd be like jocke you're not on duty tomorrow, but you're gonna come in and it's like Christmas day or something
[00:19:27] And you're like, no, I'm not on duty and I don't have to do that. And like this is the duty roster and I have the day off
[00:19:31] I'm like, nope. You're coming in and he in theory could be like
[00:19:36] I'm gonna go over your head and I'm gonna go to the boss and say like hey
[00:19:38] I think he's treating me unfairly and and that way he's not evicted by my really awful leadership of making you do something
[00:19:44] That's dumb. We're not fair. So it's like enough or it is an official
[00:19:49] Like what he called protocol to go above above the chain or whatever
[00:19:54] That's it
[00:19:56] off discussed
[00:19:58] Rarely executed
[00:20:00] When we when we had that mutiny. Yeah, that was kind of like that. It wasn't quite official
[00:20:06] Because but we were like, hey, we want to talk to the skipper and we went talk to the skipper
[00:20:11] But it wasn't like we didn't we didn't have to go to the floor
[00:20:13] There was another time there was almost like a request mask scenario that someone was talking about but I don't remember what it was
[00:20:20] all right
[00:20:22] The purpose of the marine enceo and the chain of command the marine enceo non commissioned officer
[00:20:28] Is the lowest rank link in the chain of command?
[00:20:31] The first purpose of that link is to carry the orders and information passed from the enceo's immediate supervisor to the enceo
[00:20:38] Sporn it's a pass requests from the marines up the chain of command and let me give you a little hint everybody
[00:20:44] You're gonna be translating
[00:20:47] What is said down the chain of command and translating what is said back up the chain of command
[00:20:51] So if I'm working for Dave and echo works for me and echo says this is the dumbest thing we've ever done
[00:20:58] I say hey, sir. We'd like to reconsider the way approach that we're taking
[00:21:02] And when when Dave says tell those guys to shut up and do what I told them to do
[00:21:06] I say hey echo
[00:21:07] I did brief the skipper about this and we're gonna go ahead. We want to proceed with what we've been directing
[00:21:12] So you're gonna do translation
[00:21:15] And you're translation you're actually buffering the friction that's gonna be there because it's definitely gonna be there
[00:21:19] Uh in this manner the enceo is a link between marine subordinates and their commanding officer as this link
[00:21:26] The enceo is responsible for enforcing the orders of the commands orders and commands of the commanding officer
[00:21:30] The enceo accomplishes this by assigning tasks and then supervising work. That's what
[00:21:35] You know, I mentioned that this was this is coming out in the year 2000
[00:21:39] And you can see it's and we're gonna get to some part where they go more decentralized and they're using the term
[00:21:43] Decentralized, but what we're reading is not decentralized. This is orders and execution
[00:21:48] And following duties, right? That's what that's the way this reads
[00:21:53] and
[00:21:55] Again
[00:21:57] This is aimed at a very low rank. I've it's written in here somewhere
[00:22:00] But this is aimed at like corpils and lance corpils like e2 e1 z2 z3s
[00:22:05] um, maybe e4s
[00:22:07] so
[00:22:08] Yeah, so and I didn't read that opening piece
[00:22:11] But if when I hear enceo in the marine corps a corporal in the marine corps an enceo
[00:22:15] That's actually not common across so you're you're I see this as a way to teach
[00:22:20] Enlisted Marines e1 e2 e3 private lance corps a private private first-class lance corporal how to one day become an enceo
[00:22:28] And I'm really like man, this is rudimentary. It's almost like they're doing it on purpose like
[00:22:33] They're describing decentralized command
[00:22:35] In a way that's actually not decentralized command because it's so rudimentary like
[00:22:40] Don't tell people what to do. But I got okay. I think what they're trying to explain is like this is how
[00:22:44] This is how it works in the chaining command. It's really low level in the way that described it's described
[00:22:49] Uh, when a subordinate is given a task to supervise the enceo must also give the marine enough authority to accomplish the task
[00:22:56] But overall responsibility remains with the enceo remember
[00:22:59] Then here's a great point
[00:23:01] As a supervisor in the marines or civilian life you can delegate authority, but you can never delegate
[00:23:07] Responsibility and this is something we talk about giving ownership
[00:23:10] You know when I give ownership to dave to go and accomplish a project and he messes it up
[00:23:17] I still own the failure
[00:23:20] So um a second purpose of the marine enceo is to train marines to perform their assigned tasks
[00:23:26] This training usually in the marines m.os is a combination of on-the-job training and classroom instruction
[00:23:31] The marine enceo must be able to demonstrate and teach
[00:23:34] More important. He must inspire the marines making them want to learn the skills expect
[00:23:38] He's expected to master or they expected to master
[00:23:42] And the third purpose is to ensure close supervision and personal guidance of junior marines
[00:23:48] And this part disturbed me without a supervising enceo many tasks would not be finished properly if at all
[00:23:58] The personal guidance provides a junior marine with someone else to turn to with help or personal problems or preferences so
[00:24:06] We don't like that
[00:24:08] We meaning me. I don't know if you do. I shouldn't I say I should I don't like it
[00:24:11] I understand exactly what you're saying. So we you don't want to have a group of people who unless they are
[00:24:20] Supervised closely. They don't do things right that means I'm failing in like 19 different ways as a leader
[00:24:25] So that's that's not our goal. Our goal is not to just
[00:24:29] Have everything so supervised that it gets done because if we're supervising that closely
[00:24:34] Well, then we're too close to problem and we aren't seeing the other things
[00:24:38] We're not seeing the big picture and by the way, why why why do we have troops that aren't doing what they're supposed to do?
[00:24:44] So if you're a leader in an organization if you're working at a company and the only way things get done properly is if they are being
[00:24:53] Strictly supervised. This is a horrible sign
[00:24:56] You need to start going down the path of giving more ownership giving more autonomy
[00:25:01] Giving people parameters giving them mission type orders, which means telling them
[00:25:06] What needs to get done why it needs to get done but not how to do it?
[00:25:11] That's what we're gonna go for
[00:25:13] Yeah, you you said it already and I was thinking about this this
[00:25:17] the concept of decentralized command and how it's different from
[00:25:22] I tell you you tell your subordinate you tell your like that is not decentralized command. That's the direction which the
[00:25:27] Things flow in the chain of command if you want to use that from a hierarchy
[00:25:32] But I just I can't help but think about the the timing of this like October of
[00:25:37] Sorry, October of 2000. Yeah, like that's like 9 10. That's like right before 9 11
[00:25:42] And before that was like desert storm which listen desert from was legit
[00:25:46] But it was like four days long like it and so you have an error here
[00:25:50] And what I had what I wrote down is like DC works decentralized command works
[00:25:54] But it doesn't it doesn't become
[00:25:58] as as
[00:26:00] It doesn't reveal
[00:26:02] The necessity of it until you're in an environment by which nothing else will work other than decentralized command and in garrison you can kind of
[00:26:11] You can kind of power your way through you can you are you can still micro manage
[00:26:17] and chain of command lead in garrison and if you spend a
[00:26:21] Like a career in garrison
[00:26:23] And
[00:26:24] What they're describing and this is not to defend it like just you said it well like this is we don't want to do this
[00:26:29] But unless you've been in a situation like convent like oh crap
[00:26:33] The only way the the only way we will be successful is if we have real decentralized command mission type orders
[00:26:38] Chaka goes and makes things happen because all he knows is the outcome and I can't help him with anything else because he's off doing his thing
[00:26:43] You don't understand how not just how important is but how it actually works and there's just these little
[00:26:49] There's just like little little pieces of like garrison leadership inside that even it's like oh, that's the wrong word
[00:26:55] Don't use that word. It's the wrong word. Yeah, and without the context of
[00:27:00] knowing
[00:27:01] When and how it works and I know it's kind of like they're going to say the real world
[00:27:05] But I'll talk about combat without that you are going to use the words that they're using and they're not the right words
[00:27:12] The psychology of military incompetence
[00:27:14] Wait that book was so spot-on and it was able to capture sort of the
[00:27:20] The things that I always thought about
[00:27:23] but
[00:27:24] The the fact that in the garrison environment
[00:27:27] You can totally micromanage. You can totally micromanage
[00:27:31] Like it's like if you work at a restaurant and you only have like you've got you've got 10 tables
[00:27:38] And hey, here's the rules at our restaurant
[00:27:41] Only five tables are going to be filled at a time. We've got
[00:27:45] Five tables. We actually have five waiters
[00:27:49] and we've got
[00:27:50] five cooks
[00:27:51] And boom waiters going to talk to that cook and okay cool. Yep. Hey, you getting what they need? Yep, everything's like you micromanage everything you can
[00:27:59] Hey
[00:28:00] Bring them their bread bring the table that bread
[00:28:03] You know, you can do it. Did they get their drinks you can micromanage everything in a restaurant that has
[00:28:07] Five tables five waiters and five cooks because everything is just
[00:28:12] It's going to work
[00:28:13] And even when someone says, you know, hey
[00:28:16] Can I get extra onions? You like no no no that's not on the menu. You can't get that
[00:28:22] Now if you go to a real restaurant like a big restaurant
[00:28:26] A bunch of different people and they're like those waiters are going to have to make some decisions
[00:28:29] That cooks are going to be like, all right, we're going to get this done
[00:28:30] Hey run over to run over to Vaughn's and grab some extra milk because like that stuff's got to happen people got to make decisions
[00:28:36] So in the garrison environment, you can micromanage things
[00:28:39] But as soon as you get into a dynamic environment as soon as you get into a combat environment
[00:28:42] You have to use decentralized command 100% and in any organization that's that's
[00:28:48] Going to progress you have to use decentralized command. So yes, if you work at a completely controlled
[00:28:56] Environment you can micromanage. It's going to it's not going to be as efficient
[00:29:01] But it is a feasible thing. Yeah, it's not going to be as efficient
[00:29:04] But it's going to be a feasible thing as soon as you get to
[00:29:08] Any any kind of dynamic environment you're going to fall apart if you if you try and micromanage everything. It's the way things work
[00:29:15] All right
[00:29:17] four areas of
[00:29:19] nco responsibility
[00:29:22] Your country one responsibility as a marine nco
[00:29:26] To your country is to demonstrate behavior that dignifies the united states of america and
[00:29:31] The american people for example when you are in a foreign country
[00:29:35] Conduct yourself in such a way that the people of that country will not be offended
[00:29:39] Convey the feeling that you are an ally and are in their country as a guest friend and protector of freedom
[00:29:49] Not every marine read that section when I was in the seale teams in the 1990s on ships with the marines pulling it into port
[00:29:57] The marine corps as a marine nco
[00:30:01] It is your duty to be loyal to the marine corps policies
[00:30:03] You have responsibility to develop leadership skills professional knowledge and proficiency
[00:30:07] You develop this skill knowledge and proficiency through on the job experience reading taking correspondence courses attending service schools
[00:30:14] And by seeking new tasks
[00:30:15] You also have the responsibility of presenting a favorable image of the marine of the united states marines to both public and or sister services
[00:30:21] Community activity and friendly interservice competitions are ways of presenting a favorable image
[00:30:28] Check organization your responsibilities to your own organization or many one important responsibility
[00:30:34] This training marines as a team in developing that teams loyalties
[00:30:38] And it says here to achieve good teamwork a unit must show
[00:30:42] Unhesitating response to orders and regulations
[00:30:45] You accomplish this by demanding discipline within your unit by taking responsibility at all times for the conduct of your marines
[00:30:50] So they're going hard in the paint for the garrison life. Yeah
[00:30:54] You're bummed out you gave me this book aren't you?
[00:30:56] Well, no, I think it's awesome because I'm like I can't help but
[00:31:01] I know what you're trying to say. I that's what I'm telling myself when I'm like, I hear what you're saying
[00:31:05] I know what you're trying to say and so
[00:31:08] Inside that and you do a good job like you you can pull out the components of like
[00:31:12] This is really what you need to be doing. Yeah, and so words like demanding. We're not going to say that
[00:31:17] But but in the end I go, oh, I know what they're getting at. So I think it's actually a really cool exercise
[00:31:24] To go through this and other things and actually look and go
[00:31:27] Hey, this is what they're talking about here. This is a better way to do that or this is a way to pull out
[00:31:33] What the lesson could be even though it's not explained very well or not written very well and the other side of like
[00:31:38] It'd be better if they just did it said it differently
[00:31:41] They just did it said it differently. So like this book is awesome and everything's perfect in here, which is not
[00:31:45] Well, the crazy thing is we've covered so many Marine Corps manuals where they literally are perfect
[00:31:50] You need war fighting and it's just like, okay. Yep. This is a
[00:31:53] Totally don't change a word and as a matter of fact embrace this and put it into every aspect of your life
[00:31:57] Yeah, and maybe the thing about this and dude, we always talk about this
[00:32:01] We always try to picture the room of the people that are like in here writing this and who these people are
[00:32:06] I wonder if they like it's almost like you fall into the trap of like, oh these young Marines
[00:32:12] They need to be they need to have it explain to them
[00:32:14] It's and like no like you don't need to do that quite so much like they almost feel like they fell in the trap of
[00:32:20] All these kids are so young. They're so uneducated. They're so inexperienced
[00:32:23] We have to make this so rudimentary that they actually don't do it correctly
[00:32:27] As opposed like no, we need to explain this the way you'd explain it to anybody whether you're the CEO of a giant company
[00:32:32] No, is there differences? Sure depending on your lay of leadership
[00:32:34] But it's almost like they make it
[00:32:37] Too narrow because they maybe don't think the audience would understand it. I'm gonna go one step further
[00:32:42] I think you're right where they're like, hey, we're telling these guys what they need to do is shut up and unhesitatingly follow
[00:32:47] All orders. Yeah, that's basically it like you're gonna get told what to do and you should do it immediately
[00:32:53] Right, that's what they're saying. Yeah, that's literally what it says
[00:32:56] Unhesitating response to orders and regulations like that's what it's saying now listen
[00:33:00] Is there an element of that in any organization?
[00:33:06] Sure
[00:33:08] However
[00:33:09] Unhesitatingly
[00:33:11] What what we're getting at is I'm not gonna question anything that I'm told and this is the last thing I actually want totally
[00:33:16] And if I'm dealing with a brand new guy that doesn't know anything
[00:33:20] I still want him to go hold on sir
[00:33:21] Can you explain to me why we're doing it this way because I want him to know that
[00:33:24] Yeah, and they don't they don't reveal the fact there's a balance in any of this or dichotomy because there's actually examples
[00:33:30] You give where you're like, hey do this and actually you need your people to respond right away
[00:33:35] And when they don't you need to realize oh damn they know something
[00:33:39] I don't know and there's a reason they're not doing it unhesitatingly. So even inside that there's
[00:33:43] There's a there's a balance in that dichotomy. That's just not revealed. So you're gonna read and go
[00:33:48] uh
[00:33:49] Un whatever the word do exactly what I say when I say it like
[00:33:53] I know what you're saying, but that's not right. Like that's not what you do. What podcast did we talk about colonel pogh?
[00:33:58] What were you doing?
[00:34:00] It was it it was one of those marine corps. I believe it was one of those manuals and we were picturing
[00:34:05] Like there was one the guy kept throwing in a sentence
[00:34:08] And like it was like the last paragraph of each section
[00:34:11] It was all these awesome paragraphs and this morning like that sucks
[00:34:13] That's not right and you pictured like the guy in charge was colonel pogh who took all like his junior marines awesome writing
[00:34:18] And he's like i'm gonna make sure they also know at the end
[00:34:21] The person in charge still gets to do what he wants to do with some garbage like that and it was that I don't remember
[00:34:26] Which one is that colonel pogh? Yeah, and if you don't know what a pogh is that's a slang military term for like the rear
[00:34:32] echelon person that's
[00:34:34] all
[00:34:35] authoritarian leadership style and never does anything
[00:34:40] Real that's the pogh and speaking of colonel pogh
[00:34:44] Unit courtesy is clearly related to the unit's discipline and cooperation an example of unit courtesy is coming to attention for an officer
[00:34:53] This is like
[00:34:54] So pre 9 11 unit courtesy has a special impractical use often instructions for a mission must be given in noisy surroundings
[00:35:01] Time and effort are saved
[00:35:03] If the commander has the attention of all marines at once rather than waiting for marines to be quiet
[00:35:07] The officer should not be expected to shout over the voices of the marines and compete with surrounding noise too
[00:35:13] So
[00:35:14] Like you see they put a nice little element of truth in there like oh, yeah
[00:35:17] Oh, you're kind of like yeah, yeah, but you also you're like thinking
[00:35:20] It's like telling it's and there is I am a believer that there is truth that
[00:35:27] being a good follower
[00:35:28] Is get you on the path of being a good leader like being a good follower is important and there's just this
[00:35:33] this overarching piece of of
[00:35:35] How to be a follower is like this the foundation of this like oh when when when criminal broke walks on the reburr stand at attention
[00:35:41] Look, oh Roger that, you know like
[00:35:43] I know what you're saying, but
[00:35:45] Yeah, that followership in there is like this blind obedience is not what you want from your people when the skipper would when we be getting
[00:35:51] Ready to do like a seal team one when I got to seal team one and the skipper would come and talk to everyone
[00:35:56] Like we'd all be in the classroom
[00:35:58] And when the skipper would walk and they'd say feet that's what they'd say did they say that to you guys
[00:36:01] Attention on deck they say feet
[00:36:03] No, I would like that because it was a big change from you know, you go to boot camp and it's a tension on back
[00:36:08] And you get to the seal team one and I'm young jocco in there like you're all standing by and he comes in here feet
[00:36:14] And you're just like boom. Yeah
[00:36:18] I was motivated by some weird stuff when I was younger
[00:36:21] Uh developing unit loyalty is another of your responsibilities to your organization
[00:36:27] Just as you must ensure loyalty toward marine core policies
[00:36:31] You must ensure your marines have loyalty toward the organization's policies
[00:36:38] It's kind of strange to be talking about policies like
[00:36:42] Like in this book at this juncture. I don't know like let's talk about combat people
[00:36:48] Let's talk about every marine's a rifleman
[00:36:51] And belief in the mission. Yes
[00:36:54] And taking care of your brothers. What you're talking about. Yeah. That's what you mean. Yeah
[00:36:57] Yeah, did you wait? Did you mean do you mean take care of your your your fellow marine? Is that what you mean here?
[00:37:02] Is that what you mean?
[00:37:05] Uh, if unit pt is required, this is how you know this is how you know if unit t
[00:37:10] You unit pt is required. You must conduct real pt session
[00:37:13] You can't just go through the motions making each assigned task as interesting as possible and doing each task enthusiastically will help
[00:37:18] You develop your unit loyalty. Okay, we'll give it to him
[00:37:23] um
[00:37:24] Subordinates as a marine nco. You have certain responsibilities to your subordinates
[00:37:29] It's the qualifier of certain right
[00:37:31] You have certain responsibilities to subordinates. Actually, you're 100 responsible to your subordinates
[00:37:36] You must train subordinates in their m.os to develop the proficiency and skills marine the marine corps needs often proficiency and mos means life and death
[00:37:46] Either to the individual marine or to another marine. You must educate your subordinates in the military skills and encourage
[00:37:53] Individual self-improvement. You must be aware of educational opportunities and the unit's policies to know where to direct
[00:37:59] Marines desiring aid
[00:38:02] Cool. They want to educate their marines. This is this is
[00:38:04] When you invest in your people
[00:38:09] When you you know when you're working at a bank and you got a teller and you're like, hey
[00:38:15] We can pay for your you know to get you to get your cpa and you can become a financial advisor
[00:38:19] Like when you set people up and you invest in them
[00:38:22] You want to talk about developing loyalty. That's how you develop loyalty. You take care of your people
[00:38:27] invest in their education
[00:38:29] Give them more opportunity talk to them about what it's going to get to get them
[00:38:33] promoted
[00:38:35] Uh, it says here perhaps the most important of the responsibilities of the nco towards subordinates is taking care of their physical needs
[00:38:41] These needs include quarters and food. You have no control over building
[00:38:46] Which is an interesting thing to say you have no control over building. Okay
[00:38:50] But you can ensure that the assigned areas are as good as the situation allows by enforcing high standards of police cleanliness
[00:38:57] And discipline you can make the quarters as comfortable as possible with as with building
[00:39:01] You have no control over food preparation
[00:39:04] But by ensuring that the marines are on time for meals and improper uniform. You can make meals more pleasant
[00:39:13] I'm starting to lose it dude. I'm starting to lose it
[00:39:16] Well, here's here's one thing that's crazy me. I get it man
[00:39:20] I have no you have no control that right there
[00:39:24] I've I don't think I've ever told a person in my life. You have no control over this particular thing, right?
[00:39:30] I don't think I've ever I don't think I've ever told I certainly would never teach a group of individual human beings
[00:39:35] You have no control
[00:39:38] Over your building. I was like, oh wait a second. What are you talking about? We don't like where we live. Okay
[00:39:42] What can we do to fix it? What can you do to make it better?
[00:39:45] What well, let's let's let's get together and explain what the shortfalls are so we can pass up the chain of command
[00:39:50] So we can get some improvements
[00:39:51] We want, you know to get this the the sink in the bathroom to stop dripping cool
[00:39:56] We I do that maintenance myself like what I have no give no control over what you eat really
[00:40:01] No control over what you eat like maybe today
[00:40:05] But if I'm gonna live here and I'm in this chow hall and you don't think that I can raise problems and get things fixed and adjusted and moved
[00:40:12] Please don't tell me I have no control over something
[00:40:15] Um, there you go. I'm firing up a bunch of Marines right now. We're getting fired up
[00:40:20] This is the first time the Marine Corps at large is gonna be mad at me. I was gonna be going to the chow hall like we want steak
[00:40:27] Semper fi brothers you deserve steak
[00:40:30] Um in the field you will be the last one to eat check
[00:40:34] You can take care of your Marines needs by ensuring that all problems such as those
[00:40:37] Enquarters maintenance food quality and food quantity are brought to the attention of immediate super. So you're gonna get that
[00:40:42] Food quantity are brought to the attention of immediate super. So you're off control
[00:40:46] come on
[00:40:48] Marines like everybody else need relaxation recreation time is made available for all Marines organized
[00:40:53] Organizational sports and unit get-togethers are ways of letting Marines relax mentally and physically you must ensure that Marines get their fair share of liberty
[00:41:00] This responsibility to your subordinate Marines is as of much such importance that it will be discussed in a later separate lesson
[00:41:08] Before you can expect the most of your subordinate Marines
[00:41:11] You must ensure their well-being take care of your team and they will take care of you take care of your people and they will take care of you
[00:41:20] Mayhem out there
[00:41:21] Importance of leadership. Why'd you hand me this manual just to make me like frustrated?
[00:41:26] Uh, it sounds worse, you know, you know, sometimes I've I've told you I've told both you guys like
[00:41:31] I'll read a book like when especially early on when I read a book for the podcast
[00:41:36] And I would it first happened with the forgotten Highlander
[00:41:38] I was reading that book and I was like, damn this is a pretty heavy book
[00:41:41] But when I read it out loud, it was so amplified in my head, you know, it's so much more emotional
[00:41:48] And so much more harsh when I was reading this
[00:41:52] A few days ago. I read it on a plane
[00:41:54] And um, I was like, ah, that's kind of funny, but now it's like actually cracking me up
[00:42:01] Check all right leadership in general
[00:42:04] Well, importance of leadership. Why is leadership so important? The answer to this question is simple
[00:42:08] Without leadership, nothing requiring teamwork can be accomplished. Check
[00:42:12] Before you can talk effectively about leadership, you must know what leadership means
[00:42:16] There are almost as many definitions of leadership as there are leaders the definition that combines all the ideas is simply this
[00:42:23] the sum of those qualities of intellect human understanding and moral character that enables a person to inspire
[00:42:31] And control a group of people successfully
[00:42:36] Can we come up with a different word than control? Maybe just maybe we can use the word influence
[00:42:42] But they use the word control totally. Yeah, so again, we're talking garrison
[00:42:48] mindset like I'm gonna get my waiters to do exactly what I tell them to do because
[00:42:54] I have control over everything and I can control them
[00:42:56] Not a good sign. It's so funny, man. Yeah, they're I don't remember the exact saying but there's like this metaphor of like when someone's
[00:43:06] Um, sort of in the right area, but but but off the mark
[00:43:09] They they'll say something like and I wish I could remember it like you did in the reference
[00:43:13] You're shooting you're you're shooting on the right target, which means I'm on paper
[00:43:17] Yeah, but I'm missing the the the mark or whatever it's like
[00:43:21] If I'm way off I'm like shooting on somebody else's target like that's a real problem
[00:43:25] So I can't help it like
[00:43:27] I know what you're I you're you're sort of in the right like you're point at the right place
[00:43:32] But you're you're you're hitting all over the you're not off the target, right?
[00:43:36] But you were off the mark like we would say in the teams like you're on paper
[00:43:40] Okay, meaning like there's a bullseye. That's a little black thing. Yeah. Yeah, and then there's like rings around it
[00:43:44] Yes, you're not in the rings, but you're on the broader like big giant piece of paper at the butts at
[00:43:49] Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and island it's like, okay, you're
[00:43:51] Actually, you're you're you're on paper. I mean you're you're hitting it. Yeah
[00:43:56] We are off the mark. Yeah, you have shooting on the right target
[00:43:59] Which just means like if echoes like shooting at someone else's turn like, okay, we need like this is a whole different problem
[00:44:06] But I just like you are not hitting the target
[00:44:08] But but you're on the print. I know what you're trying to say, but you're just they're on paper
[00:44:12] But they got some they gotta make some adjustments and and that difference is is 20 of war. That's like, yeah
[00:44:18] Yeah, yeah, and that difference on being on paper versus being that's a kill shot versus
[00:44:24] Not, you know, you're you're all gonna die because you can't shoot straight totally man
[00:44:28] crazy
[00:44:30] Leadership and you know, it's funny. You're gonna see well, we're not gonna cover this whole manual
[00:44:34] But you're gonna see when they get back to sort of fundamentals
[00:44:39] It seems like they're trying to explore new territory here. That's what it seems like to me
[00:44:43] You can almost pitch like hey go back and come up with um, you know, like the best example you can
[00:44:48] Yeah, and they're like, okay. Okay. I remember this time when I was like the mess hall
[00:44:52] Like they're not remembering
[00:44:55] Rilotti or Fallujah or Baghdad or they're remembering
[00:44:59] Cooking or like yeah, which is fine
[00:45:01] But that's all they have in their repository to come out of like oh the scenarios that they want to use to illustrate these examples
[00:45:06] They don't have the examples. Yeah
[00:45:09] And what the problem here's the problem with those examples
[00:45:11] The problem isn't the example of being being logisticians in the Marine Corps and cooking in the Marine Corps. God bless you
[00:45:20] and in the Navy
[00:45:21] God bless you. The problem is they're not the dynamic situations that demand
[00:45:27] The type of leadership that we know to be effective
[00:45:31] So
[00:45:32] It just doesn't work as well
[00:45:34] If you are cooking in a combat environment
[00:45:36] You're talking about how these people need to make decisions on what what they're going to put forward like those are things that that's
[00:45:41] Decentralized command is going to is the only way it's going to work
[00:45:43] How are you going to get food to for four platoons or in four different locations right now doing like crazy 24 7 operate yet?
[00:45:51] Yeah, totally
[00:45:52] uh
[00:45:53] Elements of leadership this definition does not mention the military because leadership is not exclusive to the military
[00:45:59] We concur leadership is necessary wherever two or more people get together to perform a common task check
[00:46:04] The leader's primary purpose is to ensure that the job is done or in the words of the military that the mission has accomplished
[00:46:11] Three essential elements are needed to perform the role of a leader
[00:46:14] The leader is the first essential element the second element leadership is the group
[00:46:18] And the third is the situation and i'm not going to cover this because
[00:46:22] Again, this is something that i'd never seen before and it seemed like maybe somebody
[00:46:26] had an idea
[00:46:29] And the idea is that in these for leadership to happen
[00:46:32] There has to be a leader that has to be a group and there has to be a situation and that's what leadership is
[00:46:35] So i get it
[00:46:36] But we're not going to spend a bunch of time on it. Um, the objective of military leadership
[00:46:41] The united states military has the mission of keeping our country free to accomplish this mission
[00:46:45] Strong military leadership is essential marines are all potential leaders and military leadership should be important to everyone
[00:46:51] The objective or goal of military leadership is the creation and maintenance of an organization which will
[00:46:56] Loyally and willingly accomplish any reasonable task assigned or indicated and will initiate suitable action in the absence of orders
[00:47:09] So
[00:47:12] What's interesting is it's interesting that it says the goal of military leadership and it doesn't really say anything about
[00:47:20] War and combat that's number one
[00:47:22] Because that's what the military is for by the way is for war and combat and it can do a bunch of other things as well and it does
[00:47:30] Here's another thing willingly, loyally and willingly accomplish any reasonable task. You know what that should be
[00:47:37] it should be
[00:47:38] legal task, right
[00:47:41] Because we want to make sure that people are doing things that are
[00:47:44] within the code of contact within the within the law of land warfare
[00:47:48] And then they get it right at the end which is
[00:47:53] Suitable action in the absence of orders. That's like yeah the tiniest sliver of what we want. Yeah
[00:48:01] Even in the beginning
[00:48:02] Like I think it's that something like all marines are potential leaders like stop
[00:48:07] All marines are leaders. Yeah, just as something is marines are all potential leaders. Yeah. Nope. No everybody
[00:48:13] Every every marine is a leader. Yes every one of you. Yes. Yeah, totally
[00:48:18] It's like you said they're on paper. They're on the paper. We get what you're saying
[00:48:22] We hear what you're saying
[00:48:24] Three reasons for military leadership
[00:48:26] The first reason is the coordination of people and activities within a unit that is getting the right people to do the right job
[00:48:31] Okay, that's good
[00:48:33] Without such coordination capable people will not be assigned the right tasks. Okay
[00:48:37] The second reason for military leadership is to hold a military unit together a military unit is made up of people organized to
[00:48:44] accomplish a mission that requires a successful completion of a series of tasks
[00:48:50] When the unit is deployed a number of set tasks must be assigned to complete it again, it's all top down
[00:48:56] This is like this is the the top down manual
[00:49:02] The unit must be inspected to ensure readiness training schedules must be prepared in logistics plans
[00:49:07] Must be made up because it would be difficult for one leader to do all things alone
[00:49:11] Unit leaders are needed. Okay, so we want a little decentralized command. Thank you
[00:49:15] In the marine corps these unit leaders
[00:49:17] form a chain of command from a command on
[00:49:20] on down to the smallest unit so
[00:49:22] Third reason for military leadership is to ensure a unit success the unit achieve success by accomplishing the assigned mission
[00:49:31] Through demonstration motivation and hard work leaders ensure that all missions are accomplished
[00:49:35] A leader's failure to ensure that subordinates accomplish their task leads the failure of a unit to accomplish its mission
[00:49:40] And thus failure of the military service and carrying out a larger mission
[00:49:43] And if the military service fails our country and way of life are in danger, okay
[00:49:47] Somebody cool wrote that little section and didn't get too heavily edited by colonel pogh
[00:49:54] Responsibilities of leadership leadership implies responsibility
[00:49:59] Within the military structure there are two general areas of responsibility for every leader in every situation
[00:50:04] They are one the responsibility for ensuring that the mission is accomplished and two the responsibility to the subordinates
[00:50:10] Who work to accomplish that mission excellent, right?
[00:50:14] Completion of the mission is the first priority of leadership
[00:50:18] I swear I was just about to say I wish he had just reversed those two like in the previous paragraph
[00:50:24] Like the way he wrote it in order and here's the thing
[00:50:29] These these two
[00:50:30] the the men and the mission the subordinates and the mission taking care of the and and
[00:50:37] Putting the mission as the priority listen
[00:50:44] There are times and that's that's what the military does the military
[00:50:49] has to sacrifice
[00:50:51] Or at least put at risk their troops in order to accomplish the mission sometimes
[00:50:56] But if you continually put the mission above the troops you won't have any more troops
[00:51:04] And by the way, you'll probably have a mutiny as well
[00:51:07] Totally because if you're just throwing people to die to accomplish the mission
[00:51:13] Then they're going to rebel against you
[00:51:17] Yeah, I mean this is I mean
[00:51:19] This is an ongoing debate this conversation
[00:51:21] I've heard and and been a part of and listened to countless times all throughout my military career and even to now even in business
[00:51:29] You know this mission or people debate and I remember when I was
[00:51:33] I was out I was on an exchange with the Air Force when the Air Force like changed their motto
[00:51:37] And I think the motto became
[00:51:39] Models are wrong word
[00:51:41] not their motto, but
[00:51:42] Some guiding principle it said like yeah, like it's they ended up becoming like resolving to like mission first people always
[00:51:49] And and the way I I heard that was like
[00:51:53] Yeah, it's really hard to articulate
[00:51:56] This is more important than that. I mean obviously
[00:51:59] We have to achieve the mission
[00:52:02] The concept of the people if you want to say the people are the mission or the people are first
[00:52:08] It's actually in the vein of making sure the mission gets done
[00:52:11] It's not to subordinate the mission over the people it's to recognize is the number one thing I have
[00:52:16] For me to make sure that I'm successful in my mission, which you could say is the most important thing
[00:52:23] Is my people and if you can recognize that then all of a sudden you don't this isn't a debate of like what's more important than the other
[00:52:29] But if you get them out of order
[00:52:32] You undermine your ability to be successful in that mission because without your people it will not happen and in fact
[00:52:39] The best thing I can do to be successful in my mission
[00:52:43] Is put my people ahead of myself and the chance of me being successful in the mission go up. Yeah
[00:52:50] The other thing is
[00:52:52] When you accomplish your mission
[00:52:56] Even with sacrifice
[00:52:59] You should the it should be a win for everyone
[00:53:04] So if you're doing missions where there's not like every single person should be saying yes
[00:53:08] This is what I want to do because I want to take I want to protect our way of life
[00:53:11] I want to protect freedom. I want to protect my family. I want to protect my country in order to do that
[00:53:15] I want to do this mission
[00:53:17] So when you accomplish when you execute you plan and execute and accomplish a mission
[00:53:22] You have the mission is taking care of the people, right? That's what should be happening
[00:53:28] You shouldn't be going. Oh
[00:53:31] We're going to go and do this mission
[00:53:32] But no one in my platoon will benefit every single person in your platoon should benefit from executing a mission
[00:53:38] Because you're protecting their families their way of life
[00:53:40] Like that's what we're doing and and nowhere is that more true than in combat? Yeah, and that's that's how that manifests itself
[00:53:48] That's how it becomes to be so real when you're in a leadership position
[00:53:52] Is that concept of the meaning behind those mission is like you would never send your seals out on a mission
[00:53:59] That didn't do anything to accomplish the mission and in that same vein you wrote about it that is the
[00:54:04] In the core of that is the ultimate dichotomy is you care about your people enough
[00:54:07] That you know when you send them out there
[00:54:11] They might not come back and the balance of inside that but that reveals itself
[00:54:16] And magnifies itself so much in war
[00:54:18] That understanding of what am I actually having to go do and and I wouldn't waste
[00:54:22] An ounce of human life on something that doesn't actually help us win
[00:54:25] But if it does
[00:54:27] The risk of that is they don't come back
[00:54:29] Yeah
[00:54:32] Gets into this
[00:54:34] section here leadership styles
[00:54:36] There are two extremes in leadership styles
[00:54:39] The authoritarian
[00:54:41] autocratic and the persuasive
[00:54:43] democratic
[00:54:45] Each leader is free to choose a style of leadership
[00:54:51] Oh
[00:54:52] The choice of leadership style is influenced by situation
[00:54:56] By the situation the subordinates and the leaders personality
[00:54:59] Authoritarian style the authoritarian leader leads by personal control
[00:55:03] Characteristics of the authoritarian leader style are as file are as follows
[00:55:10] Let's support let's subordinates know he is in charge
[00:55:15] Makes subordinates into a team but remains outside the team membership
[00:55:20] Tells subordinates what to do and how to do it
[00:55:23] Makes all decisions without asking for suggestions
[00:55:27] And then there's the persuasive style the persuasive leader uses personality to lead and influence
[00:55:34] Subordinates characteristics of the per persuasive leadership style are as follows doesn't emphasize that he's in charge
[00:55:42] Develop subordinates into a team of which the leader is a member
[00:55:47] Asks subordinates to do their jobs
[00:55:50] Makes the decision
[00:55:52] But asks for listens to and sometimes takes subordinates advice
[00:56:00] Oh, it's beautiful. I like I like how it like even in the extreme example of the persuasive style
[00:56:07] It's sometimes going to take the advice
[00:56:09] You know and still have to make sure that he's making the decision. Yeah
[00:56:14] Um, so that's that's good stuff
[00:56:16] And it says that the two styles of leadership mentioned above are the extremes
[00:56:20] Each style has its bad and good points
[00:56:25] What are the good points of the first one like letting everyone know i'm in charge
[00:56:29] Making people in a team but not being a part of it telling supporters what to do and how to do it and making decisions without ever
[00:56:34] There's like
[00:56:38] Dang man, and how about like oh hey by the way you're jaco, you're free to pick what everyone you want to go
[00:56:43] However, you want to do this is up to like not one as good and one as bad. Yep. It just you know, you can pick which one
[00:56:49] Um
[00:56:51] As displayed in front of subordinates the authoritarian must be perfect or the subordinates will lose respect for the leader
[00:56:57] That's that's a great. That's you know, so hey look if you want to be authoritarian, obviously just be perfect
[00:57:02] That's you know, hey just go ahead and be perfect
[00:57:05] Uh, the persuasive leader must be very alert that subordinates won't play on friendships to get out of doing their work
[00:57:13] Oh gosh
[00:57:14] Very few marine leaders are strictly authoritarian or strictly persuasive. So we finally get a taste of some dichotic values
[00:57:20] Yeah
[00:57:21] Most of them fall somewhere between the two styles taking bits and pieces from each the pieces used from each style are determined
[00:57:26] By the individual leader the subordinates in the situation at the time
[00:57:31] Every marine from private to general needs leadership whether marines are aware of it or not
[00:57:35] They seek leadership and it goes into talk about these tangible
[00:57:38] Um reasons for needing leadership and intangible reasons for leadership the tangible things are like training instruction
[00:57:46] Physical necessities like your shelter and your food. Those are why you need leadership because you won't be able to get them on your own
[00:57:51] I guess
[00:57:53] Uh incentives if you want to fulfill the need for incentives and challenges. That's why you need leadership
[00:57:58] The intangible ones are you have the uh people have the the desire for adventure and security and belonging and recognition
[00:58:04] So those were not going to spend a bunch of times on those
[00:58:09] And we get to the leader's code
[00:58:10] Lesson six the leader's code to be an effective leader
[00:58:14] You must know your profession professional strengths and weaknesses
[00:58:17] The leader's code is a guideline to use in making an honest evaluation
[00:58:22] Of yourself in leadership after you determine these areas you can improve weak areas and exploit the strong areas
[00:58:28] I didn't think we were gonna have much this much fun with this. Well, here's a good example like the leader's code
[00:58:32] This is obviously a big deal
[00:58:34] And you've never heard of it before and it didn't make it out of this book
[00:58:39] It's not horrible
[00:58:42] but
[00:58:43] I become a leader by what I do is the leader's code. I become a leader by what I do
[00:58:46] I know my strengths and my weaknesses and I strive constantly for self-improvement
[00:58:49] I live by a moral code with which I set by an example that others can emulate
[00:58:55] I know my isn't there a little bit of arrogance in that statement. I'm just wondering
[00:58:58] Hey, you know what I'm just gonna I'll be over here just setting an example that you guys can emulate. You guys good?
[00:59:05] Uh, I know my job and I carry out the spirit as well as the letter of the orders I receive
[00:59:10] I take initiative and seek responsibilities and I face situations with boldness and confidence
[00:59:15] I estimate the situations and make my own decisions as to the best course of action
[00:59:20] No matter what the requirements, I stay with the job until the job is done. No matter what the results
[00:59:25] I assume full responsibilities. Cool
[00:59:27] I train my men as a team and lead them with tact and enthusiasm and with justice
[00:59:33] I command their confidence
[00:59:35] and their loyalty
[00:59:38] Interesting use of the word
[00:59:41] They know that I would not assign them any duty. I would myself would not perform check
[00:59:47] I see that they understand their orders and I follow through energetically to ensure
[00:59:52] That their duties are fully discharged. I keep my men informed check and I make their welfare one of my prime concerns
[01:00:02] Check
[01:00:04] These things I do self selflessly in fulfillment of the obligations of leadership for the achievement of the life of the group goal
[01:00:10] Check so make their welfare one of your prime concerns. This should be up there somewhere, you know
[01:00:14] Uh, and then you're supposed to do like a self evaluation according to this code
[01:00:22] Kind of an interesting concept and you know, look, I'm obviously I'm skipping through but they've got like suggested
[01:00:28] Activities that you can do at some time in your career
[01:00:31] You've been assigned a job which both you and your senior know you could do for some reason
[01:00:36] Your senior stood over your shoulder and kept telling you how to do it
[01:00:39] The senior did not trust you with the authority of that job. How did that make you feel?
[01:00:42] To make matters worse you discovered later that the job should not have been done in the way that you were instructed to do it
[01:00:47] And your supervisor seemed to hold it against you
[01:00:50] That he was gigged for the job. What can you learn from this gives you a bunch of little examples, which some of them are pretty good
[01:00:56] Um, and then it gives you a test and little exercises to do. So that's how you you complete these books
[01:01:06] Developing leaders
[01:01:08] Leadership traits and principles and this is where you get to sort of fundamental more
[01:01:15] Pragmatic stuff that is taken from
[01:01:18] More historical
[01:01:20] When you get into traits and principles, those are I'm guessing those are going to be like
[01:01:24] The traditional like ubiquitous marine corps JJ did type buckle those type of things that that have stood the test of time
[01:01:30] Yeah, uh nature of leadership traits leadership traits are individual characteristics proper
[01:01:35] Understanding of the 14 leadership traits will help you gain nor respect confidence willing obedience
[01:01:40] and cooperation of your Marines
[01:01:44] Check
[01:01:46] The purpose of leadership traits the purpose of the 14 leadership traits is to help you set guidelines for yourself by evaluating your own personality
[01:01:52] And with respect to your leadership traits you can find personal strengths and weaknesses of leadership by following traits as a guide
[01:01:58] You can exploit your strong traits and develop your weaker leadership traits and then talks about leadership principles as well
[01:02:05] And here's the 14 leadership traits
[01:02:09] Number one is integrity and it gives you a definition of what integrity is but then it tells you sort of how to execute integrity
[01:02:18] As leader you must have on question integrity honesty a sense of duty moral principles must be placed above all else
[01:02:24] You must be totally trustworthy for support and staff faith in you and for your senior staff confidence in you
[01:02:29] The trait of integrity is developed by following four practices. Here's these four practice
[01:02:32] Practice absolute honesty and be trustworthy at all times not only with yourself
[01:02:36] But with others never shade the truth
[01:02:38] Be accurate and truthful in all statements. Don't tell your supervisors only what you think they want to hear
[01:02:44] Tell it as is but tactfully stand for what you believe
[01:02:48] Even if your belief is an unpopular one place honesty and duty above all else
[01:02:54] So that's the number one thing integrity obviously very important next one is knowledge
[01:02:58] Nothing will gain confidence in respect of your subordinates more than quickly demonstrating knowledge
[01:03:03] And it talks about correspondence courses and reading newspapers for current events and having discussions with experienced people
[01:03:08] And it gives you the the things to do read all kinds of articles and take courses listen to experienced people ask questions
[01:03:18] The next trait is courage
[01:03:21] Courage the physical and mental control of fear is essential to leadership
[01:03:25] Courage is a mental quality that allows you to recognize fear yet enables you to meet danger or opposition with calmness and firmness
[01:03:32] Courage is a quality of mind that gives you personal control
[01:03:34] Enabling you to accept responsibility and act in a dangerous situation
[01:03:39] You show physical courage when you continue to perform in the face of personal danger
[01:03:43] Physical courage also means controlling your emotions and you show moral courage when you stand up for and enforce decisions
[01:03:49] That are right even in the face of popular disfavor admitting errors takes real moral courage
[01:03:56] To develop the leadership trait of courage you need to do the following it's funny that
[01:04:00] admitting errors
[01:04:02] Is put on the pedestal of needing real moral courage that kind of shows you the mental attitude
[01:04:08] Whoever's right this I'd be like hey brah. I mean like that's like 101
[01:04:11] There's no moral courage and said hey, you know what I made I made a mistake here for this duty
[01:04:14] He's like bro. You need so much moral courage to say I was wrong
[01:04:20] Uh
[01:04:22] This is a good one though place duty over your personal desires or feelings
[01:04:27] Look for and accept responsibilities
[01:04:29] Speak in a calm tone keep an order order new lists orderliness in your thought process
[01:04:37] And not make any physical danger or hardship bigger than it really is
[01:04:40] Stand for what is right even in the face of popular disfavor
[01:04:44] Never blame others for your mistakes check recognize fear but control your emotions. So there you go courage
[01:04:52] Decisiveness
[01:04:54] I think we might I mean we might even just call it like you never you ever been in a game where you're like, all right, dude
[01:05:01] Hey, we just need to walk away right now like we're calling the game. This one might do it to dave burk. It might do it to me
[01:05:06] I don't know
[01:05:07] So here we go next thing is decisiveness
[01:05:10] Decisiveness is the ability to weigh all the facts in a situation analyze the facts and then arrive at a sound and timely decision
[01:05:18] but
[01:05:19] Before you make a decision you must be sure that you have all the facts
[01:05:26] Decisiveness is largely a matter of practice and experience to develop the trade of decisiveness
[01:05:32] You should develop so here's why we're laughing at that
[01:05:35] There is no situation
[01:05:37] Where you have all the facts doesn't exist. I mean even the word facts is a strong word to use in combat facts
[01:05:42] Is it is a word you probably shouldn't even use
[01:05:44] Yeah, just insert combat into that scenario and no combat leader would
[01:05:53] Would they just wouldn't articulate that way because all you're doing is recognizing you have to make decisions
[01:05:59] With the void of all sorts of useful information. That's just the nature of it. Forget about facts
[01:06:04] Just like basic scenario understanding of what's going on which is why decentralized command is so important because the close you are the more
[01:06:10] Yeah, this one is almost like maybe you're off the target a little bit like
[01:06:17] I'll give it to you. This is like you just you didn't even hit the berm
[01:06:21] You missed
[01:06:24] You had a misfire
[01:06:26] So interesting, but you know when you look at the military
[01:06:30] in the
[01:06:31] 80s and 90s
[01:06:33] and
[01:06:34] Look, you but you and I were both in the 90s where this isn't me pointing the finger. This is me
[01:06:38] I mean, this is what we did was hey, we need to know everything
[01:06:42] We would plan these big missions with a 96 hour planning cycle. That was the standard in the SEAL teams
[01:06:48] Did you guys have a standard? I actually think there was I I know that phrase the 96 hour planning
[01:06:52] 96 hour planning so if you wanted to go conduct a direct action mission, you need to have a 96 hour planning cycle
[01:07:00] I have literally conducted direct action missions with seven minutes
[01:07:05] And go and launch like that's what we got to so and if you think I had
[01:07:11] Quote all the facts bro. We had like a rough grid of where the target might be
[01:07:18] Update us as we move
[01:07:19] Well, we had I mean, I think the term qrf is somewhat universal like the quicker reaction force
[01:07:24] We had a stand a standing qrf all the time which had a very short
[01:07:28] After five minutes we had some number like it was five minutes
[01:07:30] It was some at some period of time from the time that got triggered to launch the qrf was a very very short period of time
[01:07:35] minutes whatever it was
[01:07:37] The most likelihood of direct action
[01:07:40] Happened on those like if you will launch on a qrf you are going to get into some
[01:07:44] fight somehow
[01:07:46] And you had no you didn't there's nope
[01:07:48] I mean it best you like you're like yelling at the turret gunner who might not even be your turret gunner because he's not actually
[01:07:53] Like he's in the chow hall. He's in the chow hall like dude. We got a launch and so even inside that and listen
[01:07:59] I somebody wrote this and and and and that guy might be listening to this best intention
[01:08:04] Best intentions fully in every way as I hear this. I keep telling myself. I understand what you're saying
[01:08:11] That said
[01:08:13] And I don't want this to become like a lesson of oh if you're not in combat you don't understand this
[01:08:17] That's not the point at all
[01:08:18] The actually the opposite is true is the point behind that is the recognition of all these things that you feel like you want to control
[01:08:25] When you get in the dynamic environment in business in raising your kids and having a relationship with somebody
[01:08:32] And in combat and all things is the recognition is that
[01:08:35] You can't do any of these things. You can't do any of these things
[01:08:38] So I don't want to be like dave's over here like oh because I was in war. I know all this stuff
[01:08:42] It's the recognition of how much less you can dictate and how much more you have to rely on the people around you
[01:08:49] Which is why I think the frustration or some of it is the humor coming out of like bro
[01:08:53] Did you just say control like you can't control what they do?
[01:08:56] Did you just say dictate you can't dictate to them what they do?
[01:09:00] And and I think inside that is why I'm laughing at this
[01:09:02] But in all seriousness the intention behind that I understand that
[01:09:06] And I have this sense of like
[01:09:09] You're like pulling someone from the boot camp scenario and starting to like ease them into the the real marine corps and listen boot camp at ocs
[01:09:17] Those are authoritarian experiences
[01:09:19] Nobody's like hey. Hey choco
[01:09:21] What would nobody's doing nobody's asking what you want to do and it's almost like they're pulling them into
[01:09:28] Just like a step away from that
[01:09:30] My take on this is as you as you lead and train your people and lead and train yourself
[01:09:35] Just behave act teach and train the way you're supposed to without the sense that they're not capable of understanding or they're not capable of of
[01:09:43] Embracing the right type of leadership. You don't need to moderate
[01:09:48] Moving away from authoritarianism. You should say don't be an authoritarian leader
[01:09:50] Here's the reasons why not. Hey, do what you want. However, you want to do it. It's it's not good leadership
[01:09:56] but if all you have is boot camp and do you want Marines to to
[01:10:01] To be responsible or yeah, I do. I want my reins to do what I tell them to do
[01:10:04] I understand why you're saying that but how you make that happen isn't like
[01:10:08] Telling them what to do
[01:10:10] So the gap that's inside there for me is the connection between where they might have come from and I'm just assuming you pulled us from boot camp
[01:10:16] Which is not the real world
[01:10:17] It's not how you want to lead people and somehow trying to meet like
[01:10:21] Moderate them into the real Marine Corps. They've done. I'm guessing obviously
[01:10:25] uh, I think jim web
[01:10:28] James Webb's son, you know, he writes articles and he sent me an article that they've made some like significant changes in
[01:10:34] Marine Corps infantry training and
[01:10:37] They sounded outstanding and what it sounded like was it has shifted towards like what I when I ran training
[01:10:44] What we did which was like really decentralized like it was going to be mayhem
[01:10:48] It was going to be chaos and they're now hitting these Marines with those type of scenarios
[01:10:52] So that they're even more prepared. So that's a great thing to hear and um
[01:11:00] You know again, it's just
[01:11:02] It's interesting how we're going to drift right it's it's when you're in environment
[01:11:08] Where you can get away with things you'll drift towards getting away with them. Yeah, and it's important
[01:11:15] This is almost like a really good reminder. Like you said, it's like not like somebody wrote this with bad intentions, but
[01:11:22] um
[01:11:24] This is what this is what we're drawn to and the and the authoritarian mind is drawn to this even more
[01:11:32] and
[01:11:33] The orderly mind is drawn to this even more and the highly disciplined which as you know, obviously discipline is like my favorite
[01:11:41] Characteristic and if you have too much discipline, you're gonna fall apart in combat because this is not a disciplined environment combat
[01:11:48] It's not a discipline. You need discipline in combat
[01:11:50] But things aren't gonna happen the way you want them to happen
[01:11:53] And they're not gonna happen the way you expect them to happen and the marine that's been obeying you
[01:11:59] Because he was scared of getting written up
[01:12:01] He's not gonna listen to you now because you're telling them to go across the street where there's uh freaking
[01:12:06] You know machine gun fire going down and he's not going. Yeah
[01:12:10] Or he can't hear you
[01:12:12] Or he didn't you know his radio got shot like there's a million things that are gonna happen
[01:12:15] Yeah, and you're setting him up to fail too. Yep. So them the less you can do
[01:12:22] As a leader and the more you allow your team to do the better they're gonna perform
[01:12:26] So you're not gonna have all the facts
[01:12:32] Uh and now it says this form the habit of considering several points of view for every problem
[01:12:37] That's a good call learn from the mistakes of others. That's a good call
[01:12:41] Force yourself to make a decision and then check the decision to see if it's sound. Well, that's a good call
[01:12:45] Talk to people and practice making your conversations logical and clear. That's a good call. So those are all those are all positive
[01:12:52] Dependability a dependable leader is one who can be relied on to carry out
[01:12:57] Any mission to the best of his or her personality cool
[01:13:01] um
[01:13:03] It says the steps are practiced honest thinking
[01:13:08] avoid making excuses
[01:13:11] We're no stronger than avoid we can actually say do not
[01:13:16] Uh accomplish the assigned task
[01:13:18] Regardless of the obstacles cool always be prompt to perform all tasks the best of your ability. Yeah check be careful about making promises and personal deals
[01:13:27] But when you have made them build a reputation on keeping them. What kind of personal deals are we talking about here?
[01:13:31] I'm not 100 sure maybe that's like on the civilian sector. They're talking about like I'll sell you this car for 900 bucks
[01:13:40] Initiative
[01:13:42] The trait of initiative is key to being a successful leader initiative is simply seeing what has to be done and doing it without having to be told to do it. Yes
[01:13:51] As a marine nco, you must develop initiative not only in yourself, but in your subordinates as well. Yes
[01:13:56] Your marines will develop trust and respect when you take prompt action and meeting new situations
[01:14:02] You develop initiative in subordinates to develop initiative in subordinates
[01:14:06] You should assign tasks according to the subordinates ability and experience
[01:14:10] But once a task is assigned don't tell subordinates how to do it unless they ask for suggestions by allowing subordinates to do the job
[01:14:17] It not only develops initiative, but frees you to do other tasks. Yes. We nailed one dude
[01:14:22] We nailed one good job
[01:14:24] closely related to initiative is resourcefulness and goes on about that
[01:14:28] Another side of the another side of initiative is the ability to anticipate simply stated. This is the ability to foresee situations before they arise
[01:14:35] This prior knowledge gives you a chance to plan for the event and have preparations ready deal with situations. Great
[01:14:44] And then just talks about it giving you an advantage. So here's the here's the steps develop and maintain a state of mental and physical alertness look for tasks to do
[01:14:52] For a lot tasks to be done without being told to do them practice thinking and planning ahead anticipate situations before they're great
[01:14:59] The next one is tact
[01:15:01] Tacked is the ability to deal with people without causing friction or giving offense
[01:15:06] More simply stated tact is the ability to say and do the right thing at the right time. You must
[01:15:14] Use tact not only when dealing with seniors, but with subordinates as well
[01:15:18] To successfully use tack you must be courteous
[01:15:21] Because courtesy given will be returned
[01:15:24] It is important that courtesy not be misunderstood as brown nosing inexperienced
[01:15:28] Inexperienced NCOs may feel wrongly that politeness in a military command is a sign of weakness
[01:15:34] All orders given will be obeyed, but those given with courtesy will be obeyed willingly
[01:15:41] Even in emergency situations, I'm gonna get I'm digging myself a hole in the Marine Corps and I'm chuckling too much. I'm sorry Marines
[01:15:48] Uh, but quite honestly, I haven't worked with a Marine that's um in this mode
[01:15:53] I was gonna save my life
[01:15:54] I don't think you have any issues because the Marines that are listening to this are like
[01:15:57] They're like they're on board
[01:16:00] All orders will be obeyed
[01:16:03] Good luck with that. Usually you will find that
[01:16:06] Usually you will find that a calm and courteous though firm manner of speech gets the best results
[01:16:11] Tacked becomes very important when criticizing a subordinate lack of tack can crush a marine spirit an initiative criticism can be
[01:16:17] Criticism must be made in a manner that points out a weakness
[01:16:20] In the subordinates action, but still encourages the subordinate to continue to show initiative cool
[01:16:24] To develop leadership trade of tact you must do the following be considerate develop the habit of cooperating us in spirit as well as fact
[01:16:33] Study the actions of senior NCOs who enjoy a reputation for being able to handle marine successfully
[01:16:38] Check yourself for tolerance and patience if it fault correct your own habits
[01:16:42] Apply the golden rule do unto others as you would have them do unto you
[01:16:46] Let no marine superior or subordinate exceed you in courtesy and consideration
[01:16:51] for the feelings of others
[01:16:53] Cool
[01:16:54] That's not a bad goal try and be nicer to everybody than they are to you
[01:16:58] Echo charles you're pretty successful at that when you're pretty nice guy. Oh, I like to think so. Yes, sir
[01:17:03] I don't think I've ever seen you be mean to know somebody
[01:17:07] Yeah, I don't know it's been a long time. I feel like
[01:17:13] I don't know what else to tell you good courteous marine over there
[01:17:17] Next one is justice justice is fairness
[01:17:21] um
[01:17:22] Search your mental attitudes to determine prejudice
[01:17:25] Seek to rid your mind of them learn to be absolutely impartial when imposing punishment or giving rewards
[01:17:33] Search out the facts of each case
[01:17:35] Study human behavior be honest with yourself recognize those subordinates worthy of commendation or reward
[01:17:40] Next one is enthusiasm
[01:17:43] Explain and I'm going to jump them through some stuff explain why the mission must be accomplished whenever you can do so
[01:17:49] How about almost always?
[01:17:51] No one believe in your work tackle all tasks with a cheerful can do attitude believe in your mission no matter what it is
[01:17:58] Hmm
[01:17:59] Look, you got to be careful with that one. What is your mission?
[01:18:03] Why are we doing it if it doesn't make sense man? Ask some questions
[01:18:09] Ask some questions
[01:18:11] bearing
[01:18:12] bearing is a marine's general appearance carriage
[01:18:14] Deportment and conduct by your bearing you establish a standard for your periods of periods and subordinates
[01:18:20] Your appearance should show confidence competence alertness and energy your clothing equipment should be neat and clean at all times
[01:18:25] Your voice and action should be under control
[01:18:27] Few things can steady the morale of troops like a leader who with full knowledge of the difficulties of the situation
[01:18:31] Neither looks or acts worried when speaking to marines talking short plain sentences
[01:18:35] Never talk down marines or allow sarcasm to enter the conversation vulgar speech frequent loss of temper
[01:18:41] Like it says frequent loss of temper like occasionally go for it
[01:18:46] And an irritable nature show lack of self-confidence that subordinates easily see they react to the lack of self-confidence with resentment or even in
[01:18:54] Subordination avoid criticizing the entire group of marines for the failings of a few
[01:18:59] Those who didn't want those who didn't do anything wrong will resent it
[01:19:03] Your bearing should show dignity and control of both your emotions and your actions dignity shows pride and confidence in yourself
[01:19:09] and the ability of your marines emotional control shows that you
[01:19:13] have
[01:19:14] Any situation well in hand to develop and improve your bearing you should do the following
[01:19:19] Practice control of your voice facial expressions and gestures
[01:19:23] Demonstrate calmness sincerity and understanding master your emotions so that you can control them and they do not control you
[01:19:30] Speak simply and directly
[01:19:32] Never reprimand subordinates and spell
[01:19:34] Observe the study leaders who enjoy reputed
[01:19:36] No one in here regulations
[01:19:39] Demand the highest of standards for yourself and your subordinates avoid indiscriminate course behavior profanity and vulgarity
[01:19:46] They didn't see full metal jacket, maybe it is amazing like I went to ocs
[01:19:50] And those marines those marine drill instructors they never swore it. I mean, but I mean they probably swore five times or something like that
[01:19:56] What about the basic school?
[01:19:58] I mean to be quite honest like I
[01:20:01] After oc I mean even partially at ocs
[01:20:03] Like the best leaders that I worked with were were
[01:20:07] Professional and they they were articulate and they spoke professionally if I look back and like the guys that I looked up to the most
[01:20:13] They were professional
[01:20:15] that said
[01:20:19] The the use of vulgarity was I would say like commonplace
[01:20:23] Um, but even at the basic school
[01:20:26] Uh amongst the marine females going through the basic school. Yeah, I was in an integrated company like I think one of the first one in the
[01:20:32] while
[01:20:33] amongst like the marines
[01:20:35] Was everybody was cursing all the time. What about the instructor stuff? No, that's what I'm saying like the yeah
[01:20:41] Um, and I think what my point of that was it wasn't something that was policed. It was something that was I think demonstrated
[01:20:49] and
[01:20:50] Like I don't remember my platoon commander a guy who I respect I don't I have no record and it could have happened
[01:20:56] But I don't have a recollection of him cursing and I have a recollection of some and some not but like the lieutenants like I think I
[01:21:01] Cur I mean we curse all the time. Yeah. Yeah, but the staff did correct. That's the main thing
[01:21:05] That's right. Yeah, the example that was being shown
[01:21:07] It's like we weren't emulating that example the staff even though CS were pretty professional people in terms of not cursing and just
[01:21:15] Being articulate well spoken leaders was valued. Is it hard to get a billet like as an OCS instructor?
[01:21:21] Not OCS. No, I think tbs is a more
[01:21:25] I don't know if demanding is the right word and this is you know, however many years now, but
[01:21:28] No, tbs was a much harder thing than OCS back in the day to get a job there
[01:21:34] Yeah, the
[01:21:36] Marine drill instructors at OCS for me had like a their whole vocabulary of non swear words. We're words. Totally. Yeah
[01:21:44] That's a dagom friggin. I that's I remember hearing all that and and that that stayed true
[01:21:48] But amongst your peers like it's like you didn't follow that example, but yeah, yeah
[01:21:53] What's tb tbs the basic school? Yeah, so every marine go ahead
[01:21:58] No, I say you mean you got it
[01:21:59] We talked about earlier every marine no matter what your job is going to be pilot infantry or everything in between
[01:22:05] Goes through a six month course as an officer
[01:22:08] Which gives you a little bit of exposure to basically every potential job out there everything from supply to logistics to communication to artillery
[01:22:15] to tanks to infantry
[01:22:17] So every marine officer has a little sense of all the things the marine corps does
[01:22:22] so even a pilot knows what infantry men are doing and the marine corps places places a
[01:22:29] big premium on that concept every marine is a rifleman and the investment they make as a marine and even if you know
[01:22:35] You're destined to go be an aviator you go through the basic school like all marines do it's like general education
[01:22:41] Yeah, kind of like that. Yeah, so you get enough of exposure to do what we talked about before which was just
[01:22:47] Understand what might be going on
[01:22:49] You're not going to be an expert in any of it, but you do get exposure to all of it, which is awesome
[01:22:53] It paid huge dividends to me. We used to joke about it like
[01:22:56] The last time I shot a rifle before I went to ramadi was at the basic school
[01:23:01] Which is crazy. So that's like what 12 years 13 years or something basic school 94 ramadi o6
[01:23:06] 12 years. Yep, and you hadn't shot a rifle
[01:23:09] I had not squeezed the trigger on a rifle since the day I sided in my m4. I don't know
[01:23:15] couple months before I deployed
[01:23:17] Dang, but I had done it. So I had just enough like, you know, the basic fundamentals to understand it
[01:23:22] But you know, I've done everything from like 50 cows and
[01:23:26] 24 m60s of the time and mark 19s and and all that stuff that is so jacked up. It's crazy. Like like think about me
[01:23:33] Totally dude, like I had spent like literally my entire adult life just doing that
[01:23:38] You know how many millions of rounds I'd shot maybe a rethinking bringing Dave on all those missions
[01:23:42] I kicked you in my mind. I was looking at you like, hey, he's
[01:23:47] But he's a square-dweller, but he's a square-dweller. I mean rifle at heart
[01:23:50] Yeah, I shot the pistol every year for however many years, but I didn't touch the rifle. Which way does the magazine go?
[01:23:57] Oh, that's it was a steep learning curve for me to get back
[01:24:00] The jowl was like a workup. How did you get ready? How many rounds did you shoot before you went on deployment?
[01:24:05] Dude, remember man, so I got to my Angleco unit basically October of 05
[01:24:10] And I spent the first I don't know month basically doing the tactical air, you know TACP
[01:24:17] All that was I was just gonna be in Japan for a year
[01:24:20] And then around Christmas time like hey, we need volunteer, you know, I got a volunteer for that
[01:24:24] I volunteered for that job. Like hey, we need volunteers to go to Iraq. I'm like, well go to Iraq, you know, you know the whole story behind
[01:24:29] Yeah, but it wasn't till that was in January. That was in December. So for Christmas. It was like, hey, honey
[01:24:34] You know that was when I kind of broke the news like this. You were newlywed at that time. We had just gotten married. That's right. Hey, sorry
[01:24:41] So we go on Christmas to come back in January. She was thinking like maybe a trip to Japan
[01:24:44] Totally
[01:24:45] It's like this would be the blast go to see the Kota Khan. That's right. Yeah judo players. Where you at? We we go
[01:24:52] Christmas vacation the holidays whatever and in January they're like, hey all the iraq marines are going to camp lejeune
[01:24:59] So I got to camp lejeune
[01:25:01] January, I don't call it like the 10th or whatever it was and I deployed February
[01:25:05] 20th, so I had five weeks
[01:25:08] Five weeks. Do you have any?
[01:25:10] Not a lot
[01:25:11] Not a lot a little
[01:25:13] I like it was like bz ode and then I did a couple of courses, but you know to keep in mind too like
[01:25:19] I use my rifle obviously. Yeah, but my primary weapon there was the radio and you know, clearly I was I was much more inclined to do that
[01:25:26] um, but dude, I don't
[01:25:28] I I I wasn't shooting rounds of that rifle at all hardly ever did you do immediate action drills?
[01:25:36] Like with your team
[01:25:38] yeah, like
[01:25:41] I did very little of that now. I had a couple of pretty squared away staff and co's you must have been so stoked rolling out with us
[01:25:49] You must have been like hell. Yeah
[01:25:51] Like these guys have got I was mostly I was more and I you know, I look back and talk to life about it. I was mostly stoked
[01:25:59] That you were cool with me coming with you like
[01:26:02] That even to this day look back like the fact that they had enough confidence in me and my guys
[01:26:07] So we could be with you guys was pretty awesome for me
[01:26:11] Now your guys these are these are like infantry marines that get assigned to anglico. How does that work? Well?
[01:26:17] it's it's
[01:26:19] My guys were almost 100 artillery
[01:26:22] Really? Yeah, just most anglico is artillery
[01:26:25] They're not all there. There's because they serve as forward observers at some point
[01:26:29] There's exactly right that experience with calling an air. Uh, I'm sorry calling for fire artillery call for fire
[01:26:35] Um, and forward observers things like that
[01:26:37] It's not some rule that it has to be artillery, but the thing that was crazy though is my team my so I had a 13 man team
[01:26:43] My five of us that I stayed because we ended up doing missions as a small unit leader. I had three teams
[01:26:49] I was one of those three teams
[01:26:51] every one of my guys was
[01:26:54] artillery
[01:26:55] And it never deployed
[01:26:58] So it's kind of crazy
[01:27:01] That's wild. I'm glad you didn't know this back then
[01:27:04] I didn't either
[01:27:06] Damn you guys were pros though like we did all right man. Yeah, we did all right. That's freaking legit. It was pretty cool
[01:27:14] Uh to be with you guys
[01:27:18] Yeah, I mean that's wild except like thinking like randomly you and I would be just like out in a building somewhere in ramadi
[01:27:26] And you're like telling him like hey, what do you got you're like telling me what's going on? I'm just
[01:27:30] thinking you're a rifleman
[01:27:32] Oh
[01:27:35] That's pretty awesome. Uh next thing endurance
[01:27:40] Endurance like courage has two distinct parts physical endurance means being able to function effectively when tired or in pain
[01:27:46] Mental endurance is the ability to think straight when fatigue distressed or in pain
[01:27:51] Demonstrated endurance brings
[01:27:53] Respect from subordinates lack of endurance fails not only to set a proper example for subordinates to follow
[01:27:58] But can also be mistaken for a lack of courage
[01:28:03] You can increase both mental and physical endurance by doing the following
[01:28:08] Avoiding excesses that lower both physical and mental stamina
[01:28:13] keeping physically fit
[01:28:15] By exercise and proper diet check learning to stand discomfort by undertaking hard physical tasks check
[01:28:21] Forcing yourself to study when you are tired and your mind is sluggish check
[01:28:25] Finishing every job regardless of obstacles. So there you go. Good to go. We support
[01:28:32] On set next one is unselfishness
[01:28:36] The unselfish leader is one who gives credit where credit is due
[01:28:39] Unselfishness means not taking advantage of a situation for personal gain at the expense of others
[01:28:44] No subordinate can respect an nco who takes credit for jobs well done and blames other when performance is poor
[01:28:50] check
[01:28:51] An unselfish marine nco will ensure subordinates needs come before personal needs check
[01:28:58] To develop your trade of unselfishness you should do the following see that subordinates have the best
[01:29:03] That can be obtained for them under the circumstances try to understand the problems
[01:29:09] military or personal of subordinates, um,
[01:29:12] David Belavia he told he told that story about um, his like
[01:29:16] Battalion sergeant major and they're like out in the street and his battalion sergeant major has an old
[01:29:22] m16 with iron sights on it
[01:29:24] And everyone else has got like the high speed stuff
[01:29:27] And he like that's what David Belavia remembered is that his command sergeant major who was killed in combat
[01:29:33] What he remembered about him is like he wouldn't take the good weapon
[01:29:38] you know
[01:29:38] that's
[01:29:39] That like I remember thinking about that after he was on the podcast and I was like
[01:29:43] That's what he remembered of all the things you remember you remember a bunch of other things
[01:29:47] But like think of how much that stands out. He like this guy
[01:29:50] He wouldn't take the good weapons from the troops even though he's the senior enlisted man in a freaking battalion
[01:29:56] It might even have been a regimental sergeant major
[01:29:59] but um, just awesome
[01:30:02] Put the comfort pleasures and recreation of your subordinates before your own
[01:30:05] In the field your marines eat before you do give credit to subordinates for jobs well done check
[01:30:11] Loyalty
[01:30:13] Loyalty is the quality of faithfulness to your country marine corps seniors and subordinates
[01:30:20] Demonstrated loyalty wins respects and confidence
[01:30:24] Loyalty means supporting the views and methods the unit employs, but doesn't mean becoming a yes man. Thank you. So there you go
[01:30:32] We get a little bit of you know
[01:30:34] Some of vietnam dude, you got a desert storm guy. Yeah, right? Yeah, yeah
[01:30:37] Yeah, yeah
[01:30:41] To develop loyalty you should do the following be quick to defend subordinates from abuse. Thank you
[01:30:48] Never give the slightest hint of disagreement with orders from seniors when giving instruction to subordinates
[01:30:54] Now I made a little note here
[01:30:57] Because there was a I don't know if you remember this the very first trait that got covered was integrity
[01:31:04] and it says
[01:31:05] Be accurate truthful in all statements
[01:31:09] Don't tell your superiors only what you think they want to hear tell it as it is but tactfully
[01:31:14] Practice absolute honesty at all times not only with yourself, but with others never shade the truth
[01:31:21] So now just fyi
[01:31:24] We're saying never give the slightest hint of disagreement with orders from seniors when giving instructions to subordinates
[01:31:29] So it's like we understand the caveat that we're throwing on there. Here's the problem. This is not a good plan
[01:31:35] It's not
[01:31:37] First of all because the team will see through it
[01:31:39] Because you're telling them to do something that doesn't make sense
[01:31:41] You know it doesn't make sense and if you know it doesn't make sense they're all gonna know it doesn't make sense
[01:31:45] Okay, maybe they all know but you got a platoon of 40 guys
[01:31:49] 12 of them know nine of them know nine of them are looking at you like you're a jackass and we don't believe you
[01:31:54] So how do we make this happen?
[01:31:56] It goes back to earlier when we're when we're talking and we develop a relationship with our boss so that we can say
[01:32:02] Hey boss, can you explain to me why we're doing this and if you have a good relationship with them and something doesn't make sense
[01:32:07] Either they can explain it to you so it does make sense or you can explain the ramifications that are going to occur
[01:32:12] And why this is a bad idea and if you still get the shut up and do what I told you you go down to the troops
[01:32:18] You don't lie to them you go down troops and say hey fellas. Look. I pushed back against the boss. Here's what we're doing
[01:32:23] Here's why we're doing it. We're gonna do the best of our ability and here's how we're gonna mitigate whatever problems might occur
[01:32:28] That's what you do
[01:32:33] I'm even thinking you know hack worth going on those patrols
[01:32:37] Like there's even in that the whole the whole spectrum that's inside there of like all right
[01:32:40] Jocko is the worst boss in the world. He's gonna order my guys to do something to get him killed
[01:32:45] I can I can fall on my sword which is like the classic
[01:32:49] It's like the um
[01:32:50] What's the word I'm like the most romantic like oh that look Dave's gonna fall on his sword
[01:32:54] I keep reminding people you know what happens when you fall on your sword you you fall on your sword
[01:32:57] You die you die that's not good and then Dave gets replaced with
[01:33:01] Echoes like whatever you say boss and in that case like all right. We're gonna go on that patrol
[01:33:07] These are dumb
[01:33:08] So what I'm gonna go outside the wire. I'm gonna set up this bim come on. Hey, we got no contact today
[01:33:12] So even you've been talking even the spectrum inside there
[01:33:14] But the thing of it is that you I think the key takeaway from that because the truth of the matter is most of the time
[01:33:20] You're not getting these orders gonna get your people killed. No that's such a rare like an extreme example
[01:33:24] Most of the time it's just like dumb
[01:33:27] Okay, nobody's gonna die. It's not gonna ruin the company, but it's dumb inside there
[01:33:33] If I come back and go hey, jog. Hey guys, this is the best idea ever boss is awesome and we're gonna go do this
[01:33:40] I'm gonna lose so much leadership capital leader which credibility, but I can't say hey listen
[01:33:44] I know this can be frustrating sometimes. I know sometimes it makes sense
[01:33:47] Here's what we're gonna do. Here's why let me explain it
[01:33:50] And if it's not gonna get anybody killed for any risk
[01:33:52] They'll still do it, but the reason they're doing it is not undying obedience to your leadership. It's actually that you are
[01:33:58] Being honest with them. You have integrity got integrity exactly
[01:34:01] And so even that that deck that definitions how they're even understanding that there's a balance even inside that concept
[01:34:08] I remember uh
[01:34:10] Getting told there's two two two good examples of this one of them is from um
[01:34:16] Bandit brothers when they send the recon across the river someone gets killed
[01:34:20] They come back the next night the colonel's like hey send someone send another recon tonight
[01:34:24] And he's like hey, I don't think that's a good idea. He's like shut up and do it
[01:34:25] He says okay, and they go sit in the basement of the towing and drink wine
[01:34:29] There was I heard this story when I was a new guy that you know in vietnam
[01:34:33] These guys got told hey, you're gonna go out and do a patrol in this area and they or set up an ambush in this area
[01:34:37] And they're like hey, that's a bad area. There's not gonna be anything and they're like no shut up and do it
[01:34:40] And he goes okay cool. Yep. Whatever the platoon commander says cool got it
[01:34:43] They went patrolled, you know 200 yards outside the gate
[01:34:46] Sat in the bushes for five hours patrol back in hey no no contact didn't say anything
[01:34:51] Yeah, I just said that associated with hackworth, but that I'm misplacing that it's the story
[01:34:55] It's that story that you told of like okay, I don't know why I connected to hackworth
[01:34:59] But it was that those patrols of like boss says to do this. I'm gonna go do this, but I'm actually not really doing it
[01:35:04] Yeah, that's that's exactly what it was it came from from the story you told right and that isn't like look that is
[01:35:10] Now we're now we're starting to develop some issues, right? Yep. Now we got some issues
[01:35:14] We got some issues because now we're
[01:35:17] We're giving false information up the chain of command
[01:35:20] So now we're in just as bad of a spot as good doing down. So that is not the right answer totally
[01:35:27] The right answer is to develop that relationship
[01:35:29] But what you're talking about you said use the term in extremist people gonna get killed
[01:35:33] So if we talk in an extremist people gonna get killed
[01:35:36] I'm not gonna get my guys killed if it doesn't make sense. Yeah, so but that like you said this is not like
[01:35:42] Oh another day in the military got ordered to do something that's gonna get about that doesn't I got asked this the other day
[01:35:47] I just guy pulled me aside after an event and he's like, you know, what are you doing?
[01:35:50] You get ordered to do something that is you know immoral and I was like, oh, don't do it
[01:35:55] He was oh, you just don't do it. I was like, no, you can't do things that are immoral unethical or illegal
[01:36:00] You can't do them as a matter of fact. I said it's your duty not to do them
[01:36:03] A general order of the century says you must obey all lawful orders
[01:36:07] It's if there's things that are unlawful you don't do them. In fact, you have to not do them
[01:36:11] And he was kind of looking at me surprised. He goes, well, how often did that happen? I go it never happened exactly
[01:36:15] Never actually zero times in 20 years and that's that's really the point
[01:36:20] Center to the point I was trying to make is we create this like
[01:36:23] We create some story that I'm being told by this awful evil boss is trying to get all my people killed
[01:36:27] And how do I handle that like?
[01:36:29] That never happened to me. Yeah, has it happened in history? Yeah, I guess it does and then inside that
[01:36:35] But from your perspective or from the point you're making from a leadership standpoint
[01:36:38] If if I've done all these other things right and I got a good relationship with my boss, jaco
[01:36:43] Hey, what are you? What are the chances again? Hey, Dave? I got this unethical thing. I want you to go
[01:36:46] It's not gonna happen. I gotta I gotta plan. I want you to go actually it's a bunch of people gonna get wounded to kill
[01:36:50] Go ahead and execute it. Totally. So those those scenarios and I have no reason why right?
[01:36:54] They don't and they don't just sit by themselves. That doesn't just happen
[01:36:58] Uh, so we want to avoid the idea that like
[01:37:00] Or what do you do in this case? Well, that never happened to me, but that didn't happen
[01:37:04] I never once had a relationship with my boss by which he said hey come here
[01:37:07] Half your people are gonna die. It serves no purpose, but I want you to go
[01:37:11] Come on man. Like we're not doing that. Hey, Dave, you know what? This is gonna cost the company a bunch of money
[01:37:16] It's gonna give us a bad reputation and we're probably gonna get some people to quit
[01:37:19] Yeah, I want you to go and execute this right and you're like cool. Got it
[01:37:23] Stuff doesn't happen. Um, but that's also why truth
[01:37:27] That's the leading trait here was integrity up and down the chain of commands. So we like that. Yes, um
[01:37:32] Practice doing every task the best your ability wholeheartedly support your commander's decisions
[01:37:37] How do you best support your commander's decisions by guiding your commander and pushing back against your commander when something doesn't make sense
[01:37:43] And getting on board with the little things that aren't gonna matter that much totally you tell me to do something
[01:37:47] I'm gonna do it man. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna get it done. I'm gonna kick ass at it
[01:37:52] If you tell me to do something that's totally stupid, I'm not gonna let you make that mistake
[01:37:56] That's how I'm gonna wholeheartedly support you by being smart and having good relationship with my boss
[01:38:00] Never discuss the personal problems of subordinates with others cool
[01:38:05] Stand for your country the Marine Corps your unit and your fellow Marines when they are unjustly accused check
[01:38:09] Never criticize seniors in the presence of subordinates
[01:38:15] Check with a caveat
[01:38:18] You know, like you said if you're doing something if you're being told to do something that doesn't make sense
[01:38:22] But it's not worth quote falling on your sword over. It's like, hey, listen. Here's why we're doing this
[01:38:28] I know it's not maybe the best way to get it done
[01:38:31] But in order to develop a better relationship with the boss and gain more caught with him
[01:38:34] We're gonna go ahead and execute this. We're gonna wear our freaking dress uniform tonight and everyone's like, you gotta be kidding me
[01:38:41] Yep, I wish I was kidding you, but I'm not yeah, we're gonna and you know what we're all gonna look so sharp that
[01:38:47] The boss is gonna know that we're the platoon that can get that's such a great example
[01:38:50] Because those are the it's like boss wants the paperwork done 12 hours ahead of the due date
[01:38:54] You know like oh come on like guys listen
[01:38:56] That's the those are the scenarios where your uniform you don't want to wear getting paperwork done
[01:39:02] Those are the far more realistic scenarios you had to come down and go. Hey guys
[01:39:05] I know it's a little bit frustrating
[01:39:07] But as opposed to boss is sending us on the suicide mission with no benefit. That's not that's not the scenario
[01:39:13] That's more likely. It's the one you used to describe like
[01:39:16] Guys, I know you don't want to do this. I know sometimes this comes out. It could be kind of frustrating
[01:39:20] But we're gonna do this and here's why and and if you got a good relationship to your people most of the time I'm gonna go
[01:39:26] Okay, fine. No worries, Dave. We got your back and they're gonna just get it done. It's not that big of a deal
[01:39:31] I just remembered at stoner's funeral in hawaii. There was some guy that was there
[01:39:37] I want to say was in hawaii who was stationed on the ship with stoner
[01:39:42] And the stoner was in charge of like I don't even know he's in charge of um like some department on the ship and
[01:39:49] they pulled into port and
[01:39:53] Stoner like gave the liberty brief. He's like, hey you guys, you know like liberty go go
[01:39:57] Don't get in trouble and they were all like, damn we don't have any duties or whatever
[01:40:01] And as they got this guy he said they were leaving the ship and they looked like
[01:40:05] Wherever on the ship and stoner was there like doing the duty that they all had to do like they had to clean something to do
[01:40:11] Someone and he was up there just like doing it by himself and I was like, I can dig the dude was so freaking
[01:40:16] And like pumped, you know, um, that's taking care of your people
[01:40:20] Uh, never criticize. Oh, yeah, never criticize your seniors and friends and support us. Yeah, check
[01:40:26] Do not discuss command problems outside the unit check be loyal to your seniors and subordinates. Check
[01:40:31] Support the lawful policies of senior officers. Whether you personally agree with them or not
[01:40:36] Loyalty is a two-way street
[01:40:39] What I would ask you to do
[01:40:41] Is not to support the lawful policies of senior officers whether you personally agree what I would ask you to do is understand them I
[01:40:49] Would ask you to understand why your boss wants you to wear a uniform on a Tuesday night
[01:40:54] I would want you to understand why your boss wants you to
[01:40:58] Turn the weapons it at a certain time before good ball, you know like understand and give them the benefit of that out
[01:41:04] That's that's that's a little bonus too because you could be super critical about everything and nothing makes it if you want to be
[01:41:09] Hypercritical literally nothing makes sense in the military. It's all freaking. It's all just dumb
[01:41:14] So if you want to go level 12
[01:41:16] Hypercritical and it's the same thing in any company you go
[01:41:19] We I could go to some company right now and start talking to the subordinate
[01:41:23] Teams start talking to the frontline personnel and we could get a list of stupid things that that company's doing and we could never stop
[01:41:30] writing them down
[01:41:31] So instead of looking for what's stupid try and understand why these things are happening
[01:41:36] And this is the last one judgment
[01:41:38] judgment is the ability
[01:41:41] To logically weigh facts and possible solutions on
[01:41:45] Which to base sound decisions and includes common sense when faced with a new problem or information you don't understand
[01:41:52] Seek advice before you attempt a solution. It isn't degrading to ask questions
[01:41:58] Note to self
[01:42:00] In leadership strategy and tactics one of the things that a leader supposed to do is to
[01:42:04] Ask questions
[01:42:06] It is embarrassing to arrive at a poor solution because of the lack of judgment to seek help
[01:42:12] To develop the trade of judgment. You should do the following practice making estimates of the situation
[01:42:17] That's something you can do as a leader get your get your team members
[01:42:20] Someone that you're trying to coach and mentor be like, hey echo. What do you think we should do right here?
[01:42:24] What do you think's going on and talk have them talk you through it and you're gonna get better
[01:42:29] You're gonna come up with a better solution anyways, but it finds a solution
[01:42:33] But if I have echo try and come up with a solution to estimate the solution or estimate the situation come over the solution
[01:42:38] Come up with a plan. I'm detached and I'll all of a sudden I get to see a different perspective that I didn't see before
[01:42:42] So there's a little
[01:42:44] A little bonus. There's a bonus to that
[01:42:48] Anticipate situations which required decisions to be prepared when the need arises cool
[01:42:53] Avoid making rash decisions. I like how they use the word avoid
[01:42:59] I would go strong like don't make rash decisions
[01:43:01] And I wouldn't use the you know, you don't want to say never but
[01:43:06] You need to go stronger than avoid
[01:43:09] like
[01:43:10] As often as possible avoid making rash decisions, right
[01:43:15] Maybe even a little stronger than that. We'd have to break out the thesaurus and get busy to figure out where we're going
[01:43:19] And the last one here approach problems with a common sense attitude, which may sound common sense
[01:43:27] But sometimes it's not
[01:43:29] um
[01:43:31] There you go
[01:43:33] Some more leadership. What do you got echo Charles?
[01:43:35] You kind of rewind into that maybe to few one few lines ago when you know, let them come up with a plan or whatever
[01:43:43] Just to give give them the the opportunity to exercise their capability. Whatever. Are you going in there with
[01:43:50] Knowing where you're not going to use their plan and they know that or are you like maybe you come up with a good plan
[01:43:56] If you come up with a plan that's like
[01:43:58] Viable, yeah, sounds good to me, right? Yeah
[01:44:00] If you come up if you come up with an idiot plan, we're not going to use it
[01:44:04] But what are the chances of you coming up with an idiot plan?
[01:44:08] If I said to you right now, you have no military experience if I was like, hey echo, we've got to attack this building
[01:44:15] Yeah, you'd probably come up with a plan that was almost usable
[01:44:19] Right, you'd be like, well, we should put some guys over here and maybe I give you a five minute class
[01:44:23] Then you if I give you a five minute class
[01:44:26] You could probably come up with a plan that we would execute
[01:44:28] Yeah, and I'd be like cool sounds close enough. Okay, so so it's like the primary primary
[01:44:33] Purpose for you doing that is to give them exercise, but completely open completely for for for that to be the jam
[01:44:40] And as you know, this is like how I roll anyways
[01:44:42] I mean this is like what I do all the time with everything. That's kind of why I was asking
[01:44:47] Yeah, I'm like, are you like in your mind saying
[01:44:50] But in case he does we'll go with it kind of a thing or because there's a difference between that and then really leaning on someone
[01:44:56] For the plan like, you know, if it's clear that Dave knows more than
[01:45:01] You or me or whatever about something you're like, hey, we better go to Dave for this plan
[01:45:05] You know, that's like leaning on him for it
[01:45:07] But sometimes it's like unnecessary, but the primary isn't you want to give them an exercise?
[01:45:11] So down the road or whatever they're going to be really good, but that's the primary purpose
[01:45:15] You seem saying I don't even know if it's the primary purpose because when if Dave's working for me and he's a platoon commander
[01:45:21] He's a project manager for me
[01:45:23] And I go, hey Dave, how do you want to execute this?
[01:45:29] Yes, he gets education
[01:45:31] Yes, he gets to learn
[01:45:33] But yes, he's probably gonna come up with a decent plan and as long as he comes up with a decent plan
[01:45:37] We're probably gonna execute that thing. Maybe we got to make a couple adjustments, but that's kind of what we're doing
[01:45:42] So it's a it's not even like hey if you're trying to change train someone right
[01:45:48] If I'm working with someone I'm gonna
[01:45:51] Try and let them come up with the plan
[01:45:53] It's gonna make me
[01:45:55] Better because when Dave comes up with a plan I
[01:45:58] Look, I have a plan in my head right? I've got something even if I look at a target for three seconds
[01:46:03] Or I look at a project for three seconds. I go. Yeah, I know what I do here as soon as I ask Dave
[01:46:06] I get a whole totally different perspective
[01:46:09] And so and and by the way
[01:46:11] Dave only sees what Dave sees
[01:46:14] So now when I say throw something out there
[01:46:17] He's like oh and it's like
[01:46:19] Like building my leadership capital because I'm listening to him, but I also have good ideas myself
[01:46:24] It's just a win win win win
[01:46:26] across the board
[01:46:30] So
[01:46:33] Fundamentals of marine leadership Dave Burke there you go you handed me this manual
[01:46:38] We got some good. We got some bad. We got some ugly. We only covered a little bit of it
[01:46:42] I don't know if we're gonna dig back into this thing, but uh the important thing is to
[01:46:46] Always dig see what you can find
[01:46:49] What do you got anything else? No, I think we said it. I mean inside there like I said
[01:46:55] I in every case I was thinking myself. I understand what you're saying, but so that's all good to go
[01:47:01] I actually I'm actually interested and see if there's like a new like an updated version
[01:47:05] You know the the 2017 version of this that has you know, 17 years or 16 years of combat experience inside there
[01:47:11] Um, for me, it's kind of cool though the 14 leadership traits those those
[01:47:18] You know, we called it JJ did type uncle. That's the acronym justice judgment decisiveness initiative
[01:47:24] You know all those letters that go on you know that you talked about
[01:47:28] That has stood this test of time and as you as you read what they meant. I'm like, that's right. That's right. That's right
[01:47:34] It also I think gets to the explaining this stuff is harder than it seems and we talk about leadership all the time we teach
[01:47:41] Some of the most rudimentary leadership behaviors in the world cover and move
[01:47:47] Communication and yet we know how hard it is to do them and so inside this you get this sense of even
[01:47:55] even for these folks
[01:47:57] Understanding it and explaining it and being able to do it or very different things. The stuff is hard
[01:48:02] Explaining it is hard
[01:48:04] learning it and understanding it is so much harder than it is to just say it and
[01:48:10] it was it's actually
[01:48:12] cool to hear as as you're talking through that my leadership radar my leadership here like wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong
[01:48:20] and to be able to pull out even some of the new ones inside there even like you said
[01:48:25] Don't say avoid being a tyrannical leader. Don't be a tyrannical leader
[01:48:30] and
[01:48:32] this was
[01:48:33] Had some fun with that, but this was cool to see that
[01:48:36] I had this sense of this of someone struggling to articulate a concept they understood
[01:48:41] but didn't know how to teach it and didn't have the the um
[01:48:45] The experience reservoir to go. Okay this concept now I can put meaning around this content concept based on my experience
[01:48:52] I would say that
[01:48:55] A little yes to that but also I would say that
[01:48:58] That
[01:49:00] Where I thought you were going with that is look you can read the word decisiveness
[01:49:04] And you can understand you can understand what that means and I can understand what that means
[01:49:10] But someone else apparently this guy
[01:49:14] Thinks that decisiveness means you need to understand all the facts
[01:49:17] So even these things that we understand a certain way
[01:49:21] They're interpretation of what decisiveness means is different and quite frankly in some of these cases not correct
[01:49:30] So they were able to take correct concepts
[01:49:33] And teach them in a way that are incorrect
[01:49:36] I don't think it had anything to do with not being able to
[01:49:41] Express it or articulate it. I think they actually didn't understand the thing
[01:49:46] Yeah, what that actually what that actually means. I mean when you're talking about um
[01:49:51] Some of those decentralized command that we're running kind of like flipping through to see some of those examples where I like wrote like no
[01:49:59] Like like what we just said never give the slightest hint of disagreement with orders
[01:50:05] when giving instructions to support it so
[01:50:07] We're we're we're not telling the truth to our troops
[01:50:11] loyalty
[01:50:13] I would focus on hey if you're loyal to your boss, you don't let them tell you to do something that may doesn't make any sense
[01:50:18] That's not being loyal totally the opposite. Yeah, yeah
[01:50:20] The last thing I want for loyalty from Dave Burke is I'm like hey Dave charge that machine gun nest
[01:50:25] With your squad elevated position
[01:50:28] Go the last thing I want from you to see you yes, sir in charge
[01:50:31] I want you to be loyal to you to your troops and loyal to me by saying hey boss. This is dumb
[01:50:38] We need to lay down cover fire and we'll maneuver around the outside. So
[01:50:40] So there's some there's some swings and some misses which is very interesting. I was thinking this I started thinking about this
[01:50:47] I'm like
[01:50:48] Is was this thing like the navy achievement medal of some like some like lieutenant colonel or major that was like
[01:50:55] oh
[01:50:56] We wrote the marine corps fundamental like and he just kind of that was his project. He got after it, you know
[01:51:01] Yeah, I wish the same with all the ones I wish you could have just been in the room
[01:51:06] Because there's shades there's little peaks of that guy nailed it whoever that guy was like you went through that one
[01:51:12] You're like nailed it. Yeah, you almost have the sense like that's someone who understands it and got his
[01:51:19] Fragments of this thing in this pub. Yep, where's the other guy who doesn't understand it got his fragments in and when you put them
[01:51:24] So I'm like yep nope
[01:51:26] You know it's what you were talking about being on paper versus being on target, right?
[01:51:30] And this this this has happened to us at echelon front where we get a leader we go and work with the leadership team
[01:51:38] and they take a principle
[01:51:40] And we check in with them, you know three weeks later
[01:51:42] We'll go back there and you can see this one person. They're on paper, but man, they're not hitting the mark
[01:51:49] and you know for them
[01:51:52] Extreme ownership meant I'm going to dictate everything that's happening here
[01:51:56] Or decentralized command meant I can go to the Bahamas for the next two weeks on vacation because I'm gonna let my team so
[01:52:03] They take it and interpret it the wrong way. Yeah, so this stuff
[01:52:09] There's there's probably you just like just like shooting like there's a chance
[01:52:13] You know I would take Dave and get you dialed in at 300 yards on your rifle
[01:52:17] You're gonna do pretty good if I take a group of a hundred people and do that
[01:52:20] How many have some people that cannot that aren't gonna be hitting paper? Yep
[01:52:23] And so that's what we have to watch out for and that's you know, what's interesting about working at echelon front like
[01:52:29] Because we do this all the time
[01:52:34] Like we we we know and we also have the ability to go up. Yep. This person's gonna be a little bit off target
[01:52:39] Hey, two clicks to the right one click down. We're gonna get you dialed in bullseye on this stuff
[01:52:44] And even that can be hard. There's some people there. They're they're they're praying spray. Some people have the vision of
[01:52:49] You know, finally jocco is gonna come to my company get everyone in line. It's like everyone. Yeah
[01:52:55] It's like no, it's not quite gonna go like that
[01:52:58] So when I read all these things
[01:53:03] Keeping an open mind about what you're reading what you're interpreting about what you're understanding
[01:53:09] Thinking that you know, even when someone presents me tomorrow afternoon. I'm working with a company and someone says
[01:53:15] Hey, jocco, I don't think cover and move works. I don't think to myself. Hey, shut up. You don't know what you're talking about
[01:53:22] I know I know I go talk to me about why not
[01:53:25] What is the situation?
[01:53:27] so keeping an open mind and
[01:53:30] Not thinking that you know everything
[01:53:32] is is extremely important
[01:53:35] and even
[01:53:37] Dictating right that's what I think one thing that sat a little bit wrong about this
[01:53:42] This this book for both of us is there is a lot of dictating the way things are with
[01:53:49] With no outs with no deviations and that's always problematic. It's always problematic to paint yourself into a corner
[01:53:57] It's always problematic to carve things into stone. Yeah
[01:54:00] There should be some things carved in stone very few the things that you carve in stone
[01:54:05] They should be very very few and even when you carve them into stone you should be able to move that rock around a little bit
[01:54:11] Yeah, I think that's an awesome metaphor and then the other word that that certainly triggered a response of me is the concept of control
[01:54:19] How this is about controlling like and we both that word are like wow that that
[01:54:23] But even conceptually like if you are if you in your mind think this this is a tool or technique to control people
[01:54:31] Your interpretation is going to be wrong because even the outcome that you're trying to achieve or even what leadership really is
[01:54:36] You've got and you talk about different perspectives if the perspective is this is a tool to control other people
[01:54:42] You've got this wrong. Yeah, and that was the other word that really hit me like man
[01:54:45] That's that is not what we're trying to achieve here if you're like throwing out
[01:54:49] Hey, if you got to be authoritarian deal, there's time to play. Hey, and you know what is there? Yeah, sure
[01:54:54] There's a time in a place
[01:54:55] There's a time that there's an emergency going on people don't know what's happening and you got to get up and be like
[01:55:00] Hey, everyone be quiet. We're moving over to this thing that happens
[01:55:03] but
[01:55:04] It shouldn't be happening a lot. So
[01:55:07] There you go leadership
[01:55:09] Lessons learned
[01:55:11] Thank you marine corps. You know marine corps
[01:55:15] You're my people. So I know you're with me now
[01:55:18] We just had to we had to dispel some stuff in this one
[01:55:22] Uh, appreciate it. What else what else we got echo people getting we're getting smarter. We are we're keeping an open mind
[01:55:28] We are we are trying to yes, so we're on the path. We're avoid keeping in a clothesline
[01:55:33] I'll tell you that definitely a good thing doing our best to avoid that. Uh, yes, so, you know, we're on this improvement path
[01:55:41] growth path
[01:55:43] And we need supplementation sometimes the jocobo supplements is we're gonna talk about first
[01:55:47] So additional protein in the form of a dessert short description. Yeah, same thing. It's called milk. You did it
[01:55:54] Yeah, it's its own thing. Yeah, it is
[01:55:56] Um, also energy drinks, but they're not regular energy drinks. They're good energy drinks boom called go
[01:56:04] That's gonna help us on our mental and physical path as well. Yeah creatine speaking of physical bringing it back
[01:56:10] Studied proven for improved performance results gains all that
[01:56:17] Oh, yeah
[01:56:18] That's true. Actually, you know, I there. I only had a small stint of creatine. Oh really? Yeah
[01:56:23] Yeah, it was I guess not so coincidentally the strongest I've ever been though in the weight room. See yeah
[01:56:30] Well, you go scientifically proven and bro scientifically proven. Yeah, I just never was that into supplements
[01:56:36] Yeah, and then yeah, maybe I should have been I don't know, but I got some creatine now though got called up now
[01:56:41] So we're back in the game. Yeah
[01:56:43] Um, also what else we got joint health keep your joints
[01:56:46] So you pretty much everything for every every supplement for pretty much any part of our path. We got you we got you
[01:56:53] Not to mention some new stuff coming out. I'm not gonna talk about that
[01:56:56] I'm not gonna pop the hype bubble on the new thing. Yeah, but there's some new keep the hype bubble some new
[01:57:04] There you go jockelfield.com get it at wow, wow vitamin shop

[01:57:29] Yeah, those monk rtds are like yeah, and you don't really understand like how good they are until you really have them
[01:57:36] Because they're only good on paper. Yeah, it's funny as we're using the expression on paper
[01:57:40] because you know on paper usually means like um
[01:57:44] It makes sense if you do the equation on paper, but in real life on paper
[01:57:49] Yeah, real life or in the field or whatever is different or whatever. So that's what I mean by this one, but
[01:57:54] So on paper, you're like, okay. Yeah, cool rtd. You don't got to mix it up or whatever
[01:57:58] But that element of it is a big deal when you really have them
[01:58:02] This bro. I'm just sucking them down. Yeah, it's a little too easy. Yeah, like you're like drinking like four of them
[01:58:07] Yeah in a day 120 sometimes

[01:58:59] I don't think so. Did you wear bell bottoms? No, I'm a man
[01:59:03] I
[01:59:05] Whatever brother this actually know when I wore bell bottoms in the navy in the navy
[01:59:09] Well, when I went to boot camp you had to wear these things called dungarees. They don't wear them anymore and they were
[01:59:14] They were bell bottoms
[01:59:16] They were
[01:59:17] But it was so lame. It was the lamest uniform ever
[01:59:21] Okay, so you weren't down with them. We call them dunger jams because they call them dungarees in the navy
[01:59:26] We call them dunger jams and buds and you were so happy to get out of those things, but you remember higgs
[01:59:31] Yeah, Jeff Higgs. So he got dropped from training
[01:59:35] And they took away his buds uniform
[01:59:38] And they put him back in his dunger jams and he was he wouldn't they want they dropped him and he was not leaving
[01:59:45] And he would just show up to pt
[01:59:47] Like the class would come out and he'd go with them and the instructors were like, dude
[01:59:50] You can't be out here and he would just like ignore them and then they would like escort him out of there
[01:59:55] And then the then they'd be like dude, you'd like you can't be here like you wait
[01:59:58] And he had his dunger jams on. Yep. That's what you're saying. Just like dude. I'm staying with the class whatever fools
[02:00:04] And they they dropped him and and then finally like he just stuck with it
[02:00:08] He just was not quitting and then finally they're like, all right, dude. This guy's a badass. We need to keep them
[02:00:14] You know
[02:00:18] Yeah, they would like
[02:00:19] They would get him away from the class and then they'd send him to you know, lock him in a room somewhere and he'd like break out and then he'd get back
[02:00:25] He was just freaking not quitting
[02:00:30] With the dunger jams. Yep. All right, so no bell, but okay, I understand
[02:00:34] That may be the first time I think I've ever like try to answer a question for jocos
[02:00:37] I'll look more like shaking my head. No, I usually just sit here and listen
[02:00:40] But he said bell bottoms on look at you. I'm like, I'm shaking my head. No before you say no
[02:00:44] I don't think I've ever done that before but that one just like I'm like, no
[02:00:48] That's not happening put this way. I was not surprised with your answer
[02:00:51] But sometimes you just never know. I'm seeing hey, honestly the the enlisted navy uniform
[02:00:57] Dressed uniform. Those are bell bottoms too. I think they are right when those be classified. I mean, yeah
[02:01:01] and I know what you're talking about and and
[02:01:03] That's not what he's like the cracker jack cracker jack uniform. You know what that is
[02:01:07] Like the dress blues for for a navy enlisted guy below the let rank of e
[02:01:12] Six e six and below like you you look like a cracker jack box, you know, you look like a like a stereotypical sailor
[02:01:19] Right. Yeah with the with the Dixie cup hat. They call it. Okay. Yeah. Is that the white?
[02:01:26] Yeah
[02:01:27] The flared out pants. Yeah the flare up kind of bell bottom is yeah bell bottom me for sure

[02:01:41] I don't know after nine. I don't know 79. Right?
[02:01:44] Oh, maybe maybe we have to inspect like old pictures and see if I ever had any role to
[02:01:49] It's part of my point because right now if I'm like, hey, jockel like hairstyles and all this
[02:01:54] Her styles hair is only to look good. So whatever I'm here to win. What was the speech you gave?

[02:06:23] Thank you for keeping us safe with your leadership here on the home front
[02:06:28] And everyone else out there one of the
[02:06:32] traits of a leader spelled out in this marine corps manual was courage
[02:06:38] And it talked about physical courage and it talked about moral courage
[02:06:41] And it talked about the mental control of fear and the book gave some recommendations
[02:06:47] on how to be courageous
[02:06:49] But the first recommendation that it gave
[02:06:53] Was place duty over your personal feelings or desires
[02:07:00] Place duty over your own personal feelings or desires
[02:07:03] And that's it and I think we can bring that down to a personal daily level
[02:07:11] Duty means do what you're supposed to do. That's how we build courage
[02:07:19] By ignoring how you feel
[02:07:21] And ignoring what you desire and by doing what you are supposed to do
[02:07:27] Which means we need
[02:07:29] to get out there
[02:07:31] and get after it
[02:07:33] And until next time this is dave and echo and jaco
[02:07:36] Out
