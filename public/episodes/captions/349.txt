[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 349 with Echo Charles and me,
[00:00:04] Jocko willing.
[00:00:05] Good evening Echo.
[00:00:06] Good evening.
[00:00:08] Powerful enemies must be out fought and out produced.
[00:00:14] It is not enough to just turn out a few more planes,
[00:00:18] a few more tanks, a few more guns, a few more ships
[00:00:21] that can be turned out by our enemies.
[00:00:24] We must out produce them overwhelmingly
[00:00:28] so that there can be no question of our ability
[00:00:31] to provide a crushing superiority of equipment
[00:00:35] in any theater of the world war.
[00:00:40] And that right there is what President Roosevelt
[00:00:44] told Congress and America less than a month
[00:00:48] after the attack on Pearl Harbor
[00:00:51] and what he talked about doing, we did.
[00:00:54] In the United States,
[00:00:56] America provided almost 70% of the military equipment
[00:01:03] for the allies in World War II.
[00:01:05] 297,000 aircraft, 193,000 artillery guns,
[00:01:11] 86,000 tanks, 2 million trucks,
[00:01:15] 2.6 million submachine guns, almost 12 million rifles.
[00:01:20] The US Navy grew from 700 ships to almost 7,000
[00:01:30] and that included 23 battleships
[00:01:33] and 151 aircraft carriers.
[00:01:39] And that crushing superiority of production
[00:01:45] and the brave men who brought those weapons
[00:01:48] to bear against the enemy overwhelmed the Nazis
[00:01:52] and the Imperial Japanese Army.
[00:01:54] And America's ability to create and produce,
[00:01:58] to design and manufacture,
[00:02:00] this has always been one of our strongest assets as a nation,
[00:02:08] our working class, the men and women of this country
[00:02:12] that actually do these things,
[00:02:14] that actually make these things happen, but that asset
[00:02:20] and that capability, it faded, it faded.
[00:02:27] And manufacturing went overseas,
[00:02:33] we shut down a lot of our mills,
[00:02:34] we shut down a lot of our factories,
[00:02:36] we abandoned our communities, we abandoned our workforce,
[00:02:40] we abandoned the American worker
[00:02:42] and our rivals around the world, they smiled
[00:02:51] and they eased that transition for us.
[00:02:54] They helped us down that path, they offered cheap labor,
[00:02:59] basically slave labor, they didn't care about worker safety,
[00:03:04] they didn't care about the environmental impact
[00:03:06] of what they were doing, but they were able to,
[00:03:08] they were able to win on price, but we paid the price.
[00:03:19] And we began to lose that incredibly valuable asset
[00:03:25] in our country, our ability to make things,
[00:03:27] our ability to build things,
[00:03:28] our ability to create and manufacture.
[00:03:34] And with the loss of that skill,
[00:03:36] with the loss of that asset,
[00:03:39] our strength in the world began to diminish,
[00:03:46] began to fade, but there's a new fire burning now
[00:03:54] and there's a slow burning revolution occurring.
[00:03:59] There are companies in America that have had enough of that,
[00:04:03] that are capturing the skills from the past,
[00:04:07] that are teaching the right people,
[00:04:09] that are restoring the machines and resurrecting the factories.
[00:04:15] There are people and companies that are rebuilding America
[00:04:19] into the strong, powerful and benevolent nation it once was.
[00:04:28] And I am honored to be part of some of those companies
[00:04:32] with my business partner, P. Roberts.
[00:04:35] And we have, we've invested everything we've got
[00:04:40] into OriginUSA and into JockoFuel
[00:04:43] and we are doing our best in this new war.
[00:04:51] An economic war, yes, it's an economic war.
[00:04:55] It's also a war of ideas and it's a war of ideology
[00:05:00] when you look at who we're up against.
[00:05:02] It's a war of skill, it's a war of production,
[00:05:07] it's a war of efficiency and it's a war of grit.
[00:05:13] It's a war between state control and self-determination,
[00:05:20] a war between subjugation and liberty,
[00:05:24] between slavery and freedom.
[00:05:28] That's what's at stake.
[00:05:34] And that's not just rhetoric, that's what's going on.
[00:05:37] And it's great to have Pete back here with us tonight
[00:05:42] to talk about the war that we're fighting right now
[00:05:45] on all fronts as we try to help rebuild America.
[00:05:51] Pete, what's happening, man?
[00:05:53] Badass, man, powerful.
[00:05:54] Thanks for having me back on.
[00:05:56] Pete Roberts, if you don't know who he is, podcast 93,
[00:05:59] podcast 141, podcast 194, podcast 297.
[00:06:03] That's, we joined forces in 2017.
[00:06:08] We recorded a podcast every year up here
[00:06:10] at the origin main immersion Jiu Jitsu camp,
[00:06:14] which we, there's a little gap in 2020.
[00:06:16] We got shut down.
[00:06:18] We weren't allowed to do Jiu Jitsu.
[00:06:19] We weren't allowed to do Jiu Jitsu.
[00:06:23] At least not in public.
[00:06:26] Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:26] We kept training.
[00:06:27] I'm sure you kept training too.
[00:06:30] So this has turned out to be an annual thing
[00:06:33] that we're doing and it's a good opportunity for us
[00:06:36] to let people know what's going on,
[00:06:38] share people some of the experiences that we've had
[00:06:40] and some of the lessons that we've learned
[00:06:42] because we're learning.
[00:06:43] We're learning a lot of lessons along the way
[00:06:45] and giving everyone an update as to what's happening
[00:06:48] so that they can see sort of the big picture
[00:06:50] of what's going on.
[00:06:51] So essentially we're talking about two companies.
[00:06:56] And really these two companies,
[00:07:00] I would say it's safe to say that they started
[00:07:04] as sort of a Siamese twins, right?
[00:07:06] Like they were connected and, you know,
[00:07:10] they had a lot, they shared a lot of blood.
[00:07:12] Maybe, yeah, maybe shared, you know,
[00:07:14] like they have three lungs total.
[00:07:16] One of the lungs was shared.
[00:07:18] You have two of the lungs.
[00:07:18] Yeah.
[00:07:19] It's like, so there's these shared things going on.
[00:07:23] One of the Jocofuel, obviously it's our supplement
[00:07:26] nutrition brand and the other one's Origin USA,
[00:07:28] which is our hard goods, clothing, accessories brand.
[00:07:34] We got fitness products in there too as well.
[00:07:36] So a bunch of stuff, but we got these two companies.
[00:07:38] So let's talk about where we're at with these,
[00:07:41] what's going on, some of the lessons we learned,
[00:07:44] some of the tuition payments that we've made.
[00:07:47] You know, do you have your MBA?
[00:07:49] I don't have shit, I'm a college dropout.
[00:07:51] Okay, so you don't have your MBA,
[00:07:52] I don't have my MBA.
[00:07:53] Echo, you have your MBA?
[00:07:54] No MBA.
[00:07:55] But you know what, we've learned some business lessons.
[00:07:58] Shouldn't they can't teach you in school?
[00:07:59] And they've cost way more than an MBA.
[00:08:01] Yes.
[00:08:03] So here we go.
[00:08:04] Let's start off talking a little bit about Jocofuel.
[00:08:06] Now what's interesting about this is last time
[00:08:09] we were together, or I guess during this time frame,
[00:08:12] I guess we didn't do it.
[00:08:13] We were getting to a point where we,
[00:08:19] as we had predicted, we were starting to need money.
[00:08:25] So we were starting to need money.
[00:08:28] This is a cash intensive business.
[00:08:31] Making food products, making supplements,
[00:08:34] being in retail, having to order millions
[00:08:38] and sometimes tens of millions of dollars worth of product
[00:08:43] and having to pay for that.
[00:08:45] And then having to hold on and hold your breath
[00:08:51] and pinch pennies until maybe 90, 120, 180 days,
[00:08:58] that money starts to come back in.
[00:08:59] We got, we did a lot of breath holding in this ramp up.
[00:09:04] And that's kind of the phase we were in last year
[00:09:06] around this time.
[00:09:07] We were in that every quarter, every month really,
[00:09:11] would be a breath hold, waiting for payment to come in.
[00:09:16] It's not a great feeling.
[00:09:17] Yeah, and behind the scenes, last year, during camp,
[00:09:20] when we were sitting around in private,
[00:09:21] talking about that cash to cash cycle
[00:09:24] and how we're starting to burn cash or feed the monster,
[00:09:29] the monster eats cash.
[00:09:30] I mean, knowing our goals for mass distribution
[00:09:34] and to try to get the things we're making
[00:09:36] in the hands of humanity, I mean, America for sure,
[00:09:40] that it was gonna be expensive growth.
[00:09:43] And definitely as committing to larger and larger orders,
[00:09:50] should there, something, there go wrong,
[00:09:52] knowing that you then have to dump, let's say, screw ups,
[00:09:58] which has a massive impact on cash flow also.
[00:10:02] We didn't have too many of those, had a couple.
[00:10:04] But yeah, man, the monster finally got fed, luckily,
[00:10:12] with the investment we took on with that great investor.
[00:10:14] But burning that cash for so long, as long as we could,
[00:10:21] and knowing that the right thing to do was to bring
[00:10:24] on a partner that could help us blow this thing up,
[00:10:28] was definitely challenging, knowing how we work together
[00:10:31] and how we make decisions and how we communicate
[00:10:35] and sticking somebody else in the mix that we don't know
[00:10:39] and trying to trust that process
[00:10:41] that they're gonna plug in easily.
[00:10:44] I think that for me was the most difficult thing,
[00:10:47] not even the other stuff, not having to dump flavor systems
[00:10:51] or overwrap cans because there's a can shortage,
[00:10:56] or try to pivot on where we're buying our ingredients from.
[00:11:01] It was really trying to plug somebody else
[00:11:04] into the equation.
[00:11:06] It could have gone terribly bad if it wasn't done right.
[00:11:09] So obviously, we had some decent offers
[00:11:14] from the different private equity firms and whatnot,
[00:11:16] but I honestly didn't think we were gonna find any
[00:11:19] at one point, I was kinda like, damn,
[00:11:22] this just isn't gonna happen and we're gonna have to
[00:11:24] either shrink and rethink, or I actually didn't know.
[00:11:29] Yeah, well, we had, I mean, I remember talking about
[00:11:32] Plan A, B, C, D, and that's what we had to do.
[00:11:39] That, the fact that you and I,
[00:11:42] sometimes, well, oftentimes we're making decisions in,
[00:11:45] I mean, multi-million dollar decisions in three texts
[00:11:49] or seven text messages, and it's always been like that.
[00:11:54] That is definitely a scary thing to mess up because,
[00:11:58] and look, I have the benefit of working with
[00:12:01] so many different companies at Eshalon Front
[00:12:03] that I see how hard it is for companies
[00:12:05] to make decisions sometimes when you have
[00:12:07] just a little bit different agendas going on
[00:12:10] and egos pop up and all of a sudden,
[00:12:13] simple decisions that should take 15 minutes,
[00:12:15] they end up taking 15 weeks, and I'm not kidding,
[00:12:18] like literally simple decisions that you can see
[00:12:21] the obvious answer for can take months instead of minutes.
[00:12:25] And we were operating in the minutes timeframe.
[00:12:30] And the other thing that was kind of cool
[00:12:33] was because we were living paycheck to paycheck for so long,
[00:12:36] man, we were lean.
[00:12:38] Super lean.
[00:12:39] Super lean, and it was just no fat.
[00:12:42] We were like a fighter that had cut weight
[00:12:45] and just barely made it, right?
[00:12:47] And we were doing that, it was like wrestling season.
[00:12:50] Every Wednesday and every Saturday, we were making weight.
[00:12:53] We were trying to see if we could shed a little bit of,
[00:12:55] we were sitting in the sauna trying to squeeze out
[00:12:57] a little bit of another extra eight ounces.
[00:13:01] And but what I liked about that is it made us good, right?
[00:13:05] It made us good.
[00:13:06] You ask someone that wrestled,
[00:13:08] hey, you tell them they gotta lose 15 pounds,
[00:13:10] they look at you like it's a joke.
[00:13:12] So we got rid of a lot of excess weight.
[00:13:15] We became very streamlined, but the problem was,
[00:13:19] and this is sort of the backup plan was,
[00:13:21] we were just gonna have to expand and grow a lot slower.
[00:13:25] That's what was gonna happen.
[00:13:26] So if we wouldn't have met good partners
[00:13:29] who's out of New York, great guys,
[00:13:31] if we wouldn't have met them, we would have done plan B
[00:13:35] and we would have made some adjustments
[00:13:37] and it would have been a slower growth.
[00:13:39] And the problem with that for me,
[00:13:42] is this is the same thing that I told the team
[00:13:44] at Jock of Fuel yesterday.
[00:13:45] At Escalon Front, we go and we go to the muster.
[00:13:49] And at the muster, we'll have scores of people,
[00:13:54] come up to every team member, to JP, to Lave, to me, to Dave,
[00:13:58] to everybody, and the individual come up and say,
[00:14:00] oh, you know, hey, I got my business back,
[00:14:03] we were about to go bankrupt,
[00:14:04] we recovered everything, we're hiring now,
[00:14:06] or oh, but I was about to get divorced
[00:14:08] and my wife and I are back together
[00:14:09] and I lost 58 pounds and just all these incredible stories
[00:14:14] that you hear.
[00:14:15] And it sounds great, but every muster debrief,
[00:14:20] what I tell the team is, hey, great job with this small
[00:14:25] number of people that we helped with these principles.
[00:14:27] And there are literally millions and millions of people
[00:14:31] that need these principles to help them in their life.
[00:14:35] And we're not reaching them right now,
[00:14:36] so we're not doing what we should be doing.
[00:14:37] And it's the same thing with Jock of Fuel.
[00:14:39] Right now, right now, as you and I are sitting here talking,
[00:14:42] there's a 22 year old kid that's drinking an energy drink
[00:14:46] that's absolutely horrible for him.
[00:14:48] That's what's happening.
[00:14:49] There's another seven year old kid
[00:14:51] that's drinking a chocolate milk that's filled with
[00:14:54] high fructose corn syrup and it's absolutely horrible for him.
[00:14:57] And his mom doesn't know,
[00:14:59] his mom doesn't know what's available,
[00:15:00] so that's the issue.
[00:15:02] So as in my own mind, I had the part of my brain saying,
[00:15:08] hey, hang on, we can hang on.
[00:15:10] And the other part of my brain is saying, who are we hurting?
[00:15:13] And the compromise is, okay, how about,
[00:15:16] and what we eventually did is a minority share
[00:15:19] we sold a minority share, brought in great partners
[00:15:22] that have some great brands.
[00:15:24] I mean, they've built and run some great companies,
[00:15:27] I mean, just outstanding.
[00:15:30] So that made it, that was nice.
[00:15:35] It was like at the end of wrestling season,
[00:15:37] where all of a sudden,
[00:15:38] we didn't have to cut weight every Wednesday and Saturday.
[00:15:41] Yes. Because we have some room.
[00:15:43] I definitely saw the relief on the finance team.
[00:15:45] Don got to sit back in his chair for about five minutes
[00:15:50] and go, ah, you know, I mean,
[00:15:52] because being that lean and running just in time inventory
[00:15:57] and at one point, Joe Moss,
[00:15:59] our chief revenue officer said,
[00:16:01] man, we're running this company
[00:16:03] with like nine people in three ball dudes.
[00:16:05] You know what I mean?
[00:16:07] Me, basically me, Joe and Brian there, whatever.
[00:16:10] And you're looking at our growth rate and our trajectory
[00:16:13] and it's like, damn, Joe, like that's funny, but it's right.
[00:16:17] And you know what?
[00:16:18] Running the business like you're on a desert island
[00:16:21] is gonna allow you, you know, you would think,
[00:16:25] now you're gonna be a good steward of that investment.
[00:16:28] You know, and I was talking to you about
[00:16:30] as far as like living into the brand,
[00:16:31] like after that investment came on,
[00:16:34] I felt like, I felt again that same kind of like,
[00:16:38] when I went back in the day,
[00:16:39] when remortgaging the house for origin,
[00:16:42] I felt the same thing like, man,
[00:16:44] you know, some of our family and friends
[00:16:46] invested in this with us alongside of us.
[00:16:48] All my family and friends.
[00:16:49] All your family and friends.
[00:16:50] Like, yeah, I mean, everyone I know.
[00:16:52] Yeah, hang on.
[00:16:53] That's a broad statement,
[00:16:54] but like a lot of people that are very close to me
[00:16:57] are in the game with us.
[00:16:58] And I think that's important that like,
[00:17:00] this new partner allowed us to bring our family and friends
[00:17:03] into my childhood friend.
[00:17:05] I've known since I was 12 years old,
[00:17:06] invested in this thing.
[00:17:07] You know what I mean?
[00:17:08] Man, I better be a good steward of this and like I said,
[00:17:13] live into it.
[00:17:15] You know what I mean?
[00:17:16] And you were like, what is live into it?
[00:17:18] Like, well, I'm gonna, I haven't been, you know what I mean?
[00:17:22] I like them cookies and that ice cream.
[00:17:25] But how well have you been quote living into it this week?
[00:17:31] Dude, I've seen you consume more cookies, brownies.
[00:17:37] What is going on, dude?
[00:17:38] We've been living into that jujitsu immersion.
[00:17:40] Poha that, you know, late night, cold cut combo snack.
[00:17:46] Just get in there, dude.
[00:17:48] But I mean, you know, like as far as understanding
[00:17:51] the psyche of the consumer, of the people out there,
[00:17:55] because I believe right now, and if you look at America,
[00:18:01] I think we're the strongest and healthiest we've ever been.
[00:18:04] And I think we're the most unhealthy
[00:18:07] and most out of shape.
[00:18:09] The term of America at large.
[00:18:10] The people of America.
[00:18:12] And it's probably a worldwide thing too,
[00:18:14] but we're, you're, there's some strong people.
[00:18:18] Strongest we've ever been.
[00:18:19] 100%.
[00:18:20] And healthiest we've ever been.
[00:18:21] And then the heaviest and the most unhealthy.
[00:18:25] And people dying of all sorts of shit.
[00:18:27] And there's this freaking gap, you know?
[00:18:30] And yeah, you can point the finger,
[00:18:32] but the finger goes in a lot of different directions.
[00:18:35] You gotta have a lot of finger pointing.
[00:18:37] The fact of the matter is,
[00:18:38] is we're trying to fill the void between the two.
[00:18:40] You know, and educate people in a different way.
[00:18:44] And, you know, and Jocko Fuel as a mission,
[00:18:47] as a movement, and the things we're doing,
[00:18:50] it's no different than the origin side.
[00:18:52] You know, origin built to believe,
[00:18:54] built to believe in the dream,
[00:18:55] built to believe in resurrection of America's factories
[00:18:59] and communities and the reclamation and the reshoring
[00:19:01] and the restoring of the communities.
[00:19:02] And Jocko Fuel built to be better.
[00:19:05] You know, it's the same damn thing.
[00:19:07] Everything you wear, everything you consume,
[00:19:09] like it's right there.
[00:19:13] You know what I mean?
[00:19:13] It's right there.
[00:19:14] But then how do you wedge that into this country
[00:19:19] which is not just divided,
[00:19:22] also from a health and physical perspective, it's divided.
[00:19:26] So there's this education process that's taking place.
[00:19:30] And honestly, taking on the investment
[00:19:32] is gonna allow us to do more of this education
[00:19:34] across the board.
[00:19:35] So that was the point I was getting at,
[00:19:38] was like looking at weighing between,
[00:19:39] okay, we can keep total control
[00:19:42] and be a little bit greedy.
[00:19:45] Right.
[00:19:46] And hang on, this is mine, or say, hey, listen,
[00:19:48] let's get this as many people as we can.
[00:19:50] So we made that adjustment.
[00:19:53] And so far, it's been awesome.
[00:19:55] It's been awesome to have more freedom of movement for us.
[00:19:57] It's been awesome to still be able to push forward
[00:20:00] in ways that we weren't pushing forward before
[00:20:03] and be able to execute on things that we would have had to.
[00:20:06] You know, plan B and plan C didn't have the same products
[00:20:10] coming out, we weren't able to tackle the same problems
[00:20:14] that we're gonna be able to tackle now.
[00:20:15] So that was awesome.
[00:20:19] As that's going on, meanwhile,
[00:20:22] we expanded outside the state of Maine,
[00:20:25] which I may have broke your heart initially
[00:20:28] because you're a Maina.
[00:20:29] I am a Maina, I'm actually a mass hole technically.
[00:20:33] My father-in-law, Joe, will never allow me to claim being
[00:20:36] a Maina. Oh, he doesn't let you claim, huh?
[00:20:37] No, I'm from Massachusetts, man.
[00:20:39] Even though I've been here since I was eight years old,
[00:20:42] never a Maina.
[00:20:43] And your kids can't, your kids can't,
[00:20:45] they think I'm a mass hole too.
[00:20:46] They can't anchor baby you up here?
[00:20:48] No, I wish.
[00:20:50] No, but yeah, I mean, you know, like as this is all going on,
[00:20:55] as we're going through the process of investment
[00:20:57] and having all these meetings and everything.
[00:20:59] And at the same time.
[00:21:00] That's one monster.
[00:21:01] Yeah, one monster.
[00:21:02] One monster, Jock with Fuel, is hungry.
[00:21:04] Very hungry.
[00:21:06] And like needs attention and food and money.
[00:21:10] Yes.
[00:21:11] That's all going on.
[00:21:12] And that's a huge, huge deal.
[00:21:14] But then on the other side, the other monster,
[00:21:16] the origin monster is also hungry.
[00:21:18] To your point earlier, these things are tangled
[00:21:20] like Siamese twins.
[00:21:22] And these monsters are both, they're growing
[00:21:24] and they both need to be fed.
[00:21:25] And like someone has to conduct surgery.
[00:21:28] Yeah.
[00:21:29] And just from another perspective,
[00:21:30] they're both in being tangled, in being connected,
[00:21:35] they're also mutually supporting.
[00:21:36] They need each other.
[00:21:37] They totally need each other.
[00:21:39] And especially, you know, a year ago, it was like,
[00:21:42] without one, there really wouldn't be the other.
[00:21:44] And without the other, there wouldn't really be the one.
[00:21:46] So you had this, the one is eating, you know,
[00:21:51] is eating big, taking big bites.
[00:21:52] So the other one, now all of a sudden you start hearing
[00:21:55] like the stomach of the origin monster starts to growl.
[00:21:59] Yeah.
[00:22:01] Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:02] And you know, we, I think in an effort to make sure
[00:22:06] we're doing things right, you know,
[00:22:08] we made our tuition payments on the origin side.
[00:22:10] We built the things that built America, Denim and Boots.
[00:22:15] We proved we could build them again.
[00:22:17] We proved we could find and reclaim the knowledge
[00:22:20] and make the product and do it in a way
[00:22:23] that it was profitable to.
[00:22:25] So we kind of have proved this out.
[00:22:27] And it's like, okay, it's time to go, you know?
[00:22:30] And if you're not growing, you're dying, you know?
[00:22:32] And that's one thing I think in business,
[00:22:35] like people, they get comfortable, they get complacent.
[00:22:38] Well, listen, if you're not, if you're not growing,
[00:22:39] you're dying because somebody smarter than you
[00:22:41] is behind you, you know?
[00:22:42] And with everything, there's a beginning,
[00:22:45] there's a middle, when there's an end
[00:22:47] and trying to extend that middle part, it's not a coast.
[00:22:50] It's not a flat road.
[00:22:51] It's not coasting.
[00:22:53] I was telling somebody the other day,
[00:22:55] you know, you get to the top of that hill
[00:22:56] when you're climbing, you're pedaling and pedaling
[00:22:59] and pedaling and you get to the top and you think,
[00:23:01] ah, I get to coast on the other side.
[00:23:02] The thing is you get to a plateau
[00:23:05] and then there's an incline on that plateau.
[00:23:07] You can't see over the horizon.
[00:23:09] And with Origin, we've been, you know,
[00:23:11] we've kind of been playing in the sandbox a little bit.
[00:23:15] I, addressing the team, you know, on the inside,
[00:23:19] you know, kind of in the trenches earlier this year was,
[00:23:23] this year, we start.
[00:23:27] I actually said to them, we haven't done anything yet.
[00:23:31] We're spread across 250,000 square feet
[00:23:34] in two states and 400 people and we haven't even started.
[00:23:39] Like this shit, like we've been,
[00:23:42] we've been a research and development company.
[00:23:45] Now it's time to go.
[00:23:46] Now it's time to truly rebuild the supply chains
[00:23:49] and build the products that we need and use and wear.
[00:23:53] So I kind of, you know, like cast that wide vision
[00:23:57] early in the year and even, even the constant touch point,
[00:24:02] I think still, you know, still people,
[00:24:07] it's almost like, I mean, you have kids, you know,
[00:24:11] when I, when I had my first child, Keegan, like Amanda,
[00:24:14] you know, she's pregnant.
[00:24:16] It's like, cool, you know, you're pregnant and whatever.
[00:24:18] And then, then he came out and I was like, holy shit.
[00:24:21] What am I going to do with this?
[00:24:24] You know what I mean?
[00:24:25] Like this is a, this is a real being.
[00:24:27] That's kind of how I feel like we're,
[00:24:29] we're ready to like go.
[00:24:31] Like there's like almost like a little bit of a rebirth,
[00:24:33] so to speak this year of what we're going to do
[00:24:36] as a company, as a mission, as a, as a movement.
[00:24:40] And I could see it.
[00:24:42] I know you could see it and I'm trying to explain it
[00:24:45] to the team, but they aren't, they aren't feeling it yet
[00:24:48] because it's all just words.
[00:24:51] But we just, just, I got to fill this out there.
[00:24:54] Like I'll go to talk to a gas oil company in North Dakota
[00:24:59] or I'll go talk to an energy company in Texas
[00:25:02] or we'll talk to a construction company in Illinois
[00:25:05] or just, just, and there'll be a bunch of people
[00:25:10] that will show up with the lab origin genes on,
[00:25:12] they'll have origin boots on.
[00:25:14] They're in the game.
[00:25:16] They're so supportive.
[00:25:17] And so I think that, I get to see that, right?
[00:25:21] I get to see people all over the country
[00:25:23] that are, that understand what we're doing
[00:25:26] and they're so supportive of it.
[00:25:28] And I probably didn't do a great job of, you know,
[00:25:30] I should be taking a picture every time that happens.
[00:25:32] I'm sending it to you like, hey, show everybody this picture.
[00:25:35] I mean, I've been to events where there's like 12 people
[00:25:37] come up and they're all wearing origin genes.
[00:25:39] Like how, how awesome is that?
[00:25:41] And you know, this will be in the middle of wherever,
[00:25:43] Oklahoma, it's, it's, it's awesome.
[00:25:45] So yeah, you can start to, you and I can sense
[00:25:48] all that happening and probably need to do a better job
[00:25:52] making sure everybody on the team knows that.
[00:25:54] Yeah, and in there, you know, it's interesting.
[00:25:56] I don't know how to look at this.
[00:25:58] They're in the trenches every day, like making the stuff,
[00:26:01] answering the phone calls, you know,
[00:26:03] doing the marketing and all that stuff.
[00:26:05] And we're gonna build 100,000 pairs of genes, right?
[00:26:08] Over the next 12 months.
[00:26:10] And I'm, and I'm down in Trion, Georgia,
[00:26:13] at mountain Vernon Mills, the oldest mill in America
[00:26:16] and the last mill that weaves denim
[00:26:18] and they weave our denim for us.
[00:26:21] And I'm committing to 2 million yards in three years.
[00:26:25] And I'm coming back and saying,
[00:26:26] hey, I just committed to every single yard of denim
[00:26:28] this mill can make.
[00:26:29] You know what I mean?
[00:26:31] They're like, oh, okay.
[00:26:33] Okay.
[00:26:34] This is like being in Vegas, man.
[00:26:36] And just taking your wallet and putting it on black.
[00:26:38] 100%.
[00:26:39] 100%.
[00:26:40] You know, so there's, there's like,
[00:26:42] how are we gonna fill the gap?
[00:26:44] How are we gonna go from point A to point B?
[00:26:46] And speaking of feeding the monsters,
[00:26:48] oh, we're gonna build 100,000 pairs of genes
[00:26:50] in three years, we're gonna build a million, you know?
[00:26:53] And on the jockel fuel side,
[00:26:54] oh, we're making 30,000 cases of this a month
[00:26:57] and we need to get to 200,000 in three years.
[00:26:59] You have these two, these two monsters
[00:27:01] that you actually know like the, what they're gonna eat.
[00:27:06] You know that, you know the, you use the baby.
[00:27:08] Consumption.
[00:27:09] The consumption rate.
[00:27:10] You know how much freaking milk
[00:27:11] it's gonna take to get these kids to be full grown.
[00:27:15] That's right.
[00:27:15] And so you need to plan for it.
[00:27:16] And you know, at some point,
[00:27:18] they're gonna be a 16 and a half year old boy
[00:27:21] and they're gonna have a voracious appetite.
[00:27:24] Exactly.
[00:27:25] And it's gonna be nuts.
[00:27:26] And we actually know that.
[00:27:27] We can plot it out.
[00:27:28] We can see it.
[00:27:30] And so that, so that's, as you look at that growth
[00:27:33] and the amount of effort it was gonna take
[00:27:36] or the amount of work that it was gonna take to get done,
[00:27:39] you knew that we were gonna reach our limit here in Maine.
[00:27:42] 100%.
[00:27:43] Yep.
[00:27:44] And just walking around the factory
[00:27:46] and just we have pivoted and pivoted and pivoted
[00:27:49] and pivoted and gotten leaner and leaner and leaner and leaner.
[00:27:53] I mean, and you gotta remember in that,
[00:27:54] in our first little, you know,
[00:27:56] our first big factory after we left the woods, right?
[00:28:01] Like when you came on board and we partnered up,
[00:28:04] we were still in the woods and we're like,
[00:28:06] we're gonna buy this big building like 20,000 square feet.
[00:28:12] Where we're at one point,
[00:28:14] Jocko Fuel literally was on pallets
[00:28:16] in between all the sewing machines.
[00:28:18] So just so people understand how these things were tangled.
[00:28:21] And so we moved into that building in 2017 July.
[00:28:26] And when we did that, we had 12 employees.
[00:28:29] Yeah, 12.
[00:28:30] 12 employees.
[00:28:31] I mean, it was cool.
[00:28:33] It was cool.
[00:28:34] And you walked around and it was like, okay, cool.
[00:28:36] We got like plenty of room to grow, right?
[00:28:37] Oh, we got plenty of room to grow.
[00:28:39] Not so much.
[00:28:40] Not so much.
[00:28:42] So, you know, there's a, you know,
[00:28:44] just walking around and thinking,
[00:28:47] this is not going to sustain us.
[00:28:51] And looking at the kind of stepping back out of the trenches,
[00:28:54] looking at the battlefield,
[00:28:55] going, how are we gonna go from, you know,
[00:28:58] point A to point B when it comes to knitwear,
[00:29:02] when it comes to hoodies,
[00:29:03] when it comes to T-shirts, when it comes to denim,
[00:29:05] when it comes to all the things we need to make,
[00:29:09] we're going to have to look elsewhere.
[00:29:12] We're going to have to look elsewhere
[00:29:13] closer to the supply chains,
[00:29:15] knowing that what we're really good at in Maine
[00:29:19] is building ultra durable goods like footwear
[00:29:21] and jujitsu giz.
[00:29:23] And that the cotton supply chain,
[00:29:25] the weaving and the dying is all more down
[00:29:29] in North Carolina, in Georgia, Louisiana,
[00:29:33] you know, South Carolina,
[00:29:35] is there opportunity down there?
[00:29:37] And we found some opportunity.
[00:29:40] So, we found a company that was going to cut and sew for us.
[00:29:48] And man, they were starting to work on some projects for us.
[00:29:52] And I remember just calling you and being like,
[00:29:54] bro, we got to try and buy this place,
[00:29:59] like walking into that for the first time
[00:30:01] and seeing it three times bigger than what we're doing
[00:30:04] and just cranking stuff out.
[00:30:06] I was like, oh man, God, like you don't know
[00:30:08] what you don't know, you know?
[00:30:10] And I actually say that to my kids, like, hey, you know,
[00:30:13] you don't know what you don't know
[00:30:16] and you can't control what you can't control,
[00:30:18] but you can respond, you can control the way you respond
[00:30:21] to things you can't control.
[00:30:23] Well, we can respond to the things we don't know,
[00:30:25] we can control the way we respond to it, you know,
[00:30:28] and try not to have an entrepreneurial seizure
[00:30:31] at the same time, which, you know,
[00:30:34] we had some opportunities to have, I think.
[00:30:37] But we bought two factories.
[00:30:42] Let's talk through the first one.
[00:30:44] Yeah. Right.
[00:30:45] So, it's 60,000 square feet.
[00:30:48] You roll down there.
[00:30:49] There's not a for sale sign on it.
[00:30:51] No, it's not for sale.
[00:30:52] You know what I'm saying?
[00:30:53] Like, this isn't like you go on a used car lot.
[00:30:55] There's a used, you know, cut and sew factory for sale
[00:30:58] and you, hey, hey, how much is this?
[00:31:00] And you know, that's not how it worked.
[00:31:01] No, and these, and like they barely have a website.
[00:31:04] I mean, you know, there's like all these old,
[00:31:06] little old factories spread across America
[00:31:08] that are still there that have been surviving.
[00:31:12] They have not thrived.
[00:31:13] They're not thriving factories.
[00:31:16] They've been surviving for the last 25 years
[00:31:19] out of a sheer like force of will, right?
[00:31:22] Whether a commitment to the people
[00:31:24] who have been working there for 25, 30 years,
[00:31:26] you know, or not knowing enough to shut it down
[00:31:30] or being too, I don't know what the word is on.
[00:31:35] Stubborn. Stubborn.
[00:31:36] Yeah, to shut it down.
[00:31:38] So, luckily I was able to go.
[00:31:41] Patriotic, to patriotic to shut it down.
[00:31:43] I think patriotic is a better word.
[00:31:44] Yeah.
[00:31:46] I mean, yeah.
[00:31:48] So, went in and met with this old boy Ted,
[00:31:51] had some, was it going through some health problems,
[00:31:54] kind of sold them on the vision.
[00:31:55] Of course, you know, they are looking at a Yankee.
[00:32:02] This Yankee coming down.
[00:32:05] And there's still some of that there.
[00:32:07] You know what I mean?
[00:32:08] Like even Jason has said to me,
[00:32:10] you know, y'all rich Yankees coming down here.
[00:32:12] Bro, you kidding me?
[00:32:14] When we started this company,
[00:32:15] we didn't have two nickels to rub together
[00:32:16] and a bucket to piss in, bro.
[00:32:18] Like go on to YouTube and watch how we built this thing.
[00:32:21] So, but it's still like these Yankees coming down
[00:32:24] and whatever.
[00:32:25] So, you know, went down there, met with Ted,
[00:32:29] told him what we'd like to do to carry on his vision
[00:32:33] and plan for the company.
[00:32:34] Obviously, he had a great operator down there
[00:32:36] and Jason Gaddy, great operator who's been doing this thing.
[00:32:39] And he's really the one that's been sustaining
[00:32:42] this organization for a long time.
[00:32:45] You know, 120 employees, whatever it is,
[00:32:47] and just cutting and sewing, just ripping stuff out,
[00:32:50] making stuff for some pretty substantial brands too.
[00:32:55] But, you know, it's one of those situations where,
[00:32:58] like, okay, this guy's kind of like a lot of talk.
[00:33:03] They're thinking you're a lot of talk is what I'm saying.
[00:33:05] Yeah, I think so.
[00:33:06] And it's tough.
[00:33:07] You've got this, you've got these people
[00:33:10] who have been running this business for 40, 50 years.
[00:33:15] They've owned it for 40, 50 years.
[00:33:18] They do things a certain way.
[00:33:20] They have a certain culture.
[00:33:21] There's a certain pace.
[00:33:22] There's a certain vibe.
[00:33:24] You know, and just somebody coming in
[00:33:27] that could potentially disrupt that is scary.
[00:33:30] Scary, you know.
[00:33:31] I mean, you're ultimately, people are innately afraid
[00:33:35] of the unknown.
[00:33:36] You know, it's also what also drives some people.
[00:33:38] But I asked him and convinced him,
[00:33:44] and not just him, I flew him up to Maine
[00:33:48] and showed him our little factory
[00:33:51] and showed him what we were doing
[00:33:53] and introduced him to the people,
[00:33:55] introduced him to Amanda,
[00:33:57] obviously turned him onto Jaco.
[00:33:59] Like, you know, of course, they know who you are anyways.
[00:34:02] So just kind of made that connection.
[00:34:04] That always helps.
[00:34:05] It's always like you've got plant,
[00:34:06] you've got like the, Dedeco says this,
[00:34:09] like when somebody comes to his school, right?
[00:34:12] Dedeco, one of my business partners,
[00:34:15] also my Jiu-Jitsu instructor.
[00:34:17] He's got a school down in Massachusetts in Waymouth.
[00:34:19] And when people come in, they like,
[00:34:22] oh, I want to start Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:34:23] And they were like, okay, cool.
[00:34:25] Oh, oh, Origin Gees.
[00:34:27] Oh, cool.
[00:34:28] I think I've heard of this company, Origin.
[00:34:30] It's like, yeah, man, yeah, Origin, you know, Origin.
[00:34:32] And then they're like, oh, wait, Jaco?
[00:34:36] And he's like, yeah, yeah.
[00:34:38] You know, he's also my business partner,
[00:34:40] my friend or whatever.
[00:34:41] And then they sign up right away.
[00:34:43] So it's the ringer, right?
[00:34:45] Like Jaco's the ringer.
[00:34:46] And every negotiation I just pull,
[00:34:48] I pull Jaco's name and it always, it always helps.
[00:34:51] So, you know, we flew him up to Maine.
[00:34:55] We flew up, you know who else we flew up?
[00:34:59] The head stitcher and the mechanic.
[00:35:02] Yeah.
[00:35:03] And that's one of those things.
[00:35:04] This is the Hearts and Minds campaign.
[00:35:05] Hearts and Minds, man.
[00:35:06] And getting to build relationships with people.
[00:35:08] And getting them to understand what we understand.
[00:35:12] Yes.
[00:35:13] I want the mechanic to meet our team and to watch them sell.
[00:35:17] That's what I want him to do.
[00:35:19] So he can say to Ted, the owner,
[00:35:22] hey, these guys are for real.
[00:35:23] They know what they're doing.
[00:35:24] I get what they're doing.
[00:35:26] Their head stitcher, I want her to watch the way we sewed.
[00:35:29] The way the hands moved so that she could feel confident
[00:35:33] in the same thing.
[00:35:34] That, you know, we're, we are who they are.
[00:35:38] We're not just Yankees.
[00:35:39] We are people who are trying to rebuild the middle class
[00:35:43] who are retraining and bringing this thing back.
[00:35:47] The same thing they've been doing for 30, 40 years.
[00:35:50] Luckily, they agreed to it and we made that shit happen.
[00:35:54] Was there a turning point that you saw?
[00:35:56] Was there a moment or was it a gradual swaying
[00:36:01] of the mindset?
[00:36:03] Well, there was a tricky situation there, right?
[00:36:05] He had a couple other partners.
[00:36:08] And they had a kind of an aggressive ask initially.
[00:36:18] You know, like you said earlier,
[00:36:20] I don't have my business degree.
[00:36:23] I try to understand people.
[00:36:26] I'm pretty transparent in negotiation.
[00:36:28] Like I wear my heart on my sleeve.
[00:36:31] I'm not hiding anything.
[00:36:33] And I explained to him in their first ask,
[00:36:35] I was like, yeah, it's just not, we're just not there.
[00:36:38] Like we're just not there.
[00:36:39] Like here's the value of what we're gonna do.
[00:36:41] Cause we're not gonna buy this business
[00:36:44] as a business entity and keep like just running
[00:36:47] the same way with the same accounts.
[00:36:49] We're gonna buy this as an extension of Origin.
[00:36:52] That it's gonna be a, it's gonna be a production facility
[00:36:55] ultimately for Origin.
[00:36:56] So the revenue doesn't really matter.
[00:36:59] What's important is you have 120 people
[00:37:03] who know how to make badass shit, badass durable shit.
[00:37:06] And you have the machines to do so.
[00:37:08] So the value is in the people cause you can buy machines.
[00:37:11] So you're buying people.
[00:37:13] You're buying a skill set.
[00:37:14] You're buying a capability.
[00:37:16] And to try to, to try to ramp up 120 people
[00:37:20] and turn that on, we've already done it.
[00:37:22] It took, it took freaking a decade to do the same thing.
[00:37:27] We don't have a decade.
[00:37:28] So we got to buy capacity.
[00:37:30] So we're buying capacity.
[00:37:30] I explained that to him, unpacked that for him.
[00:37:33] And ultimately we came to agreement and, you know,
[00:37:37] when you, when, when you talk about like putting money
[00:37:39] where your mouth is like me, you and Deco stroke to check
[00:37:42] and bought that place.
[00:37:43] Like that's like, we're talking about where reinvesting
[00:37:46] in America's communities.
[00:37:49] That wasn't a bank loan on that one.
[00:37:51] We wrote a check.
[00:37:52] And I think that that was also meaningful to them knowing,
[00:37:57] yeah, we got to go finance this thing.
[00:37:59] Like we're not a hedge fund coming in.
[00:38:01] You know, we're not corporate raiders coming in.
[00:38:03] You know, we're, we're actually investing in this personally.
[00:38:06] Our families are investing in what your family has built.
[00:38:10] Pushed them over, got the deal done.
[00:38:13] And, you know, we're high fiving.
[00:38:16] We just added 120 people who know how to build bad ass shit,
[00:38:19] but it still wasn't enough.
[00:38:21] Yeah.
[00:38:22] And in the meantime, you know, we kind of breezed through the,
[00:38:25] the getting the partnership with good partners.
[00:38:31] One thing that was interesting about that was
[00:38:35] a lot of the stuff that I think would make a lot of companies
[00:38:39] really sweat and have to work.
[00:38:40] Like for instance, you know, our financials, right?
[00:38:44] So Don, our CFO, he's been here.
[00:38:47] And he, we were so dialed in, you know,
[00:38:51] despite all the overwork that he had done, you know,
[00:38:55] by himself much of the time, a lot of times.
[00:38:58] And look, luckily for me on the Eshalon front side,
[00:39:01] I'm, I'm party to a lot of these deals.
[00:39:04] You know, I see a lot of PEs come in.
[00:39:07] I watch these deals happen.
[00:39:08] I'm part of these deals sometimes.
[00:39:10] So I've seen a lot of this and it was awesome
[00:39:13] because sometimes, you know, you start asking
[00:39:16] when they start doing the financial due due diligence,
[00:39:19] you know, it's, it's like opening up a can of worms
[00:39:21] and mayhem's coming out and it gets crazy.
[00:39:24] And it was awesome to,
[00:39:26] and I remember you and I having this conversation, you know,
[00:39:27] like, hey, you know, I said,
[00:39:29] what are we looking like from the financial side?
[00:39:31] Is there a role in this due diligence?
[00:39:32] How long do you think it's gonna take?
[00:39:33] And you're like, hey, man, you know the deal.
[00:39:34] Like we, it's not gonna take long.
[00:39:36] And there's, it's all just good to go.
[00:39:38] And so I thought that that was pretty awesome,
[00:39:42] especially considering such a small team of one
[00:39:46] much of the time, you know, of just Don being that squared
[00:39:50] way and, and he had done a lot to prepare us for that.
[00:39:56] So that was, that was pretty awesome.
[00:39:59] And finding those guys, you know,
[00:40:03] I'd say that if people aren't aligned,
[00:40:06] though the one, the one time that you're gonna have a failure
[00:40:08] is if we aren't aligned, if two people aren't aligned
[00:40:11] or if two teams aren't aligned, you're gonna have,
[00:40:13] you're gonna ultimately have failure.
[00:40:14] Cause you can't be going to two different places.
[00:40:18] You have to be going to the same place.
[00:40:20] If you can't break the laws of physics
[00:40:22] and go to two different places,
[00:40:23] you can't rip bodies apart, it doesn't work.
[00:40:25] And so luckily with good partners, you know,
[00:40:28] they had, they had built Supreme,
[00:40:32] they'd built Skullcandy, they got some newer companies.
[00:40:36] Yeah, Dave, they got Hook, the H UK Hook performance
[00:40:40] fishing like really great companies that are cool.
[00:40:44] And so they had experience with this stuff.
[00:40:46] And they were able to address things
[00:40:48] with us and talk about where we wanted to go.
[00:40:50] And what, you know, here's,
[00:40:52] here's something that was tricky.
[00:40:55] I was tricky because I don't like to lock things in
[00:40:59] cause I don't know what the future holds.
[00:41:01] I'd give this advice all the time,
[00:41:02] hey, you don't know what the future is gonna hold.
[00:41:03] So why are you locking in this or that?
[00:41:05] And so the way we set things up
[00:41:08] and the way they worked with us was like,
[00:41:10] oh, we have all kinds of options.
[00:41:12] We have all kinds of directions to go into.
[00:41:13] There's no doors closed.
[00:41:15] So that was great.
[00:41:16] How flexible they were.
[00:41:17] They were patient as hell.
[00:41:18] Yeah, they were patient.
[00:41:19] They were patient as hell.
[00:41:20] Bro, at some point, sometimes like I,
[00:41:22] my ass was stuck to my couch, you know,
[00:41:25] and I would be like on the phone, on the phone,
[00:41:27] on the phone, on the phone, like till midnight.
[00:41:29] It was, honestly, it was like a,
[00:41:34] this kind of, this, I don't know the word for it,
[00:41:38] this constant alignment.
[00:41:41] Constant alignment and having the right,
[00:41:44] like the right words, you know what I mean?
[00:41:46] And sometimes those words were tricky to,
[00:41:50] yeah, tricky, tricky.
[00:41:52] Here's something else that was cool.
[00:41:53] And it's a good, this is a good,
[00:41:55] this is a good lesson learned for anybody that's out there.
[00:41:59] Lawyers talking to each other.
[00:42:00] Suck.
[00:42:01] Is different than two people talking to each other.
[00:42:03] Yes.
[00:42:04] So I remember we were, you know,
[00:42:07] we'd hit a little bit of a, let's say a little,
[00:42:11] a little hesitation, right?
[00:42:13] I was a little bit hesitant.
[00:42:15] It sounded like they,
[00:42:16] and so my lawyers are telling me that they're saying this
[00:42:19] and their lawyers are telling their crew
[00:42:21] that I'm saying this.
[00:42:22] And finally, I'm like, dude, give me Dave's number.
[00:42:26] And like, we just got on the phone
[00:42:28] and I'm like, hey, this is what I'm worried about.
[00:42:29] And he goes, yeah, we can handle that.
[00:42:30] That's no factor.
[00:42:31] I don't want it, you know, that doesn't make a difference.
[00:42:33] Okay, cool, great.
[00:42:34] Write it up like this.
[00:42:35] He's like, cool, I got it.
[00:42:36] He said, hey, but Jocko, you gotta give me this over here.
[00:42:38] And I'm like, oh yeah, that totally makes sense.
[00:42:40] I don't, you know, you're not gonna,
[00:42:41] you're not gonna give us money
[00:42:43] if you don't have this type of thing.
[00:42:45] So once he and I talked person to person, man to man,
[00:42:49] and just, oh yeah, hey man, okay, cool.
[00:42:53] From there, it was like everything was fine.
[00:42:55] But there was, getting to that-
[00:42:57] That whole time though, that monster kept eating.
[00:42:59] Oh, it kept eating, dude.
[00:43:00] It was eating everything in sight.
[00:43:03] And you know, I, you know, you were sweating.
[00:43:06] Yeah, oh yeah, I was definitely sweating.
[00:43:08] You were sweating.
[00:43:08] And you'd talk to me like, bro, you're trying to like,
[00:43:13] talk to both sets of lawyers.
[00:43:15] And I'm like, bro, let me talk to Dave.
[00:43:16] Let's get this thing.
[00:43:17] And so luckily, you know, when you talk and you're aligned,
[00:43:24] then it's easy.
[00:43:24] And look, look, hey, this is another thing I remember.
[00:43:26] When you, when someone else is,
[00:43:27] when the opposing lawyer is looking out for them
[00:43:31] and your lawyer's looking out for you,
[00:43:33] they're not, they're not trying to go to the same place.
[00:43:35] No.
[00:43:36] They're trying to go to two different places.
[00:43:37] So they're gonna have a hard time.
[00:43:39] So you have to have sometimes conversations.
[00:43:42] And those conversations need to be backed up in writing.
[00:43:43] Of course, that's why.
[00:43:44] So you can then debrief the lawyers
[00:43:46] and the lawyers understand where you need to be.
[00:43:49] And that both sides have agreed.
[00:43:51] So that's something to remember.
[00:43:54] And here's another, you know,
[00:43:57] you and I never freaking had lawyers in between us.
[00:44:00] You know what I mean?
[00:44:01] No, we didn't.
[00:44:02] And the other funny thing I was telling people
[00:44:03] to say the other day is we never had,
[00:44:05] we were on a handshake for years, on a handshake.
[00:44:10] Millions and millions of dollars worth of business.
[00:44:14] Tens of millions of dollars.
[00:44:14] Tens of millions of dollars worth of business
[00:44:16] on a handshake.
[00:44:17] On a handshake.
[00:44:19] That's legit.
[00:44:20] Which is freaking awesome.
[00:44:21] Like Old School, I hope people can learn from that.
[00:44:23] And by the way, the only reason we eventually were like,
[00:44:26] okay, we need to go to paper on this stuff
[00:44:28] is because the banks and the lawyers were like,
[00:44:30] hey, guys.
[00:44:32] This thing's too big.
[00:44:33] This doesn't work.
[00:44:34] You can't have a handshake.
[00:44:35] Like if one of you dies, if one of you dies,
[00:44:38] this is a freaking disaster for all involved.
[00:44:41] And we're like, all right, fine.
[00:44:43] So we did it.
[00:44:44] But that was great.
[00:44:48] I was definitely like sweating it.
[00:44:51] And I'll tell you what, I gotta give Kip props on it
[00:44:53] because he kept telling me, Pete,
[00:44:56] you gotta understand something.
[00:44:58] All big fish are lost at the boat.
[00:45:02] You can reel and reel and reel and reel and reel
[00:45:05] and you go to grab that gill and pull that hook
[00:45:08] and you lose it.
[00:45:09] You know what I mean?
[00:45:10] Like you get it right to the boat
[00:45:11] and it flaps its tail and rips off.
[00:45:14] And we were at tail flapping kind of scenario at that point.
[00:45:18] And I'm trying to hang onto the freaking gill.
[00:45:21] You know what I mean?
[00:45:22] Like trying to grab the club to kill this thing.
[00:45:26] But it was ultimately, I think that they were
[00:45:32] definitely not only the right partner,
[00:45:34] but the patient partner we need.
[00:45:36] You know, that was a nice, let's say,
[00:45:42] it proved to me as they were waiting.
[00:45:44] You know, they're like, okay.
[00:45:47] They didn't freak out.
[00:45:48] They didn't get crazy.
[00:45:50] They were like, oh, they were like,
[00:45:51] oh, it's gonna take some time to get this thing worked out.
[00:45:54] You know, it's like, oh, she doesn't wanna marry me right now.
[00:45:58] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:45:58] No, it's like she wants to wait another year.
[00:46:00] And most private equity firms would not have done that.
[00:46:03] Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:03] So they were super cool and proved
[00:46:05] the type of people that they were through their actions,
[00:46:08] which was legit.
[00:46:10] And so that worked out great and has been great.
[00:46:16] In the meantime, right?
[00:46:18] We get, how long was it?
[00:46:22] Once we had the factory in North Carolina,
[00:46:24] the first factory in North Carolina.
[00:46:25] October.
[00:46:26] Factory one, we get that in October.
[00:46:27] So just after we recorded the last podcast,
[00:46:29] we closed on that first.
[00:46:30] We closed on it.
[00:46:31] So we're stoked.
[00:46:33] How long did the Stoke last before you started,
[00:46:36] you started to hear hunger growls from the monster again?
[00:46:39] One month.
[00:46:40] It was one month?
[00:46:41] Yeah, because we launched November.
[00:46:44] We launched our Black Friday.
[00:46:46] We do that like one deal a year.
[00:46:48] And bro, we sold like 10,000 pairs of jeans.
[00:46:53] We had to close it off and like,
[00:46:56] I don't know, a thousand, two thousand pairs of boots.
[00:46:57] And I'm looking at it.
[00:46:58] I remember you texting me like, we're shutting it down.
[00:47:02] And that's when I was like, okay, that always sucks, bro.
[00:47:07] Cause what that means is someone out there
[00:47:09] is gonna have to buy a pair of jeans
[00:47:11] that are made in another country.
[00:47:14] And that's horrible.
[00:47:15] It's horrible for America.
[00:47:17] It's horrible for our economy.
[00:47:18] It's horrible for our community.
[00:47:19] It's horrible for the person that has to wear
[00:47:20] substandard jeans on their body.
[00:47:23] And yet, I remember, hey, we have to shut this down
[00:47:29] right now and I'm thinking, damn.
[00:47:31] The immediate pivot was, I remember sitting down
[00:47:35] the day, the next business day after Black Friday
[00:47:38] with the team and saying, what are we gonna do?
[00:47:41] How are we gonna pivot?
[00:47:42] And we got Jason on the phone,
[00:47:44] our new partner down in North Carolina,
[00:47:46] running all of North Carolina operations.
[00:47:49] Then I said, hey bro, I think we can make jeans there.
[00:47:54] Remember this?
[00:47:55] Yeah.
[00:47:55] And I'm like, I think we can,
[00:47:59] but these machines are completely different,
[00:48:01] fouling machines.
[00:48:03] He's like, yeah, we can get it done.
[00:48:05] We can get it done.
[00:48:06] And immediately, and I think that's the great thing
[00:48:09] with obviously owning your supply chain.
[00:48:13] I like to call it the Origin Factory Blockchain.
[00:48:16] I use the word blockchain because people understand
[00:48:19] what a blockchain is these days.
[00:48:21] Well, the Origin Factory Blockchain is a blockchain
[00:48:24] of manufacturing and transparency
[00:48:26] where you can trust where everything comes from.
[00:48:29] You know that cotton's come from Texas.
[00:48:30] You know that thing's woven in Triangle Georgia.
[00:48:32] You know it's getting cotton sown in North Carolina
[00:48:34] in Maine and it's a blockchain of manufacturing,
[00:48:37] which is really powerful.
[00:48:39] And it's actually core to who we are
[00:48:41] and core to our story,
[00:48:41] because we got nothing to hide.
[00:48:43] We ain't cutting out tags, right?
[00:48:45] We're making the shit from scratch.
[00:48:48] And we actually put out there to the public,
[00:48:52] like we're gonna have to make jeans in North Carolina
[00:48:56] and watch us pivot.
[00:48:58] And also follow us as we make mistakes,
[00:49:01] you know, and make tuition payments.
[00:49:02] But that mechanic that we flew up to Maine
[00:49:07] used to work in a denim factory.
[00:49:09] And he knew how to set up the machines down there
[00:49:11] and he knew how to tune them in.
[00:49:13] And he had all the beautiful tooling made.
[00:49:16] It was actually, it was so good.
[00:49:19] He made more and sent it to Maine
[00:49:20] so we could use it in Maine.
[00:49:22] So we made the pivot.
[00:49:23] It wasn't easy, but we got it done.
[00:49:25] And we're still not producing enough.
[00:49:28] And I remember saying to, I don't know if I called you,
[00:49:34] while we were down there getting to know the area,
[00:49:37] this is Ashboro, North Carolina,
[00:49:40] I drove by a building and it said on a trailer
[00:49:45] outside of the building, it said Texas jeans on it.
[00:49:50] And I remember just asking Jason, like, what is that?
[00:49:53] And he was like, oh, that's this old guy, Wally.
[00:49:56] And he's been in the denim business for ever.
[00:50:01] Come to find out and I didn't know this.
[00:50:03] I learned that North Carolina
[00:50:05] was the denim capital of America.
[00:50:08] And I'm like, so he's got like denim machines
[00:50:11] and people making jeans in there and everything.
[00:50:14] He's like, yeah, so again, another situation.
[00:50:18] We leaned into it a little bit,
[00:50:20] literally knocked on the door, went in
[00:50:23] and started having a conversation.
[00:50:27] It all started with a conversation.
[00:50:30] I know when you're talking about going back to factory one,
[00:50:33] Jason Gatti, all right, you got this guy.
[00:50:36] I just want to kind of profile him just for a minute.
[00:50:39] Did you see a transition in his,
[00:50:42] because look, the only Jason I've known is 100%.
[00:50:47] Let's make some shit happen now.
[00:50:49] We got this, here's what we need to do.
[00:50:51] That's the only Jason I know.
[00:50:53] Was that the only Jason you know?
[00:50:54] Was that a turnaround?
[00:50:56] Was there a turning point for him
[00:50:58] where he realized that this was the right thing to do?
[00:51:02] Because I mean, like I said, I've seen nothing but Jason,
[00:51:06] nothing from Jason except for like a 100%
[00:51:10] positive awesome attitude to make things happen.
[00:51:13] And also be like, no, hey, we're not gonna be able to do that.
[00:51:16] Or if we're gonna do that, here's what we're gonna need.
[00:51:18] Like that kind of thing.
[00:51:19] Was he like that the whole time?
[00:51:21] I would say his level of positivity was always consistent.
[00:51:26] Nice.
[00:51:27] And if there was anything he was feeling,
[00:51:29] he definitely didn't show it.
[00:51:31] Now, with that said, we had a lot of private conversations.
[00:51:34] A lot of private conversations.
[00:51:36] He educated me on the way they survived over the past 30 years.
[00:51:40] He educated me on the restructuring they had to go through,
[00:51:43] with the banks coming in and pulling apart the company
[00:51:46] and putting it back together and putting a CEO in place
[00:51:50] and how he fell.
[00:51:50] And like they went through some shit, man.
[00:51:54] Like after NAFTA and the WTO,
[00:51:56] like they went through some serious shit
[00:51:57] and he was part of it.
[00:51:59] So there's this protective kind of defense mechanism there
[00:52:03] that he's looking out for his people.
[00:52:07] And again, regardless of this new found relationship
[00:52:12] and working towards this kind of new culture,
[00:52:18] you're still blending two cultures together
[00:52:21] and two companies together.
[00:52:22] So there was definitely some apprehension behind the scenes
[00:52:26] and we had lots and lots of in-depth conversations.
[00:52:29] Some intense conversations too.
[00:52:31] The good thing with him is like he's a type of guy
[00:52:36] and maybe at some point it'd be good to have him on podcast
[00:52:38] but he's the type of guy that he's a survivor.
[00:52:41] He's a survivor, man.
[00:52:43] I was gonna throw that out.
[00:52:45] You talk about all these restructurings
[00:52:46] and all these things going on and putting a new,
[00:52:48] and he's the guy that's there.
[00:52:49] He's there and he's been through some shit in his life
[00:52:52] and he's a survivor.
[00:52:56] So it's tough when you have built something for so long
[00:53:05] to then I'm just gonna say abandon it.
[00:53:08] You've been building this thing for 20, 30 years
[00:53:12] and some freaking Yankee is coming down,
[00:53:16] asking you to abandon it.
[00:53:19] Cause that's ultimately the end goal, right?
[00:53:21] Is you're gonna abandon this and you're gonna,
[00:53:25] and I'm asking you to fully buy into what we're doing.
[00:53:28] Unproven, completely unproven.
[00:53:31] Just from watching some freaking YouTube videos
[00:53:33] and knowing, you know, Jocko's my other partner.
[00:53:36] It's still, even though you can buy into that
[00:53:40] and you can trust it, your livelihood
[00:53:43] and all these people's livelihood,
[00:53:45] you're betting that we're gonna do the right thing
[00:53:49] without that trust and that bond being built.
[00:53:52] So, yeah.
[00:53:54] Another comment I make a lot when I'm working
[00:53:57] with companies is, you know, they say,
[00:53:59] well, you know, you guys win the SEAL teams
[00:54:01] and you're dealing with life, life and death
[00:54:02] and be dealing with people's lives.
[00:54:03] I always say, you know, we dealt with people's lives,
[00:54:06] you deal with people's livelihoods.
[00:54:08] And that's the thing about Jason,
[00:54:09] you could tell that total positive attitude,
[00:54:12] you could also see that family attitude towards his people,
[00:54:20] that he wanted to take care of his people.
[00:54:22] Like, he needed to survive
[00:54:25] because that meant his people would survive.
[00:54:27] Like you could feel that when you talk to him.
[00:54:29] Yeah, he's intense and, you know, thank God
[00:54:32] he was willing to go to a muster.
[00:54:35] And he went to that muster and it changed his life.
[00:54:38] He literally said, Pete, I have learned more about myself
[00:54:43] and I'm growing every day, man, you know,
[00:54:45] and his thick Southern accent.
[00:54:48] And, you know, J.P. took him under his wing
[00:54:51] and a couple other, you know, the instructors
[00:54:55] and really dug in with him.
[00:54:57] They dug in and kind of, I don't wanna say like remolded
[00:55:02] but remolded the way he thinks and is walking through life
[00:55:06] and thinking about business.
[00:55:08] And that was so important.
[00:55:10] Honestly, if he didn't go to that muster,
[00:55:15] I don't know, I don't know where we would be right now
[00:55:19] if he didn't go to that muster.
[00:55:20] Well, as we get into the next factory,
[00:55:22] you can see, like I would be observing and going,
[00:55:26] oh yeah, he's got this.
[00:55:27] He understood, he understands this part.
[00:55:29] He understands that part.
[00:55:30] He understands this concept.
[00:55:31] He understands that concept.
[00:55:32] You could see that.
[00:55:33] I could see that.
[00:55:35] And believe me, I look at this stuff all day long.
[00:55:38] I look at meetings all day long.
[00:55:40] I sit with companies all day long.
[00:55:42] I sit in boardrooms all day long.
[00:55:43] I go to manufacturing floor.
[00:55:45] This is what I do all day.
[00:55:46] So for me sitting there watching this,
[00:55:47] it's like, oh, okay.
[00:55:48] I can see when people are disconnected.
[00:55:51] I can see when they don't understand what's happening.
[00:55:53] I can see when there's some agendas that they're,
[00:55:56] I can see all that.
[00:55:57] And you didn't see it at all from him.
[00:55:59] I saw that he did.
[00:56:01] And what's cool too is being a survivor.
[00:56:05] We say that as a positive thing, right?
[00:56:07] But we also know that, and just like any other characteristic,
[00:56:12] if someone's a survivor,
[00:56:14] and that's kind of a get in that survivor mode,
[00:56:17] it can be an absolute negative
[00:56:18] because they're trying to survive
[00:56:19] and they're not trying to grow
[00:56:20] and they're not trying to thrive, which is problematic.
[00:56:24] And so I think that transition from him just going,
[00:56:27] hey, I'm just gonna make sure I take care
[00:56:28] of what I've got right now into a growth mindset
[00:56:31] and a thrive mindset of, oh,
[00:56:33] we can actually not just survive,
[00:56:36] but actually grow and take over and crush.
[00:56:41] I think that was a pretty awesome transition
[00:56:43] for Jason Gattie to make.
[00:56:45] Yeah, it was, it was.
[00:56:46] So now you're driving around Ashboro, North Carolina.
[00:56:50] Shout out.
[00:56:52] And you drive by this building.
[00:56:54] And you see a trailer sitting on,
[00:56:56] by the way, it's a big building.
[00:56:58] It's a huge building, but it's very nondescript.
[00:57:01] Yeah, it's nondescript.
[00:57:03] It's got this trailer with the Texas Jains.
[00:57:05] And just in terms of timeline here,
[00:57:09] like I had seen this building during the deal making
[00:57:16] for that first factory.
[00:57:18] I had seen it and-
[00:57:20] You mean driven by it?
[00:57:21] Yeah, just looked at it.
[00:57:22] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:57:22] And actually I think we tried to get in,
[00:57:26] but we weren't able to.
[00:57:28] Like the guy there was just not interested
[00:57:30] in talking to us or anything.
[00:57:32] So it was kind of a blip, right?
[00:57:33] It was like, oh, what's that?
[00:57:37] And it kind of a blip, tried to get in, could get in, whatever.
[00:57:40] So it came back up and I had remembered,
[00:57:44] oh, there's this thing.
[00:57:46] So drove back by it, called Jason,
[00:57:49] do you know who owns this?
[00:57:51] Do you have the contact information?
[00:57:52] Is there any way we can talk?
[00:57:53] And Jason's like, yeah, I know who it is.
[00:57:57] Basically like, good luck.
[00:57:58] You know what I mean?
[00:57:59] With this whole thing.
[00:58:01] And I said, well, we're making jeans in Maine.
[00:58:05] We're making jeans in North Carolina.
[00:58:08] Things are working, but at the pace we're selling, right?
[00:58:13] At the pace of product that we're selling,
[00:58:14] because we're a company that literally,
[00:58:17] we take an order in and we manufacture the thing.
[00:58:19] So we're selling a thousand pairs a week right now
[00:58:22] on top of the 10,000 in back order.
[00:58:24] So we're now pushed out from Black Friday,
[00:58:27] we're pushed out for five months,
[00:58:30] which is completely unacceptable.
[00:58:33] It's completely unacceptable in this world
[00:58:34] of getting shit from Amazon dropped in by a drone, right?
[00:58:38] Like an hour after you order it.
[00:58:39] So it just was like, I kind of looked at the numbers
[00:58:45] and the run rate of what we're selling and I'm like,
[00:58:48] it just doesn't work.
[00:58:49] This ain't happening.
[00:58:50] This just doesn't work.
[00:58:51] Can you remember that phone call?
[00:58:52] Like we're not gonna be able to ever produce
[00:58:56] what we need to produce at this run rate
[00:58:57] with this kind of growth trajectory.
[00:58:59] So Jason connected me with the son of the owner.
[00:59:06] The son of the owner connected me with the owner.
[00:59:10] Again, not for sale.
[00:59:14] He entertained me.
[00:59:16] He entertained me in this old 1970s boardroom
[00:59:21] that had a distinct smell to it.
[00:59:25] Him and his wife, Dolores.
[00:59:30] And I could tell this dude was hard.
[00:59:33] You know, like just the way he carried himself,
[00:59:36] the way he looked at me, the way he interacted.
[00:59:39] He even told me, if I was your age, I would kick your ass.
[00:59:44] He said, I would kick your ass and I'd kick your ass
[00:59:47] in business.
[00:59:48] You couldn't touch me.
[00:59:50] You can't compete with me.
[00:59:51] You don't know what I know.
[00:59:53] What I've done out in this plant, I went out in the plant.
[00:59:56] He actually did bring me out in the plant
[00:59:57] for a couple of minutes and I asked the son
[01:00:00] if I could shoot photos and he's like, yeah, go ahead.
[01:00:02] And then he saw me shooting photos
[01:00:03] and he said to Jason, Gatti goes,
[01:00:06] if I see that dude shoot another photo,
[01:00:08] I'm gonna knee cap him right here.
[01:00:10] I mean, that's the type of dude we're dealing with.
[01:00:13] Just to put this in a little bit of perspective.
[01:00:18] So how long had he been in this business for?
[01:00:21] 50 years.
[01:00:22] So if you don't know this, if you don't know this,
[01:00:26] this is the old school way.
[01:00:31] And back in the day, well, look at the history, 50 years.
[01:00:36] This is when you had the like union issues.
[01:00:40] This is when you anti-union issues.
[01:00:43] This is when you had a massive influence
[01:00:45] from organized crime in the textile industry.
[01:00:48] Like this is when you had intense, intense competition
[01:00:53] in America, because this is before everything's overseas.
[01:00:54] So now you've got like the most intense competition.
[01:00:59] And this guy, you wanna talk about a survivor and a thriver.
[01:01:03] This is a guy that dominated and dominated for 50 years
[01:01:08] and worked and if you were not a badass,
[01:01:13] you weren't gonna make it.
[01:01:15] It wasn't gonna happen.
[01:01:16] And if you weren't a badass,
[01:01:17] you were gonna get your ass kicked.
[01:01:19] And that's what he did.
[01:01:20] He went around.
[01:01:21] And that's why he was, you know,
[01:01:23] the last standing wash house,
[01:01:26] the last denim plant from the golden age
[01:01:31] of textiles in America.
[01:01:32] This is the guy, the last standing guy.
[01:01:35] It's 100%.
[01:01:36] Right?
[01:01:37] The last one.
[01:01:38] I mean, you're talking about a plant
[01:01:40] that's 170,000 square feet with this wash house,
[01:01:44] now a storage room, right?
[01:01:48] With these big 500 pound washing machines
[01:01:52] that tip forward dump out, you know,
[01:01:54] the wash jeans.
[01:01:55] Like a dump truck, bro.
[01:01:56] Like a dump truck.
[01:01:57] Like a dump truck that haven't been running in years.
[01:02:00] The washing machines don't weigh 500 pounds.
[01:02:01] They wash 500 pounds, you know,
[01:02:04] a quarter ton worth of jeans.
[01:02:06] Yeah, they're nine feet tall.
[01:02:08] They're, I don't know how many thousands of pounds.
[01:02:10] They're massive, massive machines.
[01:02:13] But you know, you walk into this place
[01:02:15] and you could just tell it's like,
[01:02:18] man, like World War II,
[01:02:21] post World War II East Germany, Berlin.
[01:02:24] Like everything's just so closed and dark and dank.
[01:02:27] And it just had this,
[01:02:29] it had a survivor type of feeling.
[01:02:32] Like this thing exists out of sheer survival.
[01:02:36] Like it shouldn't exist.
[01:02:38] It shouldn't be here.
[01:02:39] It should have been gutted and turned into something else
[01:02:42] a long time ago.
[01:02:44] And this guy was not willing to let it go.
[01:02:47] Just force of will.
[01:02:48] Yeah, just a sheer force of will.
[01:02:50] So how did you navigate the conversation
[01:02:56] to go from this isn't for sale.
[01:02:59] And if you put your, don't put your camera away,
[01:03:01] I'm gonna knee cap you right here.
[01:03:03] How do you transition from that to,
[01:03:07] I mean, how do you even get him to open his mind
[01:03:09] a little bit?
[01:03:10] Well, let's just say that it didn't start off great.
[01:03:16] And ultimately it ended up good,
[01:03:18] but the ebbs and flows of our conversations
[01:03:22] in what transpired during this time was,
[01:03:27] not only the strangest negotiation I've ever been part of,
[01:03:34] but even more of one of the more heartfelt too.
[01:03:38] You know what I mean?
[01:03:39] It was a hard negotiation.
[01:03:41] It was hard to talk to him.
[01:03:43] It was hard to find common ground
[01:03:46] because of his passion and our passion for what we're doing.
[01:03:50] I think ultimately he saw something
[01:03:54] that he was willing to believe in, a spark of something.
[01:03:57] And not to get ahead of myself here,
[01:04:00] but the first time he walked in, I had Jason with me
[01:04:04] and while he walks in,
[01:04:05] and he's got his kind of the brows over his eyes
[01:04:09] and he kind of walks in and his wife's behind him
[01:04:12] and Jason's like, what up old timer?
[01:04:14] And while he looked at Jason
[01:04:17] and you could tell they probably had competed in the past
[01:04:20] or whatever, you got two strong Southern men.
[01:04:27] And while he said something smart to Jason,
[01:04:30] like I'll kick your ass or something like that,
[01:04:32] I was just like, I literally put my head in my hand going,
[01:04:35] oh man, how is this gonna go?
[01:04:40] What I boiled down to was, he's in bad health
[01:04:46] and right now, while he's actually not doing good.
[01:04:49] I actually wanted to interview him
[01:04:51] for the documentary we've been working on
[01:04:53] and I've asked three times, I've talked to him,
[01:04:56] I've talked to his wife and at this point,
[01:04:58] I'm probably annoying about it, but he won't do it.
[01:05:00] And he said to me because I remember things a certain way
[01:05:05] and somebody else remembers them another way.
[01:05:09] And I can respect that,
[01:05:11] but some of the stories he told me, which I can't share,
[01:05:14] I can share some of them,
[01:05:15] but are unbelievable, straight out of a movie,
[01:05:20] with organized crime and all that stuff.
[01:05:23] But ultimately, we spent 20 hours over the course
[01:05:26] of a few weeks in that boardroom talking and negotiating.
[01:05:32] He started the negotiation with,
[01:05:34] you are not seeing my books, you are not seeing my financials.
[01:05:40] If you wanna get this thing done,
[01:05:42] he's like, you're gonna, number one,
[01:05:44] you don't have to tell me why,
[01:05:45] because I got somebody ready to stroke me a check right now.
[01:05:48] And that's the person I'm gonna sell it to.
[01:05:51] That's how the negotiation started.
[01:05:54] There were times where this wasn't happening.
[01:05:58] Oh, yeah.
[01:05:59] And let me first start off by saying this.
[01:06:02] When you first called me about what it was,
[01:06:04] what the opportunity was, I was like,
[01:06:05] oh, this is next level.
[01:06:08] You're talking about an incredible staff of people
[01:06:10] that have an incredible skill set,
[01:06:12] an incredible amount of machinery,
[01:06:16] a space that's 170,000 square feet,
[01:06:19] a space that's grandfathered,
[01:06:22] as far as like a wash house,
[01:06:24] you can't build a wash house like that,
[01:06:25] you can't do it anymore.
[01:06:27] There are things that are once in a lifetime.
[01:06:30] This was a once in a lifetime opportunity.
[01:06:32] So I was, and of course, you're telling me,
[01:06:36] hey man, the genes thing that we're doing right now,
[01:06:39] we are not gonna be able to do this.
[01:06:42] And then all of a sudden, here comes like a ray of light.
[01:06:45] Like a lifeboat.
[01:06:47] Like divine intervention.
[01:06:48] Yeah, you're in the ocean, you're alive,
[01:06:52] but you're in the ocean.
[01:06:54] And all of a sudden, lifeboat comes.
[01:06:56] And this thing was like a lifeboat.
[01:06:58] And so I'm super stoked and you can always make deals happen.
[01:07:02] You can always make deals happen.
[01:07:04] You can always figure out a way.
[01:07:05] And my attitude is always,
[01:07:08] well, we'll figure out a way to make a deal.
[01:07:09] We'll make a deal.
[01:07:10] And there was some times in this,
[01:07:12] where we weren't making a deal,
[01:07:14] where it wasn't happening,
[01:07:16] where I just thought, yeah, man,
[01:07:18] what are we gonna do now?
[01:07:19] I was in plan BCD because you'd say,
[01:07:23] hey, let me debrief you on what just happened today.
[01:07:27] You know, and I'd be like, okay,
[01:07:30] the deal fell apart.
[01:07:32] Completely.
[01:07:33] Multiple times.
[01:07:34] And then it would come back together.
[01:07:36] And then it would fall apart.
[01:07:37] But it wasn't like, it didn't seem like
[01:07:40] those deals falling apart were any negotiation.
[01:07:43] It seemed like it just died.
[01:07:44] Like it wasn't like, oh, you know,
[01:07:46] he's hardballing us or he's gonna hold a little bit
[01:07:49] or we gotta come back with a different number.
[01:07:51] It was like, no, you know what?
[01:07:52] I'm actually just not selling this to you anymore.
[01:07:55] Yeah, he didn't even, he honestly didn't care about
[01:08:00] what we were gonna pay for.
[01:08:02] It didn't really have anything to do with money.
[01:08:05] He wanted someone tough.
[01:08:10] That wasn't me, by the way.
[01:08:12] He wanted someone tough who could come in there
[01:08:18] and demand respect that knew how to interact with people
[01:08:26] that understood the business that could carry on his legacy.
[01:08:31] And after 20 hours of negotiation, that wasn't me.
[01:08:33] And I'll share with you in a second
[01:08:35] who it was.
[01:08:38] At that table, that conference table,
[01:08:41] and flying back and forth and having these meetings,
[01:08:44] I did learn something very important about negotiation.
[01:08:49] In negotiation with someone who is so passionate
[01:08:54] about something that they've been building
[01:08:56] for 40, 50 years, 50 years,
[01:08:59] remember this guy had seven plants around North Carolina.
[01:09:03] He made it through the exportation of our jobs
[01:09:09] and machinery in the abandoned communities.
[01:09:12] He survived it.
[01:09:14] You know, and the other thing is,
[01:09:22] this guy, I don't know, he's the last of his kind.
[01:09:29] I think is what it boils down to.
[01:09:31] And he doesn't really believe that anyone can do what he does.
[01:09:34] You ever met somebody like that?
[01:09:36] There is nobody alive that can do what I do.
[01:09:40] He made the jeans for Levi's.
[01:09:42] He made the jeans for Wrangler.
[01:09:44] He made the jeans for Calvin Klein.
[01:09:47] On one case he shared with me,
[01:09:49] he got a contract for Calvin Klein
[01:09:52] and a guy showed up in his office unannounced.
[01:09:56] His secretary comes to see him.
[01:09:58] Hey, there's somebody here to see you.
[01:10:01] And he's like, okay.
[01:10:03] And the guy comes in his office
[01:10:06] and he puts two plane tickets on his desk,
[01:10:09] tells him where, I know where you live.
[01:10:12] I know everything about you.
[01:10:16] Basically, you're coming with me.
[01:10:18] And on the other end of those tickets
[01:10:20] was a guy named Whitey Bulger.
[01:10:23] Wally's like, hold on a second.
[01:10:26] Tells the guy to chill out for a second.
[01:10:30] Gets on the phone, calls a friend of his
[01:10:33] up in New York City saying,
[01:10:35] hey, I got a guy here named Whitey Bulger.
[01:10:38] He's like, he's asking me to pay money.
[01:10:42] He's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Wally, hold on.
[01:10:45] Who? He's like Whitey Bulger.
[01:10:47] He goes, who are you making jeans for?
[01:10:50] He says, Calvin Klein.
[01:10:52] He goes, I'll call you back in 15 minutes.
[01:10:55] Come to find out.
[01:10:57] His friend had the connections.
[01:10:59] I don't even know if I should be sharing this shit, bro.
[01:11:02] His friend had the connections to get to the top.
[01:11:06] And Whitey, basically he gets a phone call back.
[01:11:09] They're like, is Mr. Bulger there?
[01:11:11] Puts him on the phone with Mr. Bulger.
[01:11:13] And Whitey's, he said, I just heard the guy go, yep, yep.
[01:11:18] Yep, got it.
[01:11:18] Okay, puts the phone down and leaves.
[01:11:22] He wasn't paying for every pair of jeans
[01:11:25] that he was making.
[01:11:27] He wasn't giving the cut.
[01:11:29] Wasn't giving the cut.
[01:11:30] He didn't know he was supposed to be giving the cut.
[01:11:32] It had never filtered down to him.
[01:11:35] So he started receiving checks with the cut taken out
[01:11:38] for the product.
[01:11:40] There was a lot of stories like this.
[01:11:42] There was some pretty, there was some stories
[01:11:44] that he was telling me.
[01:11:45] And I think the point is, is he wanted me
[01:11:47] to know how tough he was.
[01:11:49] Now, here's a guy who's at end of life.
[01:11:53] You know, it's actually kind of, it's kind of sad too.
[01:11:55] He's at end of life.
[01:11:57] He's built this empire.
[01:11:58] He's invested everything in this.
[01:12:01] He's the best in the world at it.
[01:12:04] He's in the best in the world at making denim blue jeans.
[01:12:11] And he's staring at death.
[01:12:17] We spent a week negotiating, two weeks negotiating,
[01:12:21] and then it's just radio silence.
[01:12:23] There's no more conversation.
[01:12:26] I'm trying to figure out what's going on.
[01:12:28] I think the deal's done, man.
[01:12:30] I think it's dead.
[01:12:31] There's no more conversation.
[01:12:32] There was another entity.
[01:12:34] Another entity that wanted a purchase of it.
[01:12:36] That wonderbuy that had a ton of money,
[01:12:38] backed by massive, massive hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:12:42] and they were ready to roll in there.
[01:12:44] I finally get on the phone with his wife, Dolores,
[01:12:47] got her cell phone number.
[01:12:48] She sounds pretty wound up.
[01:12:50] You know, hey, Wally, he's in the hospital.
[01:12:55] Why don't you come down next week?
[01:12:58] So I go back down.
[01:13:00] I'm sitting in the boardroom.
[01:13:01] Wally comes in and he sits down.
[01:13:04] You know, and he's looking rough and he's welling up.
[01:13:09] You know what I mean?
[01:13:10] He's just, he's welling up in his eyes and I'm like,
[01:13:12] what's going on?
[01:13:14] He basically said, nobody knows this.
[01:13:15] I haven't even shared it with my son.
[01:13:18] But he had a heart attack and he died.
[01:13:26] Called, I guess his wife called.
[01:13:28] They brought him back to life, got him back
[01:13:32] and they actually said,
[01:13:32] there is no way you should be alive right now.
[01:13:36] You must have more to do.
[01:13:39] And that was the defining moment
[01:13:41] where he opened up back for negotiation
[01:13:43] where he just, he was staring death in the face
[01:13:47] and then he dies, he gets brought back to life
[01:13:51] and now I'm sitting in a board with him
[01:13:53] and I have my wife next to me, Amanda.
[01:13:57] And I knew bringing her down was gonna be important
[01:14:02] because him and his wife have been doing this thing
[01:14:06] and they've been a unit.
[01:14:07] You know, they've just, they're like-minded
[01:14:11] in one place off the other one
[01:14:13] and similar to the way Amanda is and I am.
[01:14:16] And it was then that he decided that we had what it took,
[01:14:23] that I didn't have what it took,
[01:14:25] but that she had what it took.
[01:14:27] Cause he was asking, he asked me,
[01:14:30] actually asked me to bring her down.
[01:14:32] I said, Amanda, I wanna bring you down North Carolina.
[01:14:34] Listen, Wally's asking to meet you.
[01:14:36] She's like, why do I need to go?
[01:14:37] She's like, this is your thing.
[01:14:38] This is what you do.
[01:14:39] I said, I don't know.
[01:14:41] I said, he wants to meet you.
[01:14:43] And I called him back.
[01:14:45] Yeah, I'm gonna be coming down.
[01:14:46] He's like, you're gonna bring Amanda, right?
[01:14:48] And I'm like, yes, I'm gonna bring Amanda.
[01:14:52] He stared at me across the table and he said to me,
[01:14:56] he goes, he's like, you can't do this.
[01:14:58] He goes, I don't trust you can do it.
[01:15:01] He goes, but she can.
[01:15:04] I watched the way she moves.
[01:15:05] I watched the way she walks.
[01:15:07] I watched the way she interacts.
[01:15:08] I said, she can make this happen.
[01:15:11] And I wouldn't do a deal with you,
[01:15:12] but I'll do a deal with her.
[01:15:14] And I said, you're right.
[01:15:19] Yeah.
[01:15:20] You're right, man.
[01:15:21] I know, man, I agree with Wally, bro.
[01:15:23] 100%.
[01:15:25] It's like, you're right.
[01:15:26] And you know, that was the turning point, man.
[01:15:29] The guy died, got brought back to life.
[01:15:31] He saw his legacy in front of him.
[01:15:33] He saw, you know, a family.
[01:15:37] And I'm talking about a family.
[01:15:39] He's, of course, the Jocko thing came into play
[01:15:42] because he had a special forces guy that lives next door
[01:15:45] to him who told him all about you.
[01:15:48] So you've got people who are hungry to bring back
[01:15:50] manufacturing in America.
[01:15:52] And it was at that point that he believed
[01:15:55] that we could carry on his legacy and things move forward.
[01:16:00] And bro, like even with even his belief
[01:16:04] that it could move forward, that we could handle it
[01:16:06] was still, it was still just the beginning
[01:16:09] of all the bullshit that we had to go through
[01:16:13] to make the deal happen.
[01:16:15] Well, one thing I remember, another point was,
[01:16:19] there was, you call me up and you're like,
[01:16:22] it ain't happening.
[01:16:23] Or you send me a text like, it ain't happening.
[01:16:26] And I'm like, oh, you know, well,
[01:16:28] so we get on the phone and you're like,
[01:16:32] hey, we're going through the due diligence and whatnot.
[01:16:37] And there's no phase two environmental study.
[01:16:40] Hasn't been done in 30 years or whatever, 40 years.
[01:16:43] And you're like, hey, man, if this comes up bad,
[01:16:49] we could be out a million, two million dollars
[01:16:52] worth of like cleanup and repair and payments.
[01:16:56] And you're like, we just don't know.
[01:16:59] And I remember I'm like, okay.
[01:17:02] I said, hey, man, how much would it cost us
[01:17:04] to build that factory?
[01:17:06] And you're like, I don't know.
[01:17:09] You're like, oh, you're running the numbers.
[01:17:11] You're like 25, 20, 25, maybe 30 million.
[01:17:15] And I go, let's do this deal.
[01:17:18] You're like, Roger that, you know?
[01:17:20] And that's again, that's one of those things
[01:17:22] where you were really close to the deal, of course.
[01:17:25] But I looked at, that's actually a small risk
[01:17:28] when you put it up against what we would have to have done.
[01:17:31] And look, even if we had a billion dollars,
[01:17:35] to say, okay, now go build that factory.
[01:17:38] How long does that take?
[01:17:39] Now go get those people.
[01:17:41] Where do you get them from?
[01:17:42] Now train those people.
[01:17:43] It's maybe seven years.
[01:17:46] Like literally seven years.
[01:17:48] If we had a billion dollars,
[01:17:49] it would have taken seven years.
[01:17:50] So those little risks, those additional risks
[01:17:53] that you take, because it's a once in a lifetime.
[01:17:57] This is a once in a lifetime deal.
[01:17:59] Yeah, it is.
[01:18:01] It shouldn't have existed and it shouldn't have happened.
[01:18:09] One person's sheer force of will
[01:18:12] to hang on to the golden age of manufacturing.
[01:18:18] One person's decision is actually gonna spearhead
[01:18:23] this Renaissance, this revolution of manufacturing.
[01:18:26] We're actually just dovetailing onto that thing
[01:18:29] to carry it forward.
[01:18:31] He was like the underground resistance for 40 years.
[01:18:35] Just like sitting in a cave, keeping those machines on,
[01:18:39] just keeping it going.
[01:18:40] And everybody I come in contact with.
[01:18:43] Everybody I came in contact with since then has said,
[01:18:46] oh, you're the owner of the new of Wally's factory.
[01:18:52] I said, yeah, and they're like,
[01:18:54] can't believe you got that done with Wally.
[01:18:57] Like, I mean, everybody knows the guy
[01:18:59] and he's a hard ass, man.
[01:19:01] Dude's a hard ass, but ultimately it got done.
[01:19:06] We got it done.
[01:19:08] Freaking sign the papers.
[01:19:09] Yeah, we got it done when they're like,
[01:19:11] one of his stipends right at the end of this whole thing
[01:19:14] was like a cliffhanger, right?
[01:19:15] Hey, okay, I want the money in a week.
[01:19:18] That's, yeah.
[01:19:19] The guy's crazy, man.
[01:19:22] He's crazy.
[01:19:23] I want the money in a week.
[01:19:25] Do we escrow him some funds?
[01:19:27] Oh, I mean, I remember wiring big fat numbers around
[01:19:31] and going, yeah.
[01:19:32] And here's the other thing,
[01:19:33] like you kind of breeze through this,
[01:19:35] but you can't see my books and you can't see my financials.
[01:19:38] No, he actually had a piece of like just notebook paper.
[01:19:43] And he wrote on his revenue what he did.
[01:19:46] He's like, this is how much I pay for heat.
[01:19:49] This is how much, this is my payroll.
[01:19:53] Here's lights electric.
[01:19:55] He goes, and here's the revenue.
[01:19:58] And you can see this is how this is the math works.
[01:20:03] And that's cool.
[01:20:04] You're like, hey, Roger, that you should,
[01:20:05] you sent me a text of a napkin or whatever.
[01:20:08] Like, hey, John, this is what we're buying.
[01:20:10] Recording to the napkin.
[01:20:11] I think most people walking in there would be like,
[01:20:15] this is like, this guy's crazy.
[01:20:18] Like this is a shithole.
[01:20:19] Yeah.
[01:20:20] And I think it's the future.
[01:20:24] Yeah. And I think, thankfully, you had the understanding
[01:20:29] of the true value.
[01:20:31] And I think just like every good deal,
[01:20:33] like he got what he wanted.
[01:20:38] He really did.
[01:20:39] He got a team that's going to come on board,
[01:20:43] that's going to continue that fight,
[01:20:45] that's going to expand that fight.
[01:20:47] And that's what he wanted.
[01:20:50] And then all parties can walk away feeling good
[01:20:54] about the deal.
[01:20:54] That's a great deal when that happens.
[01:20:59] And then it's like you finally get to go into the factory
[01:21:04] for the first time.
[01:21:06] And this is like buying a car.
[01:21:08] This is like walking up, seeing a car in the parking lot.
[01:21:11] And the guy's like, hey, I'll sell you that car.
[01:21:13] Over on the other side of the parking lot.
[01:21:14] Can tell what it's a Corolla.
[01:21:16] It's a Toyota Corolla.
[01:21:19] And you're like, how many miles?
[01:21:20] He's like, don't worry about it.
[01:21:21] Can I kick the tires?
[01:21:22] Nope.
[01:21:24] Is there an engine in it?
[01:21:25] Is there an engine in it?
[01:21:26] I'm telling you there is.
[01:21:27] I drove it here.
[01:21:28] How long time ago?
[01:21:30] So you just need to buy this thing.
[01:21:31] So you finally get to look under the hood of this thing.
[01:21:34] What would you see?
[01:21:35] What did we actually buy when you got in there?
[01:21:38] You know, I think that, I mean, where
[01:21:44] to go with that question.
[01:21:46] I could go so many different directions.
[01:21:49] I think we bought exactly what we needed.
[01:21:52] And the challenge was that I didn't anticipate
[01:21:57] was a double merger of companies and cultures.
[01:22:01] A double merger of companies and cultures.
[01:22:05] I did not anticipate the difficulty of that.
[01:22:10] Yeah, we went in there.
[01:22:11] We stripped out 17 roll off dumpsters full of stuff.
[01:22:16] We gutted the lights and put all LEDs.
[01:22:18] We put $75,000 of freon into the system.
[01:22:22] So we had cooling in there.
[01:22:23] So it wasn't a sweatshop.
[01:22:25] Like we went through and with machinery.
[01:22:28] We bought new machinery.
[01:22:29] We stripped stuff apart.
[01:22:30] We built a fulfillment center.
[01:22:31] We stripped out the warehouse.
[01:22:32] We got new controllers, custom controllers.
[01:22:34] We bought new dryers.
[01:22:35] Like we, I mean, we did everything we
[01:22:36] need to do for an infrastructure.
[01:22:37] But a double merger of companies and culture
[01:22:41] was the tricky part.
[01:22:42] That the first pictures you're sending me.
[01:22:48] You're like half laughing and half crying.
[01:22:52] You're like, back there, there's a wash house.
[01:22:56] It's in there.
[01:22:57] There's just piles of equipment.
[01:23:00] And it looked like areas of the factory obviously
[01:23:02] hadn't been cleaned or used in decades.
[01:23:05] In decades.
[01:23:09] I remember you excited because you found the floor.
[01:23:13] In some of the areas, you actually got enough stuff
[01:23:16] out of there so that you found the floor.
[01:23:19] People were smoking inside the building, Chaco.
[01:23:21] Cigarettes.
[01:23:23] I walked through and I'm like, I'm walking.
[01:23:25] I'm walking.
[01:23:25] I'm like, I'm like, huh, there must be some smoke coming in.
[01:23:30] And I walked by and there's a person smoking a cigarette.
[01:23:33] I'm talking, this is straight out of the 70s, bro.
[01:23:36] Like shit hasn't changed since 1970.
[01:23:41] Same type of a culture.
[01:23:43] Same type of a setup hasn't changed.
[01:23:47] It looked rough.
[01:23:48] Now you're going to tell everybody to change.
[01:23:50] The cool thing was, before we get to the merge
[01:23:53] and the cultures, that, and I've been talking about this
[01:23:57] a decent amount lately.
[01:23:58] So we even say it, I'm fine.
[01:24:01] OK, it's not what you hang on the wall.
[01:24:03] You can't just run around with a bunch of sayings.
[01:24:05] But actually, it kind of does help.
[01:24:07] And I talked about the fact that David Hackworth changed
[01:24:10] fighter company, or sorry, Fox company in Korea to fighter
[01:24:13] company.
[01:24:14] And he changed the hopeless in Vietnam.
[01:24:17] The 439th, he changed the hopeless to the hardcore.
[01:24:20] He just changed these names, changed these things.
[01:24:22] Hey, gave them little patches to wear on their uniforms, right?
[01:24:26] Made their salute into hardcore Rekondos.
[01:24:29] No fucking slack.
[01:24:30] Like he made these changes.
[01:24:32] Like just made them.
[01:24:33] And that starts to shift things.
[01:24:35] And out of the gate, you're just like cleaning.
[01:24:40] Just cleaning this place up, right?
[01:24:42] Getting rid of a lot of this junk.
[01:24:44] Getting rid of a lot of these old machines
[01:24:46] that didn't have any purpose anymore.
[01:24:48] Painting things.
[01:24:50] A wage increase across the board for everybody.
[01:24:53] Like out of the gate, no?
[01:24:54] Making $7.50 an hour to make a minimum North Carolina wage.
[01:24:59] $7.50 an hour.
[01:25:00] Who can live off a $7.50 an hour?
[01:25:03] So the wage increase, the cooling system
[01:25:06] you're talking about, I mean, you know?
[01:25:08] Like you got to post that cooling system again.
[01:25:10] That thing's a monster.
[01:25:12] It's like I don't understand.
[01:25:13] Like you have a swamp cooler.
[01:25:15] There's like a small pool of water in there.
[01:25:17] You needed to cool off.
[01:25:18] You could dive in it.
[01:25:19] It's like crazy, right?
[01:25:20] But and what was the little bet you had with Kip?
[01:25:23] Like I'll give you $1,000 if you can get this thing running
[01:25:25] or something.
[01:25:26] What was the deal on that?
[01:25:27] Kip came down and he's, you got to remember,
[01:25:29] Kip spent in a lot of factories.
[01:25:30] And I hope he doesn't mind me sharing this.
[01:25:33] But he told me once, like he went into a factory.
[01:25:36] They drove, you know, an hour.
[01:25:38] Then they drove, you know, 15 miles down this dirt road.
[01:25:42] And then they then they at the corner of the dirt road,
[01:25:44] there was somebody carrying.
[01:25:45] He thought it was like bananas or something out of the forest.
[01:25:48] Then they drove down an elephant trail, another five miles
[01:25:52] into the middle of a jungle where people were like carrying
[01:25:56] out whatever he didn't know.
[01:26:00] And there's this building.
[01:26:01] There's this three story big brick building
[01:26:05] with bars on the windows.
[01:26:08] And he's like, don't tell me this is a factory.
[01:26:11] And he goes in and there's a bunch of girls,
[01:26:14] young, young girls in there sewing.
[01:26:18] And he's like, get me the hell out of here.
[01:26:21] And what those folks were carrying out in bare feet
[01:26:24] was the garments.
[01:26:26] And of course, you know, he's like, I think,
[01:26:30] I think for like Kip, like he knows what factories,
[01:26:33] good factories look like.
[01:26:35] He knows what infrastructure looks like.
[01:26:37] He knows what's right and he knows what's wrong.
[01:26:39] He's seen it all.
[01:26:41] He walked into that back room with Jason Gaddy.
[01:26:44] And Jason, you know how Jason is, he's like, you know,
[01:26:47] kind of get that sales personality.
[01:26:49] Oh my God, look at this.
[01:26:50] It got that.
[01:26:51] So cool.
[01:26:52] We got this.
[01:26:53] We got that.
[01:26:53] He's like, this thing, it shoots out.
[01:26:54] It'll cool this whole place down.
[01:26:55] And Kip's like, this thing ain't working, Jason.
[01:26:57] He's like, no, it's working.
[01:26:58] It's good to go.
[01:26:59] You just got to keep good walks.
[01:27:01] And he's like, yeah, there's no way.
[01:27:03] Yeah, there's no way this works.
[01:27:05] He's like, no, it works.
[01:27:06] And Kip's like, I don't know.
[01:27:07] I'll bet you $1,000 that this thing doesn't work.
[01:27:12] Come to find out.
[01:27:13] That shit didn't work.
[01:27:15] That shit didn't work.
[01:27:17] I think Kip found out like two weeks ago that we had
[01:27:21] to dump that type of cash into it.
[01:27:22] But stuff like that, definitely important.
[01:27:27] Well, all that was happening for me, it was more of,
[01:27:30] how am I going to connect with the people
[01:27:33] that have learned leadership from Wally?
[01:27:38] Again, this dude is living in the 70s, 80s,
[01:27:41] where you protected your own at whatever cost.
[01:27:47] How am I going to untangle and reeducate
[01:27:53] what our culture is like, how we lead, how we treat people?
[01:27:57] And I remember the first thing I did was I went up
[01:28:00] to the three managers and they're all looking at me
[01:28:04] like, who is this guy?
[01:28:06] You know what I mean?
[01:28:06] And I just, I said to them, I said, listen, I said,
[01:28:12] they're like, are you going to fire us?
[01:28:14] I said, no, I'm not going to fire you.
[01:28:15] Are you going to fire us and bring your own people in?
[01:28:17] No.
[01:28:18] Well, how do we know that?
[01:28:20] I said, we didn't buy this place because of the machinery
[01:28:25] or the building.
[01:28:26] I said, we bought it because of the people.
[01:28:28] I said, that woman over there, that's felling jeans.
[01:28:32] I have never seen anything like it.
[01:28:35] That one over there.
[01:28:36] I said, I've never seen anything like it.
[01:28:37] I said, the skill here you don't find in America anymore.
[01:28:41] I said, we're here because of you and nothing else.
[01:28:45] That's it.
[01:28:46] And the one, there's this one woman and she's staring at me,
[01:28:51] staring through me.
[01:28:53] I was actually a little bit feared for my life.
[01:28:56] And I get done and she does this little smirk
[01:28:58] and she smiles, she goes, I like you.
[01:29:02] And she just walks off.
[01:29:03] And it was like a lot of those,
[01:29:05] keeping those conversations warm and touch points.
[01:29:09] It was just the beginning.
[01:29:12] We're in process right now, obviously,
[01:29:15] of trying to continue changing the culture.
[01:29:18] It's difficult, man.
[01:29:20] I mean, obviously you've come down twice already.
[01:29:22] What did you think when you first walked in
[01:29:24] for the first time?
[01:29:25] I was freaking totally stoked.
[01:29:28] But you can tell, again, this is something
[01:29:32] that I get to see a lot at Eshalon Front.
[01:29:34] And I get to see it in the military too.
[01:29:36] You could tell that the people had some level of,
[01:29:43] for lack of a better word, I've said this phrase
[01:29:45] the other day, post-traumatic leadership disorder.
[01:29:50] Right?
[01:29:50] Yeah, so you have Wally, who's a survivor,
[01:29:54] who's going to crush, destroy, kick ass to make this work.
[01:30:01] And what does that translate to
[01:30:02] on the front lines, tyrannical leadership?
[01:30:04] Like you're gonna shut up and do it the way I'm telling you.
[01:30:06] That's it, that's the way it is.
[01:30:08] And you could tell that that's the environment
[01:30:10] that these folks, now by the time I got down there,
[01:30:12] again, the lights were in, the place was clean.
[01:30:16] So you started to see, I could smell the hope, right?
[01:30:22] I could start to smell, but then we'll get into
[01:30:23] some of the conversations that we had as we went forward.
[01:30:26] And as Eshalon Front showed up there,
[01:30:28] you could start to see, okay, but when I got in there,
[01:30:32] I actually saw hope and I saw people looking at me
[01:30:36] and as I started talking to people,
[01:30:39] you see that there's hope there
[01:30:40] and they were ready for that transition.
[01:30:42] What's, so we'll get to that.
[01:30:46] In the meantime, the other monster is out there.
[01:30:50] I think people really gotta understand.
[01:30:51] There's two monsters, we're walking through the factory
[01:30:54] getting phone calls about this other thing.
[01:30:56] 100%.
[01:30:56] And we're doing this other thing,
[01:30:57] we're getting phone calls about these deals.
[01:30:59] It's just, it's a lot, it's a lot.
[01:31:02] The other monster now.
[01:31:03] It's a freaking lot, right?
[01:31:04] The other monster's hungry.
[01:31:06] We, one of the main things that we wanted to get done
[01:31:10] was make a ready to drink moque
[01:31:13] that people could go into a store and say,
[01:31:17] hey, I need protein right now.
[01:31:19] I need to fill myself up.
[01:31:21] I need some nutrition.
[01:31:22] I want it to be healthy.
[01:31:24] We need ready to drink moque.
[01:31:27] We've had great success and supreme demand
[01:31:31] for the powdered moque.
[01:31:32] I mean, it's the best stuff going.
[01:31:34] So, but people, sometimes you don't have time to,
[01:31:36] you don't have a shape, cup, all those things.
[01:31:37] So we need to make a ready to drink moque.
[01:31:40] And that was a cha, cha, cha challenge.
[01:31:46] Yeah, that's true.
[01:31:47] A challenge to make the right formula.
[01:31:48] A challenge to make the formula as healthy
[01:31:51] as it can possibly be, as efficacious as it can possibly be.
[01:31:55] And you gotta counter that with making it taste as good
[01:31:58] as you can possibly make it.
[01:31:59] So people wanna drink it so it tastes good.
[01:32:02] And so we have all those just to formulate the thing.
[01:32:06] And once you formulate it, guess what you gotta do?
[01:32:08] You gotta actually make it.
[01:32:11] So how's this going down?
[01:32:12] Yeah, I mean, it's funny and listening to you talk it.
[01:32:15] It's all about this whole thing that we're doing,
[01:32:19] not trying to do, we're doing it,
[01:32:21] we're executing something.
[01:32:23] It's all around people and community.
[01:32:27] Like it takes people, it takes knowledge,
[01:32:30] it takes equipment, it takes community.
[01:32:32] Like it's the same damn thing.
[01:32:34] We're trying to make stuff, you know?
[01:32:37] We're trying to not lose who we are.
[01:32:39] Cause if we do, I mean, I don't even wanna guess
[01:32:43] what happens for our kid's generation.
[01:32:45] And honestly, I was saying to somebody the other day,
[01:32:48] it's on us right now.
[01:32:50] It's on the Gen Xers.
[01:32:52] I mean, us three at this table, it's on us.
[01:32:55] We're the next leaders of this nation.
[01:32:58] We're the business men and women of this nation.
[01:33:02] We're gonna drive the direction.
[01:33:04] We're gonna drive a divide,
[01:33:06] or we're gonna try to unify.
[01:33:09] You know, and I was explaining these market dynamics,
[01:33:14] actually to Kip and the team that,
[01:33:19] like what are we trying to do?
[01:33:22] And I'll try not to get off on a tangent here,
[01:33:24] but you have the greatest generation.
[01:33:27] The greatest generation were responsible
[01:33:31] for turning on the war machine of World War II,
[01:33:34] America's war machine, which was America's factories.
[01:33:37] We had the capabilities, we had the knowledge,
[01:33:40] we knew how to build tooling if we didn't have it.
[01:33:43] We knew how to make machines from scratch, from ore,
[01:33:47] from iron ore.
[01:33:48] We would freaking heat and cast and mold
[01:33:52] and pound that shit into shape
[01:33:54] until it turned into a tank or a truck, whatever we needed.
[01:33:58] And we truly have lost that.
[01:34:01] And it's been crushing the middle class, you know?
[01:34:04] And this is all about trying to give the middle class
[01:34:08] what makes America great, which is real opportunity.
[01:34:13] Because without it, who are we?
[01:34:17] I guess it's just a 250 year seizure, you know?
[01:34:21] And we're trying to do something about it.
[01:34:24] So I guess my point is is,
[01:34:29] we've kept this singleness of purpose across the board
[01:34:33] on origin and on jockel fuel.
[01:34:35] And although one serves the things you wear and need
[01:34:39] and use in life, the other one actually serves, you know,
[01:34:42] the things you need for nutrition
[01:34:44] and you need to consume this stuff.
[01:34:47] I was in Europe a couple weeks ago,
[01:34:49] there's foods that are illegal that are made here.
[01:34:52] You can't buy shit in Europe.
[01:34:55] Like stuff that comes in boxes that has its
[01:34:59] at the end of it and cheese at the beginning.
[01:35:01] You know, like that type of stuff
[01:35:03] that you want to consume by the handfuls.
[01:35:05] But you know, like we're like the things
[01:35:07] that these big conglomerates are able to make, you know?
[01:35:11] Like they're just not good for you.
[01:35:13] And we're trying to make something that's good for you.
[01:35:18] So this market dynamic of this World War II generation
[01:35:24] that is all but gone, that passed the stories
[01:35:27] on to us Gen Xers, these were the future leaders.
[01:35:31] Our kids have never, I don't want to say
[01:35:34] have never had any authentic experiences,
[01:35:36] but most of their experiences come through a device.
[01:35:39] Likes, follows, friends through this device.
[01:35:44] They didn't hear the stories
[01:35:46] from the greatest generation directly.
[01:35:48] So they lie with us.
[01:35:51] They've never really experienced anything authentic.
[01:35:54] They've never walked into a factory.
[01:35:57] And so you have this void of,
[01:36:01] I don't want to use the word authenticity,
[01:36:03] but you have this void of reality
[01:36:06] because everything is behind a screen.
[01:36:09] You can't see it truly.
[01:36:12] You can't smell it really.
[01:36:14] You can't feel it.
[01:36:16] And ultimately you don't know who made it.
[01:36:19] And there's something missing.
[01:36:23] The thing that's missing is what they fought for, right?
[01:36:27] It's what the greatest generation fought for.
[01:36:28] It's what they went to war for
[01:36:30] to protect the things we had.
[01:36:32] And then we sell those things to the lowest bidder.
[01:36:36] That's what we did.
[01:36:36] We sold it to the lowest bidder, but we let it happen.
[01:36:40] And origin and jockel fuel,
[01:36:45] like the things we're doing,
[01:36:47] it sits in the middle of this triangle
[01:36:49] where our kids are gonna experience something authentic
[01:36:54] for the first time.
[01:36:55] They're gonna walk into a factory and go,
[01:36:57] whoa, whoa, what is this?
[01:37:02] And they're gonna pick up a boot and smell the leather.
[01:37:07] So we're gonna leverage this technology
[01:37:09] they're used to to tell a different story,
[01:37:11] to write a different script, to change the narrative.
[01:37:13] And that's the idea here.
[01:37:15] And use and not romanticize about the greatest generation,
[01:37:22] but honor them through what we're doing.
[01:37:26] And that's the ultimate goal.
[01:37:28] Like when you look at this immersion camp,
[01:37:30] we're here in this immersion camp right now.
[01:37:32] You got 350 people here
[01:37:34] and we're walking through the factory yesterday.
[01:37:36] And for the first time, 70% of the people here
[01:37:39] have never been here.
[01:37:40] They've never been to the factory.
[01:37:42] The looks on their faces and the questions
[01:37:44] they're asking, I mean, we spent four hours
[01:37:47] walking through the factories.
[01:37:49] And they're just like, wow.
[01:37:51] And I know you've had a ton of people come up to you
[01:37:53] and I've had a ton of people come up to me,
[01:37:55] but we're not selling them anything.
[01:37:59] We're showing them a way to do something.
[01:38:03] They manifest what their belief in what we're doing
[01:38:06] and their alignment with what we're doing.
[01:38:08] They manifest that by purchasing a hoodie or a pair of jeans
[01:38:11] or a boots or grabbing a mocha or a goat.
[01:38:13] But they're living into the same thing we're leaning into.
[01:38:18] And I think that that's what makes it so not powerful.
[01:38:24] It's what makes it so important.
[01:38:27] It's why Wally sold us that factory.
[01:38:32] That's what he saw.
[01:38:33] He saw a generation that actually could do what he did
[01:38:37] because he didn't believe it was gonna happen.
[01:38:40] He thought we were too soft, soft and weak.
[01:38:43] So there's a mindset.
[01:38:48] There's an air, there's a frequency
[01:38:54] that we're all working on to try to make this shit happen.
[01:38:58] And it all is living as ideas
[01:39:03] in wanting to be executed,
[01:39:07] but sometimes recklessly.
[01:39:11] And we're trying to organize that
[01:39:13] so that it's executed more refined, I guess you could say.
[01:39:20] Whether it's with the jeans,
[01:39:22] whether it's with trying to make Moch RTDs.
[01:39:26] And it sounds silly a little bit for me to say it like that,
[01:39:29] but it's not because that shit is hard to make.
[01:39:32] There's five people in America who can make it
[01:39:34] that we know of.
[01:39:35] We're looking for more.
[01:39:37] Hey, listen, if you can make this Moch RTD for us
[01:39:40] in America, please let us know.
[01:39:42] Cause it's been difficult.
[01:39:44] What we wanted to do to keep it clean,
[01:39:46] you know, the way we needed to package it,
[01:39:50] aha, how we wanted to keep it actually good for you
[01:39:53] and healthy for you.
[01:39:54] There's actually not a lot of people who can do that.
[01:39:56] And the people who can,
[01:39:58] the people who can are held back by the big brands
[01:40:03] who have the market share and the control.
[01:40:06] And we're trying to come in and trying to take some
[01:40:12] of that market share and take some of that line time.
[01:40:15] And those big brands pay them off to not let us in
[01:40:19] or anyone like us in.
[01:40:21] They're not going to let us in.
[01:40:23] They ain't letting us on the line.
[01:40:25] They're not giving up an ounce of market share to us.
[01:40:30] Good thing we're fighters.
[01:40:32] You know what I mean?
[01:40:33] Like a little bit of savages, a little bit arrogant
[01:40:36] at times, but uncompromising.
[01:40:39] So, you know, we're in that process right now.
[01:40:42] I mean, we can't make what we need to make for the supply.
[01:40:45] We can make a certain amount.
[01:40:47] You know, like we have the product, we've had it.
[01:40:50] Our first manufacturer who committed to us then dropped us.
[01:40:53] I'm sure they got a side deal meal,
[01:40:55] some type of check cut to keep us out of the line.
[01:40:57] I'm not sure.
[01:40:58] Just shut, keep the line shut.
[01:40:59] Yeah.
[01:41:00] Just don't make anything.
[01:41:01] They're paying them not.
[01:41:02] They either are going to make them
[01:41:04] or they're not going to make anybody else.
[01:41:05] And these companies are getting paid off to do that.
[01:41:08] Not to make anything.
[01:41:08] Not to make anything.
[01:41:12] Just to go back to your tangent about making things
[01:41:16] and what it's like to see that.
[01:41:18] I think there's a certain human instinct that we have
[01:41:22] that a certain dopamine reward that we get
[01:41:24] for creating things, right?
[01:41:25] Otherwise, how would we be here?
[01:41:26] How would we as human beings have lasted
[01:41:29] if we didn't get a little dopamine hit
[01:41:31] from building a freaking roof over our head with sticks
[01:41:36] or put rocks into a circle and make a fire?
[01:41:39] If you didn't get some kind of dopamine hit from that,
[01:41:43] we wouldn't exist as human beings.
[01:41:45] So I think we all have that.
[01:41:46] And if anybody's ever, if you've ever created anything,
[01:41:49] if you've ever made anything,
[01:41:51] you get that little dopamine hit.
[01:41:52] Oh yeah.
[01:41:53] If you've, when you were a little kid
[01:41:54] and you made a tree fort, you enjoyed that.
[01:41:58] As you get older, you remodel the kitchen.
[01:42:00] If you did that, you hung drywall.
[01:42:03] At the end of the day, you looked up,
[01:42:03] you got a dopamine hit.
[01:42:05] I remember one time I was building a retaining wall
[01:42:06] in my backyard.
[01:42:07] I was in the Navy.
[01:42:08] I was probably, but I was like, probably,
[01:42:11] I guess I was 16, 17 years in the Navy.
[01:42:15] And I had taken a three day weekend
[01:42:18] so I could build a retaining wall.
[01:42:20] I'm out there laying bricks, laying block.
[01:42:23] And I got done and I just came in and I said,
[01:42:26] hey babe, I think when I retire, I'm gonna become a Mason.
[01:42:29] You know, like no one's bothering me.
[01:42:32] I'm listening to some music.
[01:42:34] The block don't talk.
[01:42:36] It's the block isn't gonna die.
[01:42:37] It's not even gonna get injured.
[01:42:40] And look what I did today.
[01:42:42] You know, like it's a good feeling.
[01:42:44] That dopamine hit is a real thing.
[01:42:46] And unfortunately, the dopamine hit is subsidized
[01:42:51] by clicking, you know, deliver this to my house.
[01:42:56] And it seems like they don't even want you to understand
[01:43:00] where this stuff came from.
[01:43:01] They just want you to get the dopamine hit
[01:43:02] of hitting add to cart.
[01:43:05] Yes. Right?
[01:43:06] They don't want you to know what it feels like
[01:43:07] to make this stuff.
[01:43:08] And you rip that out.
[01:43:09] That's why you see, you know, for years now, for kids,
[01:43:13] it's been, oh, you know what you need to do is,
[01:43:16] you need to go to college and learn, you know,
[01:43:20] you need to learn computer science or liberal arts.
[01:43:23] But you're not gonna go to a technical school.
[01:43:27] We don't want you to go to a technical school.
[01:43:28] We don't want you to be an electrician.
[01:43:29] We don't want you to be a plumber.
[01:43:31] We don't want you to be a mason.
[01:43:32] We don't want you to be a carpenter.
[01:43:33] We don't want you to know how to work a loom.
[01:43:35] We want, but we want you to buy this stuff.
[01:43:39] So there's like a capitalization of dopamine
[01:43:44] and they make it easier.
[01:43:45] And you know, even like, you know,
[01:43:47] you throughout computer science,
[01:43:48] actually people that do good computer science
[01:43:51] and computer engineering, they get dopamine hits
[01:43:54] cause they're building something.
[01:43:55] And it's something that they can make.
[01:43:57] I can tell you get dopamine when you make a video
[01:44:00] and it's good, you even make a part of a video sometime
[01:44:02] and you're like, hey, I built this
[01:44:05] and there's a certain amount of satisfaction.
[01:44:06] And like, that's a certain amount.
[01:44:08] That's something that I don't understand.
[01:44:09] I can't make anything on a computer as you know, right?
[01:44:12] Yes, we don't.
[01:44:13] But I know that you get it from there
[01:44:16] and I get to go straight to the source on that.
[01:44:18] So this is what happens, I think, you know, it's like,
[01:44:24] look, I'm not gonna sit here and say
[01:44:25] it's a conspiracy theory or a conspiracy
[01:44:28] that you know, the big corporations don't want people
[01:44:30] to make things on their own.
[01:44:32] But that's just the way it's turned out.
[01:44:34] The way it's turned out is, is if you wanna make,
[01:44:38] for instance, a ready to drink protein,
[01:44:41] they don't want you to know how good that feels
[01:44:44] to deliver that product and have people
[01:44:46] have a healthy choice when they go out.
[01:44:48] They don't want you to feel that.
[01:44:50] Because if you feel that, other people might feel it.
[01:44:52] And if other people might feel it,
[01:44:53] all of a sudden we got a problem on our hands.
[01:44:56] Dude, 100%.
[01:44:58] It's like freaking Soil and Green.
[01:45:00] The way this shit works.
[01:45:01] Remember that movie?
[01:45:02] Yeah.
[01:45:03] They're lining up to eat the wafers, man.
[01:45:05] Everybody's lining up to eat the wafers
[01:45:06] and we're like the insurgency, right?
[01:45:09] Saying, hey, join us.
[01:45:12] There's a better way.
[01:45:14] Here's the truth, we gotta have truth.
[01:45:19] Yeah.
[01:45:20] Gotta have truth, so.
[01:45:22] So we, so through great effort,
[01:45:25] we eventually, we find a manufacturer in Canada.
[01:45:28] Yeah, seven hours away.
[01:45:30] Our neighbors in Toronto.
[01:45:31] Our neighbors, God bless.
[01:45:35] And they're up there and they're, you know, not,
[01:45:37] they're not willing to sit back
[01:45:39] and shut down their line for money.
[01:45:42] Right.
[01:45:42] We're gonna have things made.
[01:45:44] Good on them.
[01:45:45] So the malt comes, here's another, you know,
[01:45:48] just another, the flavors on the go, right?
[01:45:52] So we got discipline go.
[01:45:53] When did the first one come out?
[01:45:55] A year ago?
[01:45:57] Two years ago?
[01:45:58] Was it two years ago?
[01:45:58] The new, the new adjusted.
[01:45:59] No, when's the very first discipline go?
[01:46:02] Who can remember?
[01:46:03] So a couple years ago.
[01:46:04] We have one flavor, it comes out.
[01:46:06] It's based on my taste buds, which is a bad idea.
[01:46:09] I don't drink sugar.
[01:46:11] I don't eat sugar.
[01:46:13] Or let me rephrase it.
[01:46:14] I don't drink a lot.
[01:46:15] I haven't drank in a Coca-Cola in decades, right?
[01:46:18] So the very first Jocco discipline go that I had,
[01:46:22] which had a little bit of monk fruit in it,
[01:46:24] it to me, it tasted like friggin, you know,
[01:46:26] candy cane almost, right?
[01:46:27] I'm like, oh, hell yeah, this is sweet.
[01:46:29] Hell yeah.
[01:46:30] And that's sort of the baseline that we used
[01:46:33] in the beginning for the drink.
[01:46:35] And the bottom line is it was to use Echo's term
[01:46:40] and Echo's correct.
[01:46:41] He's like, you're not normal, meaning Jocco,
[01:46:43] you're not normal.
[01:46:44] And he's right, my taste buds are not normal.
[01:46:47] And so we ended up, as we developed the flavors
[01:46:51] for the discipline go, look, we made the best possible drink.
[01:46:55] The efforts that we went through to make it,
[01:46:58] how we made it, to make it as clean and make it as natural,
[01:47:02] to hold off on making it for seven or eight months
[01:47:04] so we could actually pasteurize it instead of just,
[01:47:06] hey, you know what, why don't you just throw
[01:47:07] some chemicals in there?
[01:47:09] Just throw them in there.
[01:47:09] It'll be okay.
[01:47:10] No, we're not gonna do that.
[01:47:11] We're gonna pasteurize it.
[01:47:13] What about, hey, monk food's kind of expensive.
[01:47:16] We can throw some of the aspartame, we can do that?
[01:47:20] Hey, no one will really know.
[01:47:21] Yes, we know, I know.
[01:47:23] We're not doing it.
[01:47:24] We're gonna hold the line.
[01:47:25] So we make, well, you should just dump a bunch of caffeine
[01:47:28] that way people will feel it.
[01:47:29] Yeah, then they're gonna crash too
[01:47:30] and it's not good, it's a freaking bad form.
[01:47:32] We're not doing it.
[01:47:34] So we end up making an outstanding drink
[01:47:37] in terms of performance.
[01:47:39] But taste, not the best.
[01:47:42] You definitely need it to get better.
[01:47:45] So we had to attack that issue.
[01:47:47] Man, I got really happy.
[01:47:49] I got really used to the taste, by the way.
[01:47:51] Yeah, so did I.
[01:47:51] And I was like, I like, it's like,
[01:47:53] if you drink coffee for the first time,
[01:47:56] of course this is a thousand times better than coffee.
[01:47:59] Dude, I don't drink coffee.
[01:48:01] I did a spurt of five years.
[01:48:02] I drank coffee in the beginning of Starting Origin.
[01:48:05] I don't drink coffee though.
[01:48:06] And then I never drank before
[01:48:07] because I think coffee is disgusting.
[01:48:10] I think it tastes bad.
[01:48:11] I think it tastes really good
[01:48:12] with a lot of sugar cubes and some milk
[01:48:14] and maybe throw some whipped cream in there.
[01:48:17] But that's not really coffee, you know what I'm saying?
[01:48:19] So I really did like, and I actually drank mango,
[01:48:24] is I drink a mango every day.
[01:48:26] One can of mango every morning.
[01:48:28] That was my best part of waking up,
[01:48:30] was mango in my mouth, you know what I'm saying?
[01:48:32] And I love the iced tea lemonade.
[01:48:35] And that's what, so the old flavors were like this.
[01:48:38] Usually people had one that they really liked.
[01:48:41] Yes, I had one.
[01:48:42] And they had two that they thought were okay.
[01:48:44] And they had three that they literally didn't like at all,
[01:48:47] which is not good, right?
[01:48:49] So we knew we had to redo these flavors.
[01:48:52] And what we ended up having to do is say,
[01:48:55] hey, you know what, we need help.
[01:48:57] We need help.
[01:48:58] We've reached the maximum capacity of our capabilities
[01:49:03] and reached out to professionals
[01:49:06] that actually formulate flavors
[01:49:08] and can help and help us put together
[01:49:12] and reformulate the flavors on all the drinks.
[01:49:15] And man, what a freaking difference.
[01:49:19] I mean, the new flavors, all of them.
[01:49:22] This is what it's like now.
[01:49:23] You'll have three that you love
[01:49:26] and you'll have four that you absolutely love almost as much.
[01:49:31] I actually drink every single flavor.
[01:49:34] They're all delicious now.
[01:49:36] They're all delicious now.
[01:49:37] So that was huge, but...
[01:49:41] We had to destroy some flavors as well.
[01:49:43] This is what's crazy, right?
[01:49:44] It's not like you snap your fingers
[01:49:46] and now you have new flavors.
[01:49:47] No, this is a massive investment financially
[01:49:50] to bring these new flavors around.
[01:49:52] The testing, the, hey, no, this one sucks.
[01:49:55] No, I want a little sweeter, less lime,
[01:49:57] you know, more cherries.
[01:49:59] All these things going back and forth,
[01:50:02] paying to get all these things formulated.
[01:50:05] And then once you get them formulated,
[01:50:06] well, now you've got to adjust
[01:50:09] all the cans that you've made.
[01:50:11] And you've got some cans that are sitting around
[01:50:13] that now what are we gonna do with these?
[01:50:14] So this was a massive effort, a massive effort.
[01:50:20] But, you know what, I remember the,
[01:50:23] I don't want to say the dictum that I put out.
[01:50:27] Like the commander's intent that I put out was,
[01:50:34] we need to win on taste.
[01:50:36] Like, look, we're winning on everything else.
[01:50:38] Everything else.
[01:50:39] We've got everyone else crushed.
[01:50:41] We've got them.
[01:50:42] No one can touch us.
[01:50:44] We need to win on taste.
[01:50:45] If it doesn't taste good, it doesn't matter.
[01:50:48] And we did it.
[01:50:49] We did it now.
[01:50:50] We're winning on taste.
[01:50:51] So now we're winning.
[01:50:52] We got the best tasting.
[01:50:54] We got the most efficient.
[01:50:55] And now that means that right there
[01:50:59] was the production of all the weapons right there.
[01:51:02] That was the production of all the weapons
[01:51:04] and all the battleships and all the aircraft carriers
[01:51:06] and all the airplanes
[01:51:07] and all the howitzers in World War II.
[01:51:09] We made this.
[01:51:10] And now they're out.
[01:51:11] Now it's time to take them into battle.
[01:51:14] And this is such a fascinating world.
[01:51:19] This battle that goes on in the business world.
[01:51:22] And I never knew about it.
[01:51:24] I mean, I certainly didn't know about this three,
[01:51:26] four years ago.
[01:51:28] What's going on when you go into stores?
[01:51:31] How that functions?
[01:51:33] So you go into a store, you go into a convenience store.
[01:51:37] And you see 20 different energy drinks
[01:51:42] in the cooler, in the refrigerator.
[01:51:45] And those energy drinks to get into that cooler
[01:51:50] had to fight to get in there.
[01:51:52] And what that means is they in many cases
[01:51:55] had to pay to get in there.
[01:51:56] They had to pay millions of dollars to get that shelf space.
[01:52:01] And each one of those different brands
[01:52:04] that you're looking at in there,
[01:52:06] some of them have paid more,
[01:52:07] some of them have paid less.
[01:52:09] If you happen to have a drink that just performs great,
[01:52:16] guess what?
[01:52:16] They don't have to pay a bunch to get in there.
[01:52:19] If you have something like Jocko Fuel where we do perform,
[01:52:24] we haven't paid to get in there.
[01:52:28] Yes.
[01:52:28] We're getting by on actual performance.
[01:52:32] And that's good because the amount of money
[01:52:35] that gets thrown around in these deals,
[01:52:37] we're talking about billion dollar companies,
[01:52:40] multi-billion dollar companies.
[01:52:42] So you got that war going on.
[01:52:44] So that every space in that shelf
[01:52:49] is fought for.
[01:52:50] And you know what?
[01:52:51] When you go in and you support,
[01:52:53] you go in and you buy a Jocko Go from a convenience store,
[01:52:56] you go into a grocery store and you buy it,
[01:52:57] you are, you're calling for reinforcements.
[01:53:01] You're opening up the gates for reinforcements
[01:53:04] to get in there.
[01:53:05] So when you do that, thank you for doing that.
[01:53:07] Not only are you supporting yourself,
[01:53:09] you're supporting the company,
[01:53:12] which means you're supporting America.
[01:53:13] So thank you for doing that.
[01:53:14] So you got that war going on one front.
[01:53:16] The other war is this virtual war
[01:53:18] that you've got going on, which is insane.
[01:53:21] So whether it's search words on Google
[01:53:27] or searching in Amazon, see this is again,
[01:53:30] bro they don't call it conquest for no reason.
[01:53:33] There's term conquest.
[01:53:35] You conquest somebody.
[01:53:36] This is a war term.
[01:53:37] This is where I started to understand
[01:53:39] what was happening on Amazon.
[01:53:42] You know, years ago, I'm at Ashlam Front
[01:53:44] and I like certain kinds of pens
[01:53:46] as stupid as that might sound.
[01:53:48] You know I'm kind of a particular guy, I'll go Charles.
[01:53:49] I like things a certain way, right?
[01:53:51] There's one right there.
[01:53:53] I like certain kinds of pens.
[01:53:55] I like certain types of pencils.
[01:53:57] I like certain types of paper.
[01:54:00] So, you know, one time I was like ordering one of my pens.
[01:54:03] This is, and I ain't no freaking Mont Blanc dude over here.
[01:54:07] I'm not rolling on a $200 pen or whatever.
[01:54:10] I like pens that cost $2.59.
[01:54:12] So I order one pen for $2.59.
[01:54:16] And Amazon says, yep, it'll be there tomorrow at your house.
[01:54:21] So I'm thinking to myself, that's crazy.
[01:54:24] I don't know how they're doing this.
[01:54:25] It's gotta cost them.
[01:54:29] How much does it cost for them to deliver
[01:54:30] this thing to my house?
[01:54:31] A lot more than $2.59.
[01:54:32] A lot more than $2.59.
[01:54:33] And what's their profit margin on $2.59 or $2.39?
[01:54:39] What is it, $2.20?
[01:54:41] It costs them $2 to get this thing to my door
[01:54:43] at an absolute minimum.
[01:54:45] So how in God's name are they making money?
[01:54:47] How is that happening?
[01:54:49] Well, when I searched pen,
[01:54:53] there's 12 pens that come up
[01:54:56] and each one of them is paying to pop up on my computer screen
[01:55:00] and lure me into buying them.
[01:55:03] And that's happening billions of times a day.
[01:55:06] So there's this virtual war going on inside of Amazon.
[01:55:11] And it was crazy as we put our products on Amazon
[01:55:17] that if you searched Jocko protein,
[01:55:23] before we understood the battlefield,
[01:55:25] you'd search Jocko protein
[01:55:26] and there would be nine proteins come up,
[01:55:29] none of which would be Jocko fuel.
[01:55:32] Or you'd search krill oil
[01:55:34] and seven krill oils would pop up
[01:55:36] and none of them would be Jocko fuel.
[01:55:39] And this confused me for about four hours.
[01:55:42] And then I said, hey, what in God's name is going on?
[01:55:45] And guess what, people are paying.
[01:55:46] And the word you just use is conquest.
[01:55:49] Explain that, explain how that works.
[01:55:51] I mean, we like to do it every now and then.
[01:55:54] I mean, you gotta fight fire with fire a little bit,
[01:55:58] but learning the landscape first of all
[01:56:01] in obviously getting smart people involved
[01:56:04] was key to our hiring process of getting,
[01:56:06] I call it expanding the brain trust,
[01:56:08] you know what I mean?
[01:56:10] Basically it works like this.
[01:56:13] You find smarter people and you algorithmically bid.
[01:56:20] So if you have AI, that's even better
[01:56:22] against your competitors
[01:56:24] and then you conquest them by using their name.
[01:56:27] So regardless if they're searching for you or searching
[01:56:31] or using their brand name, you're coming up.
[01:56:33] And that's the war, that's the war online.
[01:56:36] 100% and it's no different than in the stores
[01:56:39] except that the companies, and we're in this war right now,
[01:56:43] we're in this war in the store right now.
[01:56:46] We have a company that is offering millions of dollars
[01:56:52] for shelf space, which we need.
[01:56:59] We can't fight that battle.
[01:57:01] So we're working on some other techniques
[01:57:03] which we won't share to flank it and stay
[01:57:06] where we need to stay ultimately
[01:57:08] and continue driving velocity to prove out what we're doing,
[01:57:13] not just to the store, but to the consumer also.
[01:57:15] So there's a lot of moving parts there.
[01:57:17] Yeah, and the best thing, so here's a,
[01:57:21] people talk to me for it in a bunch of books, right?
[01:57:23] And people are like, oh, you know what's the key
[01:57:25] to making New York Times bestseller?
[01:57:27] What's the key to having a bestselling book?
[01:57:29] And the key is write a good book.
[01:57:32] That's the actual key.
[01:57:33] So the best thing that we can do is what we've done,
[01:57:36] make the best possible product,
[01:57:38] make it taste as good as it possibly can.
[01:57:40] And that is why we're in there in the first place.
[01:57:43] We don't have the firepower to break through the door.
[01:57:50] What gets us into all these different places
[01:57:52] is the high demand signal.
[01:57:53] So thank you all out there right now,
[01:57:55] tuning in, listening going, hell yeah.
[01:57:57] Clear the shelves.
[01:57:58] Yes, clear the shelves.
[01:57:59] You out there, clear the shelves.
[01:58:00] That's literally what made this happen.
[01:58:03] That's what keeps us going.
[01:58:05] The product, the effectiveness of the product,
[01:58:08] the taste of the product,
[01:58:09] that's the number one weapon to make this happen.
[01:58:14] But, and that's what we have to use,
[01:58:17] is because that's what we have.
[01:58:18] We don't have billions of dollars.
[01:58:20] We can't throw tens of millions of dollars at a store
[01:58:24] to say, can you give us a few more,
[01:58:26] can you get rid of our competitor?
[01:58:28] Because that's what happens.
[01:58:29] And look, this is business.
[01:58:31] This is business.
[01:58:32] I get it and they can win.
[01:58:35] I get that too.
[01:58:36] You can understand Wally a little bit.
[01:58:38] You can understand Wally's mindset
[01:58:40] with his, that protective mindset.
[01:58:41] We're doing the same thing.
[01:58:43] You know, we're going to buy line time.
[01:58:45] We're going to go buy, we're in the process of it.
[01:58:48] We just secured 2025 line time for Moq RTDs.
[01:58:51] 2025, shit ain't even set up yet.
[01:58:54] And we're going to own that.
[01:58:56] Why?
[01:58:57] Because you got to be a savage about it.
[01:58:58] You got to protect what you're building.
[01:59:00] So it is, it helps me understand his mindset
[01:59:04] by our mindset with how we're building this.
[01:59:07] Yep.
[01:59:08] And you have to, like you just said,
[01:59:10] you have to be a savage because if you're not,
[01:59:14] you have to be a predator.
[01:59:15] You have to go, you have to be a predator
[01:59:18] because otherwise you'll get eaten.
[01:59:19] You just look like prey.
[01:59:20] And in these big companies, it's us down here,
[01:59:25] you know, scrapping.
[01:59:27] And they can just, you know, they can throw money at stuff.
[01:59:30] And you know what?
[01:59:31] And like I said, they can win.
[01:59:33] That's the way things work.
[01:59:35] But we also have advantages.
[01:59:38] And that's what we're going to utilize.
[01:59:39] You know, this is how insurgencies work.
[01:59:42] How do small little gorillas running around in the jungle
[01:59:46] defeat giant imperialist countries?
[01:59:49] It's an insurgency.
[01:59:51] There's belief.
[01:59:52] There's belief in what's happening.
[01:59:54] There's unity in the people.
[01:59:58] That's what we have.
[01:59:59] We have people that believe we have unity
[02:00:01] and that's our strength.
[02:00:02] And that's how we're going to win on that battlefield.
[02:00:06] Now, meanwhile, again, while all this is going on,
[02:00:11] which is a daily fight, a daily fight.
[02:00:15] Meanwhile, we got this double merger going on.
[02:00:17] And it's actually more of like a triple.
[02:00:20] We have a triple merger going on
[02:00:23] because now in North Carolina, what we end up with is
[02:00:27] we have factory one that we bought.
[02:00:30] Now we have, and it's not like factory one was bought
[02:00:33] and now everyone, we've been there for long enough.
[02:00:35] Now everyone's completely transitioned
[02:00:37] into everyone understands what we're doing
[02:00:39] and everyone's on board with the way our leadership works.
[02:00:43] No, that's still going on.
[02:00:45] Boom, now we buy another factory.
[02:00:48] And now we have the origin culture, factory one
[02:00:51] and factory two, all these cultures merging in one shot
[02:00:58] at one time.
[02:00:59] What's that looking like?
[02:01:00] Well, don't forget and maybe you want to save this,
[02:01:04] but while all this is going on,
[02:01:06] we have this kind of aggressive and bold idea
[02:01:10] of building an American made hunt line in this factory
[02:01:14] that we're going to double merge together.
[02:01:17] So I don't know if that's crazy.
[02:01:21] It's a little bit crazy.
[02:01:24] What we're trying to do is you're not right in the head.
[02:01:29] I think that's what makes it all work
[02:01:31] is other companies, they're not willing to pull out all stops.
[02:01:39] It's not normal.
[02:01:44] It's necessary though, like you said.
[02:01:46] So double merger, trying to build culture
[02:01:50] at the same time, developing textiles, developing a camo,
[02:01:55] trying to get this wash house up so we can wash jeans,
[02:01:59] developing new fits, hiring a product team,
[02:02:01] getting the logistics figure out,
[02:02:03] building out a new direct to consumer warehouse,
[02:02:05] training people on that, hiring operators,
[02:02:09] like hiring new C level executives,
[02:02:12] having to have board meetings, expanding the finance team.
[02:02:16] It's a lot.
[02:02:17] It's a big ass wave, man.
[02:02:20] I'm just like, and honestly from my perspective.
[02:02:25] These monsters went from like Komodo dragons to Godzilla.
[02:02:29] Yeah, 100% freaking weird.
[02:02:31] Somebody said to me recently, man, you're hard work guys.
[02:02:35] Actually, I will not outwork you.
[02:02:38] I will out ADHD you.
[02:02:41] That's it.
[02:02:42] I got ADHD for days, man.
[02:02:46] Like I can bounce around, but it gets to a point
[02:02:48] where like you got to organize the chaos.
[02:02:51] And you can use your ADHD, I can use it as a superpower,
[02:02:58] but stepping back and like, hey,
[02:03:01] letting people start to organize this chaos
[02:03:05] into a machine.
[02:03:06] It's like you got all these parts and pieces,
[02:03:09] but like putting them together, dumping some oil,
[02:03:12] putting the grease on and tuning it in and letting it run.
[02:03:16] It's kind of where we're at right now is it's together,
[02:03:22] but it's squeaking, man.
[02:03:23] It's squeaking and we know what needs to be done,
[02:03:27] but the biggest part of that is culture.
[02:03:29] And honestly, it's on both sides of this two-headed monster.
[02:03:34] Is keeping that consistent culture, driving it down.
[02:03:37] I believe the most important thing you can have
[02:03:39] in business is culture.
[02:03:41] I think if you have good culture, you can do anything.
[02:03:44] And we've seen that in a positive light and war,
[02:03:46] and we've seen that in a very negative light and war.
[02:03:50] If you can get buy-in from the people
[02:03:53] and you can create a mission and a mindset around that mission
[02:03:59] that people are willing to execute against
[02:04:01] and go to war for, you can truly do anything.
[02:04:06] You truly can do anything.
[02:04:08] I've always believed that as a kid,
[02:04:10] when they said you can be anything you wanna be.
[02:04:11] You can do anything in life.
[02:04:12] I actually believed that shit.
[02:04:14] Maybe I was naive, but I believed it.
[02:04:16] You know what I'm saying?
[02:04:17] And I still do believe it.
[02:04:18] So, I remember calling you up and being like,
[02:04:23] and we don't need to share it here,
[02:04:25] but like, hey, Jocko, we've got some problems.
[02:04:28] We've got some problems trying to merge this thing together.
[02:04:31] I shared some of those concerns with you
[02:04:34] of that mindset from the 70s and 80s
[02:04:38] that was really not gonna work and really not okay.
[02:04:45] And at that point, obviously, you were like,
[02:04:48] yeah, I'm freaking in, you know,
[02:04:51] and getting the teams together,
[02:04:53] feeding them, having a meal,
[02:04:55] and then like showing them and going to town
[02:04:58] on like who we are and what we're all about
[02:05:01] and what culture means and what leadership means
[02:05:03] and how to lead and how to communicate.
[02:05:06] Like it's not like, and I know you've been down twice now
[02:05:11] for the whole team, then for the management team.
[02:05:13] I believe it's gonna take like some people going to Musters,
[02:05:18] some of you coming back to the factory,
[02:05:21] you know, like it's gonna take this constant alignment
[02:05:23] over the course of 24 months.
[02:05:26] That's how long the double merger is gonna take.
[02:05:28] Yeah, yeah, and that's pretty standard, right?
[02:05:32] I don't know, man.
[02:05:32] You tell me, I mean, your business is all the time.
[02:05:34] I don't know.
[02:05:35] I am telling you, yeah.
[02:05:36] I'm with the trenches a little bit.
[02:05:38] It's not an oculation.
[02:05:39] You don't go to a one-no,
[02:05:40] Jocke would talk about extreme ownership,
[02:05:41] okay, cool, now I get it, now we can move on.
[02:05:43] This doesn't work like that.
[02:05:45] But what is beautiful is you can see progress.
[02:05:50] I mean, you mentioned about Jason's progress
[02:05:55] as his mind opened up,
[02:05:57] as he started to understand other ways to lead
[02:06:01] and get out of just a survival mode, which is a good thing,
[02:06:04] but it's not as good as a build and thrive
[02:06:08] and takeover mode, right?
[02:06:09] That's the thing.
[02:06:11] And just like a really simple thing.
[02:06:14] When I talked to the team in North Carolina,
[02:06:17] just explaining to them that leadership wanted their feedback.
[02:06:25] Leadership wanted their feedback.
[02:06:26] Leadership wanted to know if there was something
[02:06:29] on the line that didn't make sense.
[02:06:30] And I remember asking, you know,
[02:06:31] something along the lines of like,
[02:06:32] who here thinks Jason knows how to hem that thing
[02:06:37] better than the person that sits on the machine all day?
[02:06:39] Everyone's like, of course, the person on the machine.
[02:06:41] So if Jason's telling you to do something the wrong way,
[02:06:44] doesn't it make sense that you say,
[02:06:46] hey, this doesn't work or here's a better way to do it?
[02:06:48] Yes.
[02:06:49] And like the light on their faces was a beautiful thing to see
[02:06:54] because you can see that they do have ideas
[02:06:56] and they have better ways of doing things
[02:06:58] and they can definitely help us improve
[02:06:59] and they will help us and they are helping us improve.
[02:07:03] And of course, you still have to power through the fact
[02:07:05] that they've been underneath leadership
[02:07:07] that didn't do that for a long time.
[02:07:09] It was like, hey, you're gonna do what we say,
[02:07:10] we don't wanna hear from you.
[02:07:12] So this is where things start to change.
[02:07:14] And Jason says he getting that feedback that he needs.
[02:07:17] So no, there's not gonna be an overnight transition.
[02:07:19] That's not gonna happen.
[02:07:21] But what's beautiful is that transition is already happening.
[02:07:24] You already see the improvement.
[02:07:26] You already see the attitude.
[02:07:27] The difference between when I went down there the first time
[02:07:30] and I went down there the second time,
[02:07:32] a couple months apart, radically different.
[02:07:34] Radically different situation.
[02:07:35] You can see the difference on the floor.
[02:07:38] You can see the people smiling.
[02:07:40] You can see them looking, wanting to show me something,
[02:07:42] wanting me to look at this.
[02:07:43] So come and look, that's what you see.
[02:07:45] And that's just like, that's where we're going.
[02:07:48] That's the culture starting to grow.
[02:07:50] And the other thing is you can't impose culture, right?
[02:07:52] You can't say, okay, here's the new culture.
[02:07:54] A through Z.
[02:07:56] No, it has to all go into the pot.
[02:07:59] And we have to cook it together and they have to realize
[02:08:02] and there's gonna be some things
[02:08:03] that they're gonna give to us.
[02:08:05] And so that's the beautiful thing is to watch this thing.
[02:08:08] Watch that unfold.
[02:08:11] Huntline.
[02:08:13] So first of all, you being in Maine,
[02:08:17] being in the woods of Maine,
[02:08:20] hunting is a way of life up here.
[02:08:22] So a way of life, I know Joe, your father-in-law,
[02:08:26] he's a hunter, you're a hunter.
[02:08:28] I remember your son out running trap lines.
[02:08:31] Like this is the way of life in Maine.
[02:08:33] So for hunting, for you, it was like,
[02:08:35] oh yeah, this is a no-brainer.
[02:08:37] Yeah, I mean, a total no-brainer.
[02:08:39] And that community's also, they're also patriots
[02:08:43] and they heavily believe in the land.
[02:08:48] They heavily believe in America.
[02:08:50] And the fact that they don't have an option
[02:08:56] that is made here with textiles that were made here,
[02:09:01] like the fact that there's no option anymore.
[02:09:04] We actually, in my last company in the early 2000s,
[02:09:06] we actually manufactured, I mean,
[02:09:08] we did marketing for this company.
[02:09:10] It's called Beagle Ware and they did a wool.
[02:09:14] And I still wear that hunting.
[02:09:16] And I don't hunt a lot anymore
[02:09:18] because I'm trying to feed two monsters seven days a week.
[02:09:24] But I remember, that's what I still wear hunting right now
[02:09:26] is I wear this wool Beagle Ware, which has a DWR on it.
[02:09:30] Freakin' stuff is phenomenal.
[02:09:32] That for me was always like the pinnacle
[02:09:34] of hunting gear made in America, made in Vermont.
[02:09:39] To bring this to fruition and to bring a product
[02:09:41] at the level we've brought it to
[02:09:44] on an American supply chain is, it's a little bit
[02:09:51] of a miracle that we did it.
[02:09:54] And I'll tell you what, if we didn't have the team we did
[02:09:57] and the vision we had, and honestly with Kip involved
[02:10:00] and his knowledge base of building Under Armour
[02:10:04] and him keeping us away from making tuition payments,
[02:10:09] I don't think it would have happened without Kip.
[02:10:11] I don't.
[02:10:12] Well, yeah, it would not have, not even don't think.
[02:10:16] We would not have done it without Kip.
[02:10:18] Exactly, so a big advocate there
[02:10:21] and really driving how things should go.
[02:10:25] And it's been, for me, it's been a year of learning.
[02:10:28] Yeah, I'm kind of directing both organizations,
[02:10:33] both monsters, but he's been there really calling out,
[02:10:40] really calling it out in the Kip way.
[02:10:42] You know what I mean?
[02:10:43] Which is a little bit savage at times.
[02:10:46] I've just kind of kept my mouth shut and executed.
[02:10:48] So I've been, I feel like a little bit,
[02:10:50] I've been just working for him on the Hunt line.
[02:10:56] You know, I'm like working, I'm working for him.
[02:10:58] And I'm totally okay with that.
[02:11:00] Like that dude is, he's been driving this thing,
[02:11:04] but understanding his thought process
[02:11:08] of how to build product.
[02:11:10] And I'm not just talking about Hunt,
[02:11:12] but the thought process of how to build great product
[02:11:16] with innovation, how to think about supply chains
[02:11:19] and logistics, how to communicate with partners.
[02:11:24] You know, how to build relationships that are lasting,
[02:11:28] how to talk to consumers.
[02:11:32] I feel like I've had a college education
[02:11:37] over the past year.
[02:11:37] It's been freaking phenomenal.
[02:11:39] He's gonna hell a lot more than a college education.
[02:11:41] Because Kip has this experience that you just,
[02:11:44] you're just not, you can't, you could never,
[02:11:48] you can't learn what Kip knows.
[02:11:50] You can't learn that from a book or from a seminar
[02:11:54] or from a college course, like ever.
[02:11:56] You cannot learn what he knows.
[02:11:58] You have to have lived it.
[02:12:00] And I actually told him last week on the phone,
[02:12:04] I was like, man, you gotta get ahold of Jocko
[02:12:05] and you got it.
[02:12:06] Cause I've been trying to push him to like write a book
[02:12:09] under the armor, like and to tell the stories.
[02:12:12] And I'm like, Jocko can publish that shit, dude.
[02:12:13] Like, dude, call him and talk to him about it.
[02:12:16] But also like start a YouTube channel
[02:12:19] and Kip's a bit of a savage, you know what I mean?
[02:12:21] The way he talks, he's just different.
[02:12:24] He different.
[02:12:27] But a super positive influence
[02:12:30] on what we're doing as an organization.
[02:12:32] Building this hunt line wasn't easy.
[02:12:34] The Alpha Bravo Charlie layering system,
[02:12:36] the way we're using wool, you know,
[02:12:39] which is really core to who we are,
[02:12:41] is this natural fiber in our nano wool
[02:12:44] and our base layer and our stealth wool
[02:12:47] and mid layer.
[02:12:48] FYI, yeah.
[02:12:49] It's not your dad's wool.
[02:12:52] It's not your granddad's wool.
[02:12:53] No, it's a totally different kind of wool.
[02:12:55] Fine micron American marina wool to be exact.
[02:12:58] It doesn't feel like, well, I don't know,
[02:13:00] Echo, do you, how old are you, 44?
[02:13:03] Yes, sir.
[02:13:03] Oh yeah.
[02:13:04] Well, I was gonna ask you a question about wool
[02:13:05] and I remembered you're from Hawaii.
[02:13:07] That's true.
[02:13:09] You didn't wear anything wool growing up ever.
[02:13:13] No.
[02:13:13] Never.
[02:13:15] All right.
[02:13:15] You know, we didn't have our wool available yet
[02:13:18] for me to test and I had to go to Europe a few weeks ago
[02:13:22] and we were gonna go, actually,
[02:13:23] and then we went to Scotland.
[02:13:25] And so I bought a smart wool, you know that brand.
[02:13:28] I bought some socks.
[02:13:30] Dude.
[02:13:31] I wear those socks during like all temperatures.
[02:13:34] I didn't get it what like marina wool did
[02:13:38] to regulate your body.
[02:13:40] My feet don't sweat in it.
[02:13:42] It doesn't make sense.
[02:13:44] It doesn't make sense how this natural fiber
[02:13:47] that's so old can be used still very innovative.
[02:13:52] You know what I mean?
[02:13:53] Like it's an incredible fiber.
[02:13:55] So, you know, we leveraged this fine micron marina wool.
[02:14:01] We blended it.
[02:14:02] We produced these incredible textiles.
[02:14:04] We gleaned some of the knowledge from spec ops, you know,
[02:14:08] that hasn't been commercialized yet.
[02:14:11] And we put this incredible line together.
[02:14:13] Freakin' printed, roller printed, sublimated,
[02:14:17] acid printed, like badass textiles that we're cutting
[02:14:21] and sewing and turning into freaking America.
[02:14:24] America's first truly American made hunt line
[02:14:28] without compromise on the origin factory blockchain.
[02:14:30] There is not another company doing that.
[02:14:33] I'm giving you what anybody says.
[02:14:35] Yeah, there's something.
[02:14:36] When you mentioned the spec ops
[02:14:37] and military base of this year,
[02:14:39] there's something called Berry compliant.
[02:14:42] So Berry was a representative or something
[02:14:45] and he created a law where military had the deal,
[02:14:50] the defense department had to purchase stuff
[02:14:52] that was American made.
[02:14:54] And it includes a whole bunch of different things.
[02:14:56] You know, metal made products,
[02:14:58] but textiles and clothing is one of them.
[02:15:00] And it's probably the biggest category.
[02:15:03] And so these things exist.
[02:15:08] If it wasn't for that, honestly,
[02:15:09] this stuff probably wouldn't exist
[02:15:10] and we would have had to build a freaking mill
[02:15:12] because the mill, there wouldn't even be mills here.
[02:15:14] We would have probably had to build a mill
[02:15:15] and make the stuff ourselves.
[02:15:17] But luckily that did exist.
[02:15:19] So thank you, Representative Berry,
[02:15:22] for wherever you may be for putting that law into place
[02:15:24] because it kept some level of manufacturing here.
[02:15:27] So we were able to get a hold of that material
[02:15:30] and utilize that material.
[02:15:31] That's outstanding material.
[02:15:35] It's available, but it's hard.
[02:15:39] And where they get away with some of the stuff
[02:15:42] is like the Berry Laws,
[02:15:44] it says some exceptions are due to unavailability,
[02:15:47] cost or manufacturing efficiencies of US based products.
[02:15:50] So there's a claim that people can make,
[02:15:52] well, you know, we can't quite make that type of zipper.
[02:15:55] So we're gonna get it overseas.
[02:15:57] But we can't make this type of nylon.
[02:15:59] So we're gonna get it overseas.
[02:16:01] Or it's gonna cost too much.
[02:16:02] It's literally it costs too much.
[02:16:03] So we're gonna do it overseas.
[02:16:05] So there's ways that people get around it
[02:16:06] and they can still call it Berry compliant.
[02:16:09] We're better than Berry compliant.
[02:16:10] Better than Berry, and that's what we externally,
[02:16:13] like on our website,
[02:16:14] we have to say for the consumer something.
[02:16:17] So we say Berry compliant internally,
[02:16:20] we're better than Berry.
[02:16:22] Let me give you an example.
[02:16:24] You know, there's a company in Maine that makes boots.
[02:16:28] And their uppers, the full upper of the boot,
[02:16:33] which is the boot without the sole,
[02:16:35] comes in from Mexico and they call, they bottom it.
[02:16:39] That's what it's called bottoming.
[02:16:40] So they put a sole on it and they put laces in it.
[02:16:44] And it's American made.
[02:16:47] That technically is Berry compliant, right?
[02:16:51] Internally, we are better than Berry.
[02:16:54] That's a big deal to say that, hey man,
[02:16:58] when you buy a pair of boots, that sole,
[02:17:01] that came actually from Massachusetts,
[02:17:04] from Vibram, they injected it there.
[02:17:06] That leather came from Wisconsin.
[02:17:08] Those eyelids came from here.
[02:17:09] Like it all, like that poor on midsole on the jeans,
[02:17:12] that cotton was grown by a Texas.
[02:17:14] That rivet.
[02:17:15] That rivet, yeah exactly.
[02:17:17] That zipper, that thread.
[02:17:18] So better than Berry is what we stand by internally.
[02:17:21] And that's the only way that we continue
[02:17:26] building the limited supply chains
[02:17:28] and helping everybody, everybody that touches
[02:17:34] any part of that product, any component.
[02:17:37] That's how we rebuild the communities.
[02:17:38] That's how we build the supply chain.
[02:17:40] That's how we build America.
[02:17:41] Yeah, and this, you mentioned that hunters
[02:17:45] are probably the most patriotic people in this country
[02:17:50] as a whole, right?
[02:17:51] And that's one of the things that,
[02:17:53] in talking to Cam Haynes, right?
[02:17:55] I mean, just a world renowned hunter.
[02:18:01] He was looking for what he's gonna wear when he hunts.
[02:18:07] He needed someone to come on board with him.
[02:18:09] He needed someone to support him in his efforts.
[02:18:12] And he could go with any company in the world.
[02:18:14] I mean, he's one of the best, if not the best.
[02:18:19] Certainly the most popular of hunters.
[02:18:24] And, you know, when, and luckily, of course,
[02:18:28] he hunts with Kip, right?
[02:18:30] He hunts with Kip and they're great friends.
[02:18:33] And so that's awesome.
[02:18:35] But still, like he's a guy that's got, you know,
[02:18:39] a family to support in a whole nine yards.
[02:18:41] So it's not just about, oh, well, this is my buddy.
[02:18:43] So we're going.
[02:18:44] Man, what, when I talked to Cam, you know,
[02:18:49] when I talked to Cam, what I talked to him about was,
[02:18:54] was we're doing this in America, you know,
[02:18:56] and he's got a son that's in the Rangers.
[02:18:58] I mean, this, you know, he's a patriotic hard working
[02:19:01] American, he's a, he's a, he's a blue collar guy
[02:19:03] that's worked his ass off.
[02:19:05] And he knows what that means.
[02:19:06] He knows what it's like.
[02:19:07] He knows what it means to supply jobs to other Americans.
[02:19:11] And, you know, from my perspective,
[02:19:13] and then look, it was also, hey, you're going to be,
[02:19:15] have a huge influence over what we make and how we make it.
[02:19:18] This is going to be designed.
[02:19:19] This is going to have your blessing.
[02:19:20] And as Cam's blessing, you know, what else do we want?
[02:19:23] Right?
[02:19:24] So, but it was awesome to be able to get Cam involved,
[02:19:30] to bring Cam on as an owner.
[02:19:33] Because the reason is, look, he's not going to compromise
[02:19:37] on performance.
[02:19:38] It's not happening.
[02:19:39] I mean, look at this dude.
[02:19:40] He's running, he's running the marathon every day, right?
[02:19:43] There's no compromise on performance with Cam.
[02:19:45] So he's not going to compromise there.
[02:19:48] And he's not going to compromise on his patriotism,
[02:19:50] on his love for this country.
[02:19:51] And, you know, I mean, I talked about it with him.
[02:19:54] I'm like, hey, when we, when we buy stuff
[02:19:57] from other countries, we're putting money
[02:19:59] into the pockets of our adversaries.
[02:20:03] Yes.
[02:20:04] And that's a horrible thing.
[02:20:07] And that's just, this is the way it is, man.
[02:20:08] That's just the way it is.
[02:20:10] And there's no two ways about that.
[02:20:12] This, that's what we, this is an economic war.
[02:20:14] And the, that, that claim, that's not just rhetoric,
[02:20:18] like, oh, this is an economic war,
[02:20:19] but no, no, this is an actual economic war.
[02:20:24] And our adversaries are fighting.
[02:20:25] And sometimes, you know, even if you look at,
[02:20:28] at China's past and what, what their theories of war are,
[02:20:34] what Sun Tzu said about war, they want to fight
[02:20:37] without their opponent knowing that there's a war going on.
[02:20:40] That's what they want.
[02:20:43] So of course they don't make a big deal out of it,
[02:20:45] but that's what's happening.
[02:20:47] And, and so it was awesome to have Cam come on board
[02:20:52] to a company that didn't even exist, you know?
[02:20:55] Didn't even exist.
[02:20:58] But for him to know, you know what?
[02:21:00] This is the right thing to do.
[02:21:02] And so thanks to Cam and, and for coming on board
[02:21:06] and then helping with the design has been freaking awesome.
[02:21:09] And it's been cool.
[02:21:10] He's already out there hunting right now, by the way.
[02:21:12] He's out there getting after it.
[02:21:13] There's already blood on the Raptor Camo at this time.
[02:21:18] So, so that's freaking legit.
[02:21:23] But not an easy thing to get done, man.
[02:21:26] Holy crap.
[02:21:28] No, man.
[02:21:29] It was, I'd never seen roller printing before.
[02:21:33] We didn't know if the wool would hold, you know,
[02:21:36] like this, this stealth wool that we gleaned
[02:21:38] from the special, special forces, we, we tweaked it,
[02:21:42] you know, so we, we took what they were using for this glove
[02:21:46] and we tweaked it for our liking with the,
[02:21:49] with the blend that we wanted.
[02:21:52] And then it's like scorched under a thousand degree heat
[02:21:55] in it, in it, in it, in it scorches the outside
[02:21:58] and gives it almost a shell, a little bit of a shell
[02:22:00] type of feel.
[02:22:01] And we're like, cool, all that's cool.
[02:22:03] Can we print it?
[02:22:05] You know, like we don't have no idea,
[02:22:06] but you have to like run a sizable amount of the product,
[02:22:11] which is not cheap at 50 bucks a yard, right?
[02:22:14] You got to run us a bunch of it to see if you can print it.
[02:22:17] So you're taking all these little risks, you know,
[02:22:21] and it really is, is what it's taking to do all this is,
[02:22:25] you're just taking risks.
[02:22:27] What's the worst that can happen?
[02:22:28] You lose some money.
[02:22:30] Okay.
[02:22:31] What's more important, losing money
[02:22:34] or rebuilding this thing.
[02:22:36] So we take the risks, right?
[02:22:38] But seeing for the first time that like stealth will go
[02:22:43] through that roller printer and come off the other side.
[02:22:46] I was like, bro, I mean, I had no words.
[02:22:50] Like I looked at Kip, he looked at me, you know,
[02:22:53] he's like, are you kidding me, man?
[02:22:55] Look at this shit.
[02:22:56] I'm like, yeah, bro, like this is it.
[02:22:58] It was at that point, I was a believer, you know,
[02:23:02] I was a believer, like we actually can build
[02:23:06] a innovative, high performing hunt line in America.
[02:23:12] Cause there's some, there's some good technical stuff
[02:23:14] out there, you know, there is.
[02:23:16] And we still got it.
[02:23:18] I guess that's what I would say, like we still got it.
[02:23:21] And it launched what's today, the 20, 26,
[02:23:25] 26 public, so it launched for pre-order,
[02:23:27] for pre-order because today.
[02:23:30] Yeah.
[02:23:31] It's pre-order now because what we made is sold.
[02:23:33] Well, yeah, it's because we're making the stuff right now.
[02:23:36] And we're still weaving some of the textiles
[02:23:38] for some of the line.
[02:23:40] And, you know, we're literally making it.
[02:23:42] It's not like all pre-made, it didn't come over
[02:23:44] in a freaking container.
[02:23:46] And we didn't just bring it into a warehouse
[02:23:48] and ship it out, we're freaking making the shit.
[02:23:49] So if people want it and they want to, you know,
[02:23:53] help and wear something on American land
[02:23:57] that's American made, put the pre-order in.
[02:23:59] Yeah, well, the other thing that we were talking about
[02:24:02] earlier you were explaining to me is we have limited
[02:24:07] amount of fabric, we have limited amount of time,
[02:24:09] we have limited amount of capacity
[02:24:11] to actually make this stuff.
[02:24:12] So if you are out there and you need the woodland cami
[02:24:20] instead of the highland cami, we need to know that now.
[02:24:24] So we can make it for you.
[02:24:25] And if you need a size whatever XL and your wife needs
[02:24:30] a size medium, we need to know that
[02:24:32] so we can make the right thing.
[02:24:34] So that's why the pre-order is important on this stuff
[02:24:38] so we can make the right amount of stuff
[02:24:39] and get it out to y'all.
[02:24:43] What else, man?
[02:24:45] I mean, I know there's a ton of,
[02:24:46] that's kind of like the broad strokes of the last year.
[02:24:48] What about camp this year?
[02:24:49] How was camp?
[02:24:50] How was camp?
[02:24:51] Back with Charles, you've been quiet.
[02:24:52] How's camp?
[02:24:52] Good camp.
[02:24:53] Yeah?
[02:24:54] More mellow, a lot more people, but more mellow.
[02:24:56] Yeah, you've been chill, man.
[02:24:57] I've been watching you out of the corner of my,
[02:24:59] this has been a good conversation.
[02:25:01] Yeah, over here just cruising.
[02:25:03] Yep, that's true.
[02:25:04] Echo and I are matching right now.
[02:25:06] We're wearing that spring hoodie.
[02:25:08] New favorite, by the way.
[02:25:09] Yeah, that's nice.
[02:25:10] It's a good look.
[02:25:11] Jiu-Jitsu is getting more popular.
[02:25:13] Dude, it's exploding.
[02:25:15] People love Jiu-Jitsu.
[02:25:18] Are you concerned?
[02:25:19] So we got Gal Val versus Gordon Ryan coming up.
[02:25:23] Yeah.
[02:25:26] Here's my concern.
[02:25:27] It's gonna be hype, right?
[02:25:29] It's gonna be hype.
[02:25:31] One of my concerns, like they're saying
[02:25:33] there's gonna be 20,000 people live.
[02:25:35] Are you going to the ADC?
[02:25:36] It doesn't look like it,
[02:25:37] because I'll be in the mountains hunting.
[02:25:39] Oh, in Raptor Campbell.
[02:25:40] Yes, in Raptor Campbell.
[02:25:44] And it's on Sunday too.
[02:25:45] So I actually, I can confirm right now,
[02:25:47] I will not be there, unfortunately.
[02:25:49] So here's my concern about this.
[02:25:56] Jiu-Jitsu, in that match,
[02:25:58] well, Jiu-Jitsu 4 can be boring to watch
[02:26:02] in certain situations.
[02:26:03] There are, there's a, what percentage chance
[02:26:06] that this is a boring match, Echo Charles?
[02:26:09] I don't think it'll be boring.
[02:26:10] Okay, so you don't think,
[02:26:11] you think it's a 100% exciting match?
[02:26:13] I think the chance of it being exciting
[02:26:14] is like 85 to 90%.
[02:26:17] Okay, so okay, I'm gonna reverse.
[02:26:19] You think it's, I think it's,
[02:26:21] I think it's gonna be lackluster.
[02:26:23] I think Andre's gonna play anti-Jiu-Jitsu
[02:26:26] and try to hit like when the points start.
[02:26:29] A double leg with three minutes left.
[02:26:31] Yes, that's what I think is gonna happen.
[02:26:33] Okay, is that the, what's the rule set, ADCC?
[02:26:35] It's 20 minutes.
[02:26:36] So it's a super fight in ADCC.
[02:26:38] 10 minutes, no points.
[02:26:39] Right.
[02:26:40] 10 minutes, points.
[02:26:42] 10 minute overtime, 10 minute overtime.
[02:26:45] So it's, it could be a total of 40 minutes.
[02:26:48] And there's, so that's the rule set, I'm pretty sure.
[02:26:51] Yeah.
[02:26:53] I think if Gordon doesn't,
[02:26:56] you know how he calls out his submissions or whatever.
[02:26:59] If he just goes in there to win,
[02:27:01] I think it could be exciting.
[02:27:02] Oh, he like, 100% is gonna do that.
[02:27:03] Not like I'm gonna do this to Aaron Elville.
[02:27:04] Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:27:05] He's not gonna do that.
[02:27:06] Here's the thing, man, it is freaking hard
[02:27:09] to do Jiu-Jitsu against someone that is avoiding Jiu-Jitsu.
[02:27:13] And,
[02:27:14] you know, that can be really hard.
[02:27:20] And if that's the game that Andre plays,
[02:27:24] then that might be boring.
[02:27:25] Hey, if Andre goes at him, right on.
[02:27:28] We're gonna have an awesome, an awesome match.
[02:27:32] But that could happen.
[02:27:35] We could, I'm worried that might be not as exciting
[02:27:38] as we want it to be.
[02:27:40] And I started talking yesterday, who was I talking to?
[02:27:43] I was talking to some people at camp.
[02:27:44] And I was like, some kind of a hybrid.
[02:27:47] Like in wrestling, you can get called for stalling.
[02:27:51] And here's the problem with that.
[02:27:54] Calling people for stalling in Jiu-Jitsu
[02:27:55] goes against one of the principles of Jiu-Jitsu,
[02:27:58] which is conservation of energy, right?
[02:28:00] So my goal, if I'm going against a big wrestler,
[02:28:03] my actual goal is to not work and make them work and stall.
[02:28:08] That's my goal.
[02:28:09] That's how Jiu-Jitsu wins in that situation.
[02:28:12] So to create a rule where you can't do that,
[02:28:17] you can't stall, which is technically what you're doing,
[02:28:19] right? You're stalling.
[02:28:20] You're holding someone in your guard and you're stalling.
[02:28:22] You're making them trying to pass, you're stalling.
[02:28:24] You're not attacking, you're not trying to sweep them.
[02:28:25] You're not, you're stalling.
[02:28:26] That's stalling.
[02:28:27] So there's a problem with that rule
[02:28:29] because it goes against one of the principles of Jiu-Jitsu,
[02:28:31] which kind of sucks.
[02:28:32] Yeah. And if you look at like the match with Galvo,
[02:28:38] and I think it was Huron or Hena Gracie
[02:28:41] where he was showing how to defend someone
[02:28:47] who was a world champion.
[02:28:48] Remember this match?
[02:28:49] Metamoros.
[02:28:50] Metamoros, there you go.
[02:28:51] Who is showing what?
[02:28:52] So basically, was it Hena or Huron?
[02:28:55] Hena Gracie.
[02:28:55] Hena Gracie.
[02:28:56] And he fought Galvo.
[02:28:58] And Huron doesn't compete.
[02:28:59] And Galvo was a world champion at this point.
[02:29:02] And Galvo was trying to submit him for 10, 20 minutes.
[02:29:08] Yeah, 20.
[02:29:08] Doesn't submit him.
[02:29:10] Why? Well, he played defense.
[02:29:12] He survived, he played defense and good to go.
[02:29:15] It wasn't a draw.
[02:29:17] Because it was a submission only fight.
[02:29:18] No, it wasn't a no-me.
[02:29:19] You know what I mean?
[02:29:20] So I think Andre knows both sides of that.
[02:29:24] So I hope he engages.
[02:29:27] I mean, after the whole situation with Gordon Slapping
[02:29:30] and everything, I'd wanna prove something.
[02:29:35] You know what I mean?
[02:29:35] Like when they had that little exchange
[02:29:37] that's that, yeah, I mean, I hope it's fireworks.
[02:29:43] You know, I mean, yeah.
[02:29:44] And I guess the reason I brought that up is cause, you know,
[02:29:46] we're here at Jiu-Jitsu Camp.
[02:29:47] So Jiu-Jitsu is on the mind, but also like just talking
[02:29:50] about the popularity of Jiu-Jitsu
[02:29:51] and how so many more people are engaged.
[02:29:54] The biggest camp we've ever had, right?
[02:29:55] Biggest camp we've ever had.
[02:29:57] And because of that explosion, man,
[02:30:00] adding two new looms to the factory,
[02:30:01] they showed up on Friday.
[02:30:03] We're gonna get those things installed
[02:30:04] and start ripping out more geese and obviously
[02:30:08] new grappling shorts, which you're gonna try.
[02:30:10] Yeah, yeah.
[02:30:12] Might have to make some tweaks.
[02:30:13] They're freaking nice though.
[02:30:14] That material is perfect.
[02:30:15] Yeah.
[02:30:16] It's a weird material cause you feel like
[02:30:18] it's not even on you.
[02:30:19] Like you kind of feel like you're freaking in Spartacus
[02:30:22] over there grappling naked.
[02:30:23] You know what I'm saying?
[02:30:24] It's so like light and flexible.
[02:30:26] I'm gonna hold you back, man.
[02:30:27] It's freaking legit.
[02:30:29] Did you, yes or no, get tears in your eyes
[02:30:33] when I promoted my daughter to blue belt?
[02:30:36] I did.
[02:30:37] I did.
[02:30:38] I get it.
[02:30:40] Amanda, my wife says to me,
[02:30:41] the only time you cry is belts and babies.
[02:30:45] You don't cry when people die.
[02:30:46] I don't.
[02:30:47] I don't cry at death.
[02:30:48] It's belts and babies.
[02:30:51] I know the, I don't know what it is about babies.
[02:30:54] Honestly, if there's a baby around crying,
[02:30:57] I sweat immediately cause you know,
[02:31:00] having babies and getting up in the middle of the night,
[02:31:02] you kind of get into this difficult sleeping situation.
[02:31:06] So I, I'll sweat when there's a baby crying
[02:31:09] near me immediately.
[02:31:11] But belts, knowing the work it goes
[02:31:14] and the relationship and the commitment,
[02:31:17] seeing you promote Rana was, was pretty moving.
[02:31:21] And I kind of was trying to dry out my eyes a little bit.
[02:31:25] And I had one single,
[02:31:28] why do I have to wipe?
[02:31:29] It might have been a tear or two,
[02:31:31] but I had a white, but your eyes were a little wet there.
[02:31:34] Yeah, there was a little dusty in there.
[02:31:36] Yeah, why is there a little dusty?
[02:31:37] Echo Charles, yay or nay?
[02:31:39] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:31:40] Oh, you did?
[02:31:41] It was very dusty in there.
[02:31:41] Yeah.
[02:31:42] But, but I did do it comparatively speaking,
[02:31:44] I did a good job.
[02:31:45] Yeah, you did.
[02:31:46] Here's the, here's the thing I thought about later.
[02:31:48] And it, okay.
[02:31:50] Okay, so she got her blue belt.
[02:31:52] Technically getting your blue belt is not a big deal.
[02:31:55] I mean, honestly, right?
[02:31:57] Standard getting your blue belt is not a big deal.
[02:31:59] And I didn't think about this till after,
[02:32:03] because getting your blue belts,
[02:32:05] listen, it's great you got your blue belt,
[02:32:07] but no one's hyped in a big way
[02:32:10] because you got your blue belt, right?
[02:32:12] But what, what it was, and the, I didn't realize this
[02:32:16] because I'm in it, is I, the journey that she's had
[02:32:20] to get her blue belt has been long and hard,
[02:32:25] and really long and hard.
[02:32:28] And, and, and it's been long and hard
[02:32:31] because of me as a dad.
[02:32:33] And so when she's, you know, when they were little kids,
[02:32:37] you heard me saying this in the, in the little speech I gave,
[02:32:40] I had my kids training Jiu Jitsu seven days a week,
[02:32:44] Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
[02:32:47] Saturday and Sunday.
[02:32:48] And on a couple of the three of those days,
[02:32:51] no, four of those days, they did striking and Jiu Jitsu.
[02:32:55] And they're like ages five, seven and nine.
[02:33:00] We would go to the gym on Saturday
[02:33:02] at we'd leave at seven 30 in the morning.
[02:33:05] I'd get home from the gym at two o'clock in the afternoon.
[02:33:07] They'd be with me the whole time.
[02:33:09] They'd take class, they'd take two classes of Jiu Jitsu
[02:33:11] and a striking class every day of the week.
[02:33:13] They're in there, they'd take both classes.
[02:33:16] I made them compete.
[02:33:19] Let me rephrase that.
[02:33:20] I mean, and by the way, anyone that's listening
[02:33:22] is like, hell yeah, no, this is wrong.
[02:33:24] It wasn't good.
[02:33:25] I made them compete.
[02:33:27] When I made them compete, this is my first three kids.
[02:33:31] When I made them compete, I made them compete
[02:33:33] up a weight class, up an age group, up a belt level.
[02:33:38] And what happens when you go up a weight class,
[02:33:42] up an age group and up a belt level, you get smashed.
[02:33:45] And in my mind, I'm thinking,
[02:33:47] hey, I'm a great dad, I'm gonna make them tougher.
[02:33:49] But all it did was make Jiu Jitsu suck
[02:33:51] because you go to a tournament, you compete, you lose.
[02:33:54] And I just thought I'm making them tougher and I'm not.
[02:33:56] I'm actually making Jiu Jitsu suck for them,
[02:33:58] making it a bad experience.
[02:34:01] And eventually, they got old enough where it was like,
[02:34:07] I don't wanna do this anymore.
[02:34:09] And my two daughters, at a certain age,
[02:34:12] and they were the oldest of the three,
[02:34:14] and I have four now, but they were the oldest of three.
[02:34:16] They protested to a point where it's like,
[02:34:20] my wife said, hey, you can't do this to these girls anymore.
[02:34:24] So, let's say we settled it down, didn't train as much.
[02:34:30] But, and then luckily,
[02:34:34] Rana, when she got to high school,
[02:34:39] I persuaded her to wrestle.
[02:34:42] I persuaded her to wrestle.
[02:34:43] And to be quite honest with you,
[02:34:44] I persuaded her to wrestle with money.
[02:34:47] I was like, I will pay you to wrestle.
[02:34:50] I'll pay you to go and wrestle.
[02:34:52] And so she did it.
[02:34:54] And it took a little while
[02:34:56] before she wasn't doing it for the money anymore.
[02:34:59] She was doing it, she was into it.
[02:35:01] But again, this is after going through a lot of stress
[02:35:05] and tournaments as a little kid
[02:35:07] and Jiu Jitsu tournaments and all that.
[02:35:10] And now she's wrestling.
[02:35:12] She wrestled all through high school.
[02:35:14] Her first year, she's the only girl in the wrestling team.
[02:35:17] She was in wrestling room.
[02:35:18] A sweaty, gross wrestling room.
[02:35:21] Filled with ringworm.
[02:35:22] And filled with ringworm and filled with, you know,
[02:35:24] 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 year old boys.
[02:35:31] That's what she's in there with.
[02:35:33] And she stuck it out.
[02:35:34] And she ended up, you know, going through that program
[02:35:38] and eventually making it to state in California,
[02:35:41] which is a huge deal.
[02:35:42] And first person from her school
[02:35:46] that's made it to state in like 35 years
[02:35:48] or something like this.
[02:35:49] So, and it was her.
[02:35:51] Like the program, the program just didn't have the wherewithal
[02:35:56] to get a student to do that.
[02:35:58] She did it, you know?
[02:36:01] And then finally she goes to college.
[02:36:04] And while she's at college,
[02:36:06] she decides she's gonna try that as Jiu Jitsu again.
[02:36:09] Wow.
[02:36:10] Which is freaking awesome.
[02:36:12] And you know what, after about a week,
[02:36:16] she called me, she's crying.
[02:36:19] She cried over her first week of Jiu Jitsu.
[02:36:22] No one wants to train with me.
[02:36:24] I don't think anyone wants to train with a girl.
[02:36:26] No one wants to train with me.
[02:36:27] And you know, it's stress.
[02:36:29] There's college and all this other stuff going on.
[02:36:31] There's a little morsel of her life.
[02:36:33] And there's a lot of stuff going on.
[02:36:34] And this is where it comes out.
[02:36:36] And I'm like, hey, don't worry.
[02:36:37] Everything's gonna be cool.
[02:36:38] You know, you're gonna get to know people.
[02:36:40] It's fine.
[02:36:41] Just keep going.
[02:36:43] Please keep going.
[02:36:44] And sure, she's kept going.
[02:36:47] Paragon, slow.
[02:36:49] And that's where she trains.
[02:36:50] And great, I ended up going up there
[02:36:51] teaching a little bit up there.
[02:36:53] But it's just a great academy.
[02:36:54] She ended up making great friends and working her ass off.
[02:36:59] And this is, you know, this is what she's 21 now.
[02:37:02] So we're talking about like a 16 year journey, right?
[02:37:06] This is the longest, this is most of her life,
[02:37:08] you know what I'm saying?
[02:37:10] And so then finally, so when she comes back,
[02:37:12] so now she's been training for two years up there.
[02:37:15] Hard, hard, two days, you know, stuff like this.
[02:37:20] And so she comes back down to San Diego this summer
[02:37:25] and she's teaching, she's helping teach kids classes,
[02:37:28] but she's training all the time, training.
[02:37:29] And immediately my black belts are like, dude,
[02:37:35] you need to get your belt.
[02:37:36] I rolled with it.
[02:37:37] You rolled with it.
[02:37:38] Yeah, you need to get your belt.
[02:37:39] I rolled another color belt.
[02:37:41] And I kind of felt like, well, you know,
[02:37:43] she's up at Paragon now.
[02:37:45] And that's like, you know, her teachers and her instructors.
[02:37:49] And so I just said, hey guys, you know, she's up at Paragon.
[02:37:52] She'll get, you know, hopefully she gets promoted
[02:37:53] when she gets back up there.
[02:37:54] And then like, she's tapping out a bunch of people
[02:37:57] in the academy.
[02:37:58] And my black belts, once again, you know,
[02:38:01] Coach Adams like, dude, come on.
[02:38:04] Coach Bryan's like, dude, you're you kidding me?
[02:38:07] Then I rolled with her.
[02:38:08] And I was like, oh, okay, this is not fair.
[02:38:11] And so finally what I did reached out to her professors
[02:38:14] up there and I sent him a text or a message on Instagram,
[02:38:19] gave my phone number and said, hey, I need to talk to you.
[02:38:21] It's Jocko, can you give me a call?
[02:38:23] And the coach Chris, he called me up
[02:38:26] and I knew the number from that area code.
[02:38:27] And I answered, hey, hello, this is Jocko.
[02:38:30] And he's like, hey, it's Chris.
[02:38:32] He goes, I've been waiting for this call.
[02:38:34] And I was like, that's like the best thing I've ever heard.
[02:38:37] So, you know, he didn't want to promote her
[02:38:38] because it's my daughter.
[02:38:40] I didn't want to promote her because, you know,
[02:38:42] she's been training with them.
[02:38:43] They're putting a lot of work and effort into her.
[02:38:45] But so that was cool.
[02:38:47] So she did one more tournament as a white belt, double gold.
[02:38:49] And then we came out here to camp and got the promotion.
[02:38:52] So, so again, I realized afterwards I was like,
[02:38:55] it's kind of weird that I kind of like echo,
[02:38:57] you got your black belt at camp.
[02:39:01] We all understand that's a big deal, right?
[02:39:03] That's 15 years of training for you.
[02:39:06] That's getting smashed, complete.
[02:39:08] Like all those things, they ever kind of gets that.
[02:39:10] But for Rano, it's like, oh, it's like,
[02:39:12] oh, she got a blue belt.
[02:39:13] That's pretty cool.
[02:39:14] But I think it was like everybody kind of sensed it
[02:39:17] because people were freaking hyped.
[02:39:18] Oh yeah, man, that place was crazy.
[02:39:20] Of course she was crying.
[02:39:22] I mean, they were crying.
[02:39:24] You weren't crying.
[02:39:25] They were crying.
[02:39:26] Yeah.
[02:39:27] That is awesome.
[02:39:30] That's what it's about.
[02:39:31] And yeah.
[02:39:32] That's what it's all about.
[02:39:33] That's what it's all about.
[02:39:34] And Jiu-Jitsu is something that really brings people together.
[02:39:38] And look, just like you can't impose things on your platoon
[02:39:41] and you can't impose things on your workforce,
[02:39:43] you can't impose things on your family.
[02:39:45] But you can, if you're lucky, you can help them see the light.
[02:39:49] You can help show them the path.
[02:39:51] And when they find that path, when you show it to them
[02:39:53] and it's there and they decide, you can lead a horse to water,
[02:39:58] but you can't make a drink.
[02:39:59] But when you get them there and they jump in,
[02:40:02] man, that's one of the best things you could hope for.
[02:40:05] So that was kind of a highlighted camp for me.
[02:40:09] Dude, it was awesome.
[02:40:10] Freaking awesome.
[02:40:13] All right, what else?
[02:40:13] Anything else, Pete?
[02:40:14] Any closing thoughts?
[02:40:15] No, man.
[02:40:16] I appreciate you having me on.
[02:40:18] Appreciate the, obviously, all the support over the years.
[02:40:21] And of course, you telling the world about what we're doing
[02:40:27] and why and keeping everybody's attention on it.
[02:40:30] Because with all the attention grabbing going on these days,
[02:40:34] anyone giving anything time these days is valuable.
[02:40:38] So, man, I appreciate you.
[02:40:40] Appreciate bringing me on again.
[02:40:42] It's awesome.
[02:40:42] Well, you'd be on all the time if you weren't freaking living
[02:40:45] in Farmington, Maine, and I wasn't living in San Diego,
[02:40:47] California.
[02:40:49] And listen, look, what we're doing right now,
[02:40:52] this is a campaign.
[02:40:54] This is not one battle.
[02:40:56] And we are going to lose.
[02:40:58] We're going to miss things, and we have missed things.
[02:41:00] And we're going to make mistakes.
[02:41:03] But there are opportunities out there.
[02:41:06] And what we are going to do is we're
[02:41:09] going to make everything in America.
[02:41:11] And I told this story yesterday when we were in the factory.
[02:41:15] It's no compromise.
[02:41:17] It's a no compromise situation.
[02:41:20] And actually, I do remember the item.
[02:41:23] We were making, what do you call the, we were making spats.
[02:41:31] And we needed an elastic waistband.
[02:41:34] And you and I were having a conversation,
[02:41:38] and someone came up with a solution.
[02:41:40] It was, you said, hey, John, I'm like, hey, man,
[02:41:43] when are we getting these spats?
[02:41:44] What's happening with that?
[02:41:46] And you're like, well, it's pause.
[02:41:48] The manufacturer is going to take four months before they
[02:41:51] can tool this thing up, blah, blah, blah.
[02:41:52] OK.
[02:41:53] Or we got to get this machine and we'll be able to do ourselves.
[02:41:55] OK.
[02:41:55] I'm like, are there any solutions?
[02:41:57] Finally, we get a solution.
[02:41:58] The solution is, hey, there's an overseas company that
[02:42:01] can have this stuff to us in three weeks.
[02:42:03] Airship, boom, done.
[02:42:05] And you were just like, no compromise.
[02:42:10] And I was like, of course, no compromise.
[02:42:13] And that attitude is hard.
[02:42:17] It's hard to hold the line.
[02:42:18] And listen, do you compromise in life?
[02:42:22] When your spouse wants something and you want something else
[02:42:26] and you compromise to come to a conclusion?
[02:42:28] Yeah.
[02:42:28] Do you compromise when you're on a team
[02:42:30] and you're working together and someone's got one plan
[02:42:32] and you've got a different idea and you compromise to make
[02:42:34] things work?
[02:42:34] Yes, absolutely.
[02:42:35] Do you compromise when you negotiate to make a deal happen?
[02:42:38] Yes, you absolutely do.
[02:42:40] So in life, you've got to compromise.
[02:42:42] But there's things also in life that you don't compromise on
[02:42:46] and where you hold the line.
[02:42:47] And that's what we're doing here.
[02:42:49] We're doing it at Jock of Fuel.
[02:42:50] We're doing it at Origin.
[02:42:52] We're not going to compromise.
[02:42:53] We're going to hold the line.
[02:42:55] And the reason we're able to do that
[02:42:56] is because everyone that's listening to this right now.
[02:42:58] So none of this happens.
[02:43:01] None of this.
[02:43:03] Nothing.
[02:43:03] This doesn't exist.
[02:43:04] What we're talking about doesn't exist without you
[02:43:08] that's sitting there listening to this podcast right now,
[02:43:11] listening to what we're doing, participating
[02:43:13] in what we're doing without your support.
[02:43:15] None of this happens.
[02:43:17] So thank you for your support.
[02:43:21] And I'm going to tell you right now,
[02:43:24] we will not let you down.
[02:43:29] Echo Charles.
[02:43:30] Yes, sir.
[02:43:32] How can people support the podcast?
[02:43:36] How can they support themselves?
[02:43:37] How can they support these companies?
[02:43:40] And how can they in doing so support America?
[02:43:42] What do you got?
[02:43:43] What do you got to do?
[02:43:44] Well, some of this is just one big reminder,
[02:43:46] because you guys been kind of talking about it for a long time.
[02:43:49] But yeah, so reminder or a recap, we'll say.
[02:43:52] JacoFuel.com.
[02:43:54] JacoFuel.com.
[02:43:55] We got Moq, the new Moq RTD is ready to drink
[02:43:59] if you didn't pick that up.
[02:44:00] Not yet online.
[02:44:01] It's not yet online.
[02:44:02] No, not yet.
[02:44:03] We haven't made enough yet for a while.
[02:44:04] Yeah, we have made enough yet.
[02:44:06] OK.
[02:44:06] But soon.
[02:44:06] We'll be on the lookout for that one.
[02:44:08] How about that?
[02:44:09] Because we're over here all week drill.
[02:44:10] Not only.
[02:44:10] They kind of ran out quick.
[02:44:11] But we stole some from the warehouse to drink this week.
[02:44:15] Yeah, we experienced that one.
[02:44:16] That's good.
[02:44:17] A little detail that I noticed about the RTD,
[02:44:20] they're like, you'd think the powder is more versatile,
[02:44:22] because you can mix stuff in the thing.
[02:44:24] But this becomes more versatile in a different way,
[02:44:26] because you can use it on other things, like cereal, cookies.
[02:44:30] I'm not saying I did that.
[02:44:31] I'm not saying I didn't do that.
[02:44:32] But I'm just saying you'll put it on other stuff.
[02:44:35] Typically, you don't mix a protein shake,
[02:44:37] add your favorite this and that, and then put it on.
[02:44:39] So you don't do that usually.
[02:44:41] But this one, you do that.
[02:44:43] I think we all found that out pretty quick,
[02:44:44] because I saw a lot of people doing that stuff.
[02:44:46] I like the double hitter, mulking one hand, going the other.
[02:44:50] It's a good morning double hitter.
[02:44:51] You know what I'm saying?
[02:44:53] Mulking go, baby.
[02:44:54] Mulking go.
[02:44:55] That makes complete sense to me.
[02:44:56] Also, a reminder, or we didn't talk about the joint warfare
[02:45:00] stuff or whatever, but yeah, just look after your joints.
[02:45:03] We're not getting younger.
[02:45:05] Look out for your joints.
[02:45:06] Are you getting older?
[02:45:06] Don't pay attention.
[02:45:07] I'm over here doing the best I can.
[02:45:10] So yes, joint warfare, supercrill oil,
[02:45:12] got some vitamin D3, general health.
[02:45:15] These are important things.
[02:45:16] If the what, if your oil runs out in your car, right?
[02:45:20] That's a problem.
[02:45:20] That's not good.
[02:45:21] Yeah, yeah.
[02:45:22] It's Dean Lister would say that's a problem.
[02:45:24] Same anyway, so pay attention to these things.
[02:45:28] Where a kid mucked us for the kids, of course,
[02:45:30] like the kids version.
[02:45:32] Yeah, all this stuff at jockelfield.com and also other places.
[02:45:35] Yeah, also you can get the drinks at Wawa.
[02:45:38] Actually, the RTD muck is going into Wawa.
[02:45:41] It is.
[02:45:42] We already shipped, I believe.
[02:45:44] So if you're East Coast, you got that Wawa going there
[02:45:48] and get that muck later.
[02:45:50] And it should be it should be going in by like it goes.
[02:45:54] It gets shipped to there, whatever.
[02:45:56] And then they ship it to the store.
[02:45:58] So between mid and end of September, it'll be in.
[02:46:02] And it's muck and go people and maybe grab a hoagie too.
[02:46:09] Vitamin shop, H E B.
[02:46:12] There's I failed to get this list on here.
[02:46:16] We're in a bunch of retailers.

[02:47:51] Only Cry for the Living by Holly McKay.
[02:47:55] That girl risked her life to go in and write these books,
[02:47:57] go in there and buy that book.
[02:47:58] See that story.
[02:47:59] See what war is like, like almost as it's unfolding.
[02:48:03] My wife's reading it right now.
[02:48:04] She's really enjoying it.
[02:48:05] It's really good book.
[02:48:06] Yeah.
[02:48:07] Enjoy might be the wrong word.
[02:48:08] Because it's hard to enjoy.
[02:48:09] She's engaged.
[02:48:10] She's engaged.
[02:48:11] She's really engaged with the book.
[02:48:12] It's a tough one.
[02:48:14] Yeah.
[02:48:14] You know I wrote a bunch of other books.
[02:48:15] Check them out.
[02:48:16] Eshalonfront.com.
[02:48:17] We solve problems through leadership.
[02:48:19] This is what the team at Eshalonfront does all the time.
[02:48:22] Culture.
[02:48:23] Merging of culture.
[02:48:24] Performance.
[02:48:26] Leadership.
[02:48:27] In every single industry, we're there.
[02:48:30] So check out Eshalonfront.com.
[02:48:32] We have an event.
[02:48:33] The event that you talked about, Pete, that Jason came to.
[02:48:36] It's called the muster.
[02:48:38] The next one is Atlanta.
[02:48:39] Unfortunately, it's sold out.
[02:48:40] But go on there.
[02:48:42] Come to one of our live events as well.
[02:48:44] And then on top of that, look, you
[02:48:46] might not be able to come to a live event.
[02:48:47] That's where we have online training.
[02:48:49] Extremeownership.com.
[02:48:50] We get a bunch of people from Origin on there too.
[02:48:52] Oh, yeah.
[02:48:53] Yeah.
[02:48:53] Oh, yeah.
[02:48:53] A bunch of people from Origin are on there,
[02:48:55] which is awesome to see.
[02:48:57] And we have live sessions.
[02:49:00] We do.
[02:49:01] We have prerecorded training sessions.
[02:49:02] It's just a way to train leadership.
[02:49:05] Like, and this is the interesting thing.
[02:49:07] Years ago, if someone had said, hey,
[02:49:09] people are going to learn Jiu-Jitsu by online academies,
[02:49:13] what would you have thought?
[02:49:13] Hell no.
[02:49:14] Hell no.
[02:49:14] What do you think now?
[02:49:15] Oh, hell yeah.
[02:49:16] I mean, I do.
[02:49:17] Yeah.
[02:49:18] Hell yes.
[02:49:19] So it's the same thing with leadership.
[02:49:21] And by the way, just like Jiu-Jitsu or playing guitar
[02:49:24] or playing basketball, you're not born with the skills.
[02:49:26] You need to learn them.
[02:49:27] Same thing with leadership.
[02:49:29] We made an online training academy, extremeownership.com.
[02:49:31] Go check that out.
[02:49:32] Help you with leadership.
[02:49:34] And it doesn't mean you're in charge of 420 people
[02:49:36] at your company.
[02:49:39] If you're alive and you interact with other human beings,
[02:49:42] you're in a leadership position.
[02:49:44] And you're leading them.
[02:49:45] So go and check that out.

[02:49:55] She's got an unbelievable charity organization.
[02:49:59] What they do is they help vets with their health
[02:50:02] and give them solutions to their health
[02:50:05] that the VA doesn't cover.
[02:50:07] So it's just an outstanding organization.
[02:50:09] She's an unbelievable woman.

[02:50:32] The social media thing.
[02:50:34] It's a double-edged sword.
[02:50:36] We get it.
[02:50:37] There's an algorithm that's trying to grab you.
[02:50:38] It's trying to waste your time.
[02:50:40] There's also some positive that can come out of it.

[02:51:10] They don't know love for the Yankee.
[02:51:13] For the Yankee.
[02:51:14] Oh, like the confirmed.
[02:51:17] Are you confirmed?
[02:51:18] I got so many fake accounts now, man.
[02:51:20] I get emails every day from people
[02:51:22] and they're soliciting them for crypto stuff.
[02:51:25] New accounts all the time.
[02:51:26] Make any big investments there in the crypto world
[02:51:28] through some random dude on Instagram.
[02:51:30] That sounds like a good plan.

[02:51:40] And Pete, thanks once again.
[02:51:44] Thank you.
[02:51:45] Thanks for all you've done and all you're doing.
[02:51:48] You know, you went out there with your friends and family
[02:51:50] and cut down a bunch of trees in the middle of the woods
[02:51:52] to make a factory.
[02:51:53] And that took some serious guts to do and you did it.
[02:51:57] And we appreciate that.
[02:51:59] And on top of that, thanks to all the hardworking people
[02:52:04] at Origin USA and JockoFuel who are out there cutting and sewing
[02:52:10] and designing and creating and packing and shipping
[02:52:13] and cleaning and working.
[02:52:18] Thanks to all of you for everything that you do.
[02:52:20] You all are the backbone of these companies.
[02:52:23] And we thank you for your hard work
[02:52:25] and your commitment to this dream.
[02:52:28] And you know what?
[02:52:29] To all the hardworking men and women of this great nation.
[02:52:33] And you're out there.
[02:52:34] I see you all the time in the fields and in the factories,
[02:52:39] on the construction sites and in the cubicles,
[02:52:41] on the oil rigs and the utility poles and hospitals
[02:52:44] and hotels and restaurants and warehouses.
[02:52:48] To all of you that toil and labor every day,
[02:52:51] thank you for what you do.
[02:52:55] It's what allows the lights to come on.
[02:52:58] And we appreciate it.
[02:52:59] And thanks to all the military out there
[02:53:01] for protecting the freedom that we have that allows us
[02:53:04] to do what we're doing.
[02:53:06] And we will do our part to build the economy and support you.
[02:53:12] And also thanks to police and law enforcement, firefighters,
[02:53:15] paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers,
[02:53:18] border patrol, secret service, and all first responders.
[02:53:22] Thank you for protecting our safety and security here at home
[02:53:26] and everyone else out there.
[02:53:30] Thank you.
[02:53:32] Thank you for your support.
[02:53:36] Thank you for listening and thank you for believing.
[02:53:40] And thank you for understanding what is at risk.
[02:53:44] And thank you for seeing what is happening in the world
[02:53:47] and seeing the darkness in the world.
[02:53:51] But still moving toward the light.
[02:53:54] Freedom is not free.
[02:53:57] It takes sacrifice.
[02:53:59] It takes guts.
[02:54:00] And it takes grit.
[02:54:02] And it takes work.
[02:54:06] So let's go get after it and get to work.
[02:54:11] And until next time, this is Pete and Echo and Jaco.
[02:54:15] Thank you for watching.
