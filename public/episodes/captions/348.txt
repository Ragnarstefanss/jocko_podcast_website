[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 348 with Echo Charles and me,
[00:00:03] Jocko willing. Good evening Echo. Good evening.
[00:00:06] We are turning our society upside down. One Kamirooge officer told a newsweek reporter in
[00:00:12] the weeks after the revolution. The people of Panam pen will grow rice, he said, and almost as
[00:00:20] an afterthought added they will work or starve. By early May 1975, the Kamirooge were implementing
[00:00:30] one of the most radical political plans of the 20th century, a peasant revolution with a punitive
[00:00:36] edge. Buddhist monks were made to plow fields. Pagodas were turned into killing centers.
[00:00:42] Cham Muslims, a religious minority, were force fed pork. Cambodia's national library was converted
[00:00:49] into a pigsty. In Pol Pot's democratic Campuchia, books were used to start fires.
[00:00:58] It was more about revenge, recalled one Cambodian. All private property, even money, was abolished
[00:01:06] in this ultra great leap forward. The early accounts of life under the Kamirooge came from
[00:01:15] Cambodian refugees who escaped to Thailand. At first they sounded too bizarre to be true,
[00:01:20] as if George Orwell had written them to satirize life under a dictatorship of the proletariat,
[00:01:27] a place where parents feared their children and civilians were slaughtered in numbers and for
[00:01:32] reasons unimagined since Stalin's purges or Hitler's Third Reich. Survivors described a system of
[00:01:39] slave labor, communes where men, women, and children toiled like human water buffalo under the
[00:01:47] watchful eye of the mysterious and all-powerful leadership cabal known only as Angar. They
[00:01:55] lived in perpetual fear. The CIA held little hope for America's former allies and educated
[00:02:05] Cambodians. Quote, executions are reported widespread and in many cases members of the entire
[00:02:13] family of former government officials or soldiers are executed along with the heads of the family.
[00:02:19] Almost all executions occur in the same manner. Several communist cadres beat the person to death
[00:02:26] with hoe handles or other blunt instruments. End quote. Not only did the Kamirooge eliminate
[00:02:34] family life, they made sex before marriage a capital offense. Kamirooge survivor Yuk Chang
[00:02:42] remembered watching two young lovers beaten to death in front of his entire commune.
[00:02:49] In a larger sense, the Kamirooge were threatened by all expressions of love between husband and wife,
[00:02:55] parents and children, friends and colleagues, observes Elizabeth Becker. One Kamirooge survivor
[00:03:04] is still haunted by his mother's final words. You have to learn how to live without me.
[00:03:14] Lang Thurth, Kamirooge minister of culture and social affairs stated quote,
[00:03:20] only children can purely serve the revolution and eliminate reactionism since they are young,
[00:03:28] obedient, loyal and active. End quote. So that right there is a little excerpt from a book called
[00:03:43] Facing Death in Cambodia. It's written by a man named Peter McGuire. And Peter has also written
[00:03:51] about the Nuremberg trials about the treatment of Nazi war criminals.
[00:03:56] But his focus has not always been on war or genocide. He actually has a pretty significant
[00:04:05] dichotomy in his life. Peter McGuire grew up a surfer in Southern California.
[00:04:10] That led to chasing the mythical endless summer that many surfers pursue. And he funded that
[00:04:21] chase by drug smuggling. Eventually he left that life for academia, where he received his
[00:04:31] doctorate in history. Along the way, he became a jujitsu practitioner. He's a historian, an author,
[00:04:40] a defense contractor, college professor. And he's lived an extremely multifaceted life. And it is
[00:04:47] a privilege to have Peter McGuire here with us tonight to share some of his experiences
[00:04:54] and some of his lessons learned. Well, thank you for having me. Yeah, thanks for coming out.
[00:04:59] I guess how did you and I originally connect? Surfer's Journal. I interviewed you. But how did
[00:05:06] you did you just reach out somehow? Through Ivan, I think. Through Ivan, man. So Ivan Trent is a
[00:05:15] former seal. And the reason I knew about Ivan Trent, well, when I got to on my first deployment,
[00:05:22] I was on my first deployment, I went to Guam, and I walk into like the headquarters area. And
[00:05:30] there's a picture hanging on the wall of a guy dropping in on a giant wave, big Hawaiian wave.
[00:05:36] And it's signed, you know, it says, you know, some cool quote. Ivan Trent. And I'm like,
[00:05:41] hmm, that's interesting. Well, it's Buzzy Trent's kid. And Buzzy, Buzzy Trent is one of the iconic
[00:05:46] guys that opened up big wave surfing for the world. And his son was a seal. And so you did an
[00:05:54] article about how did you know Ivan? I knew Ivan through the combat rescue boat that I did with
[00:06:02] George Greno. And so Ivan, our fathers surfed together in, you know, Malibu in the 50s. And so
[00:06:10] yeah. And so I reached out to Ivan and he was our greatest help and a true ally. And we became great
[00:06:18] friends. And I stayed with him in Virginia Beach whenever I went there, would have to do jiu-jitsu
[00:06:24] with his son on the on the carpet. I think his son might train here. And, and then his little
[00:06:30] Chihuahua dog would try to hump my leg. Yeah. So Ivan has Chihuahuas. That's speaking of dichotomy.
[00:06:37] Well, let's get into it. And just let's go through kind of how you ended up here because you have
[00:06:45] been on a wild ride. I mean, relatively speaking, your life's been a wild ride. So you're born
[00:06:54] in 1964. Tell us about your, tell us about your mom and dad. My mother was one of the first women
[00:07:02] screenwriters in in Hollywood, Joan Tuxbury. She wrote Robert Altman's Nashville, among other things.
[00:07:10] She was actually the ostrich in Mary Martin's Peter Pan on Broadway. She was a child kind of
[00:07:19] Shirley Temple in Hollywood, grew up in Hollywood. And my father was the son of a famous pilot,
[00:07:28] Robert Maguire, who ran operations Magic Carpet and operations Alibaba flying Yemenites and
[00:07:35] concentration camp survivors to Israel. So at 14, my father was a mechanics assistant in Tel Aviv
[00:07:42] Airport. He was flying missions with my grandfather. He was flying at 14. I think it wasn't DC
[00:07:50] 3s, but it was one of those big silver. Well, how did that, how did that happen? My grandfather was a
[00:07:57] pilot in World War Two, and then Alaska and airlines was hired to, to resettle Jews in Israel.
[00:08:07] So that's originally how he got involved. But then Alaskan Airways pulled out and he set up a company
[00:08:13] called Far Eastern Air Transport and flew a remarkable number of hours in a short amount of time.
[00:08:21] And Ben Goree and called them the Irish Moses. And the last chapter of Leon Urus's Exodus is called
[00:08:29] the King Crab King. And that was my grandfather who lived at Rincon, right at the indicator. And so,
[00:08:36] so my dad was a real wild guy. He died about a year ago. And he, so, you know, he gets,
[00:08:43] goes to Tel Aviv, his mother, their parents are divorced, she finds out that he's being raised
[00:08:48] by wolves in the Middle East. So they send him to a fancy French boarding school. He,
[00:08:54] So this is your dad, my dad. And so then he gets to the,
[00:08:59] So, so hold on. So your dad's mom realizes that your kid is, that your dad is like a
[00:09:04] feral child. Exactly.
[00:09:06] Running missions. Yeah.
[00:09:08] And says, we're going to get him the hell out of there. Yeah.
[00:09:10] I'm going to take him and send him to a French boarding school.
[00:09:13] Yeah. And so they send him there and the French couple that was supposed to be taking care of
[00:09:17] him, took the money and ran. And so he and an older kind of French nobleman whose parents
[00:09:23] had been killed in the Holocaust said, let's not tell anybody. And so they basically ran away
[00:09:30] and spent the better part of a year riding bikes around France, going to Nice, going to the
[00:09:37] hookers, going to the whole shebang. And then he moved to California after that. And there was
[00:09:41] no hope for Southern California. And so he became one of the biggest real estate developers in
[00:09:48] Los Angeles. He built Playa Vista and much of the skyline. And they called him the cat with
[00:09:54] 10 lives. And so it was a boomer bust life, like, you know, up one day and then a kids were moving
[00:10:02] and you're going back to public school. So in my DNA, I knew the only thing that could
[00:10:11] be taken away from me was an education. I knew there would be no inheritance, nothing. And he
[00:10:18] went public in I think 2008, 2009, had a billion dollars cash and then bet it all on black and
[00:10:30] basically bought the Blackstone Groups real estate portfolio two weeks before the subprime crisis
[00:10:38] and lost it all. And so he passed away about a year ago and inherited a few lawsuits.
[00:10:49] That's what you got out. Yeah, but he was a classic guy, you know. And so, you know, just big
[00:10:56] things were expected of you as a kid. I mean, my grandpa had, we always had boats. And if
[00:11:02] Ventura, my grandpa lived in the Ventura Keys, and if Ventura Harbor was closing out, well,
[00:11:07] that was a good day to take out the boat. Like, let's punch through. Yeah, yeah. And like, so that
[00:11:12] was not anything out of the ordinary for me. And so when I first took my job, I got my PhD at
[00:11:21] Columbia, my PhD advisor was Brigadier General Telfer Taylor, the chief prosecutor at Nuremberg.
[00:11:27] And I had friends who had set up a nonprofit to collect the photographs taken at Tool Slang Prison.
[00:11:37] The Khmer Rouge's central torture and execution facility, roughly 20,000 went in,
[00:11:43] roughly 20 survived, everyone got their picture taken. So they were preserving the negatives
[00:11:50] and the photographic record. At that time, the Khmer Rouge was still a major force to be reckoned
[00:11:56] with. So this is what this is 93, 94. So I go there in early 94. And it's very volatile. The UN
[00:12:05] has this incredibly absurd occupation where they treat the neutrality as the sacred principle.
[00:12:14] So it's the, it's the UN's model that goes wrong in the 90s. So the Khmer Rouge are allowed,
[00:12:20] you know, allowed to run in the election. They're treated. You know, there's no accountability.
[00:12:26] There's, you know, Khmer Rouge killed roughly, you know, we think 2 million out of 10 million.
[00:12:32] Yeah, it's like a quarter of the population. Yeah, in three years, 10 months, 20 days,
[00:12:38] most of them, you know, with with an ox cart, a handle, the axle to the back of the head.
[00:12:43] And no accountability when the Khmer Rouge falls in early 79 Thailand, China, Singapore,
[00:12:53] the US all back them. And so then Pol Pot et al become freedom fighters. And so,
[00:13:03] so it's just too bizarre. You couldn't make it up. And so there's absolutely no accountability. And
[00:13:07] I knew from my Nuremberg research is the only thing in that kind of situation, an unresolved
[00:13:15] conflict still fighting going on is historical accountability is preserving the empirical
[00:13:22] evidence of the crimes. So that was very important to me also was building the chains of command
[00:13:29] from the bloodstained butcher, who's usually the scapegoat. It's easy to try Lindy England or
[00:13:36] these kind of people and the garden variety, you know, sort of perpetrator, but to move up to the
[00:13:43] food chain like they did in Nuremberg to get the shot callers, policymakers. That's what I was more
[00:13:49] interested in the senior leaders. And so that was my goal. I also wanted to link them to their
[00:13:55] their masters, the Chinese government, because, you know, this was a Chinese sponsored affair.
[00:14:05] There were Chinese advisors throughout Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge years,
[00:14:09] and the Chinese have never copped to it. And they still, we didn't support the bad policies. And,
[00:14:16] you know, and they, I was there when Jingxia Main came for the first time. And we went to the press
[00:14:22] conference and one of my friends from the Wall Street Journal said, what about accountability?
[00:14:27] What do you say to the Cambodians? And he just started screaming at him and went, no, and stormed
[00:14:32] off the podium. And I went, wow, this is a different kind of press conference than I've ever been to.
[00:14:41] So that was my initial foray was, you know, with these photographs, finding the survivors.
[00:14:47] But then I was able to find the perpetrators. And I worked with a pretty remarkable guy named
[00:14:53] Sok Sin, who was he said, I'm remarkable survivor. And I use the weapon of the mouth.
[00:15:02] And I said, how did you survive the Khmer Rouge? He goes, I worked harder than any man. And I sang
[00:15:08] revolutionary songs louder than any man. And yeah. And so Sok Sin was a rough guy. And he,
[00:15:15] you know, started as a pedicab driver. And one of the guards at the hotel that was the Fancy Hotel,
[00:15:22] the press state would whip him with a chain, because he'd be too aggressive. So the chain
[00:15:26] that blocked the driveway, he'd whip Sok Sin with. So every time Sok Sin got a new car, he would
[00:15:31] pull it up to that same guard who'd been there for 20 years, guarding that gate, honk the horn,
[00:15:37] and wave at him. And so Sok Sin taught me a lot about Cambodia, probably just driving around with
[00:15:43] him. I learned as much as, you know, and he would see two young lovers on a motorcycle. And he was
[00:15:50] like, I cannot look. And I'd say, why? He goes, he goes, I missed that. I didn't get that in my life,
[00:15:56] like too painful, too painful. And it was just amazing what those people went through. And,
[00:16:04] you know, one of my students, a professor named now named Sopa Ear, his parents were sort of
[00:16:10] elite Cambodians, they pushed their Mercedes out because the Cameroon came in April 17 1975.
[00:16:16] They said, Oh, we're just leaving for a little while. The American bombers are coming, you know,
[00:16:21] we just so they're pushing their Mercedes, right? And one of the kids gets separated, never sees
[00:16:27] them again. And then the father dies, the men always die, the women survive, the Cambodian women
[00:16:32] kept that society together. Very similarly, how the southern women did after the Civil War. And
[00:16:39] but much more extreme anyway, they go to one of those horrible rice gulags where, you know,
[00:16:47] they're barely given enough calories to survive. And they announced, Okay, any Vietnamese, we're
[00:16:55] going to allow out. But you have to take this Vietnamese language exam. You fail that exam,
[00:17:02] you die. And so she had had Vietnamese maids. So they coached her got her Vietnamese backup to speed.
[00:17:10] She passed the exam. So now they go to a refugee camp in Vietnam. She finds a phone book. And I
[00:17:17] don't know how starts dialing numbers in Paris, gets a sponsor. They family gets to go to Paris.
[00:17:26] She works as a seamstress. Then she finds out she has a relative in San Jose or Oakland. They come
[00:17:33] to the United States. She makes sure that she gets a fake address in the best school district
[00:17:42] in San Francisco, makes her kids take the bus two hours each way. Every one of those kids today,
[00:17:49] doctor, PhD, you know, those are the immigrants we want, right? Yeah, no, we just, we just,
[00:17:58] we just did another podcast and we were talking to talking about some Vietnam, Vietnamese
[00:18:06] immigrants that came over after the war that had gotten out. And it was the same story for all of
[00:18:11] them. They'd all worked so hard. And all their kids ended up just, you know, doctors, you know,
[00:18:18] engineers, just the whole nine yards and because education was so highly valued for them
[00:18:22] after they were able to get out of Vietnam. And after, you know, basically everyone that they
[00:18:26] knew that stayed back was murdered. Oh, yeah. Awful, just awful how that unfolded.
[00:18:36] Let's rewind a little bit. We kind of jumped straight into Cambodia, but you took a strange
[00:18:39] path to get to Cambodia. So you're born in 1964. Yeah. That's kind of a cool time to be growing
[00:18:49] up and you grew up where in Malibu? Malibu Pacific Palisades. Yeah, Santa Monica Canyon.
[00:18:55] So this is like 19 year, what time did you start? How old were you when you started going down to
[00:19:00] Malibu by yourself and surfing all day, which I'm sure you must have done all the time. Well,
[00:19:05] we had a house in Carpenteria and then my grandpa lived at Rincon. So we were going to Santa Barbara
[00:19:12] pretty much like on the Rincon little point there, the cinderblock wall at the indicator.
[00:19:18] And that's how I met George Greno. You know, it was about 10 years old. And so I had a charmed life.
[00:19:24] I could go surf the Bixby Ranch and drive in and the Channel Islands. And I had a very charmed,
[00:19:31] I was, you know, I was a privileged kid and, and, you know, Malibu, I lived in the colony as a very
[00:19:39] little kid, then we moved away, but I still knew all those guys. So then I life guarded in Malibu
[00:19:44] colony, which was quite a quite an experience, but we were bad. So this is now the, so this is now
[00:19:50] what the 70s, when did you graduate from high school? 83. 83. And I was start like you said,
[00:19:57] going to Malibu with the older guys, smoking weed in the back of the pickup, you know, probably
[00:20:04] 13. What kind of music were you listening to? Led Zeppelin and cream. And yeah, that, you know,
[00:20:14] some eagles, but yeah. And, but yeah, we were bad. And we were like free range children. All
[00:20:21] our parents were divorced. Very permissive time. I mean, there was, especially in Malibu, bizarre,
[00:20:29] like one of our friends, mothers had a primal scream room that you like walk through a giant
[00:20:35] vagina to get into. And just bizarre seven. Wait, what's a primal scream? You have to expand on this
[00:20:42] one, bro. You go in this familiar. Yeah, you go in this room and you scream, and you let it all out.
[00:20:49] And, and then there was, you know, there was, there was orgies and this kind of stuff. So what
[00:20:55] are your parents doing at this point? Like my mom was making her way in Hollywood and my dad was
[00:21:00] were they together? No, they got and who are you living with? I lived with my mom till I was about
[00:21:06] 10. And then she knew I needed a dad and put me with my dad and my dad was a hard ass. Like I was
[00:21:14] bad. And, and he kind of he had a thing where he would wake you up at five in the morning. And then
[00:21:20] he'd say, come downstairs, we need to talk. And, and he was always the throw weight and all the
[00:21:26] union stuff in LA, because he owned all the buildings. So what he did with labor was how the
[00:21:33] strikes went everything. And he usually sided with labor. And so he would sit you down.
[00:21:39] And he would just inventory the litany of your sins that you didn't think you thought you were
[00:21:44] getting away with everything, right? And, and it was so startling. And, and then he would just
[00:21:51] handle you. Okay, this, yeah, this address, you need to be down there tomorrow morning at five.
[00:21:57] And it was the AFL CIO local 300. So you're going to get some? Yeah, Union Hall. And so he made me
[00:22:04] work as a union laborer on the high rises. But little did he know my, my, you know, this was the
[00:22:11] punishment job. And it was a graveyard shift 11 nights to six in the morning. But I worked with
[00:22:16] all Darrell strawberries family. So my marijuana empire expanded exponentially, because back then
[00:22:26] the there was green, there was green pot in the winter and brown pot in the summer and, you know,
[00:22:30] and tie. And the inner city LA couldn't get any of it. No one dared, you know, no white boys dared
[00:22:37] go down there. And so I did. And I go down, I go to Venice, because I knew some guys from the
[00:22:45] Venice gangs through athletics. And then I would go down the Crenshaw area with those guys. And I
[00:22:51] write about that in my book, tie stick. And then, yeah, and then I got, I got busted when I was 19.
[00:22:58] So hold on. So okay. So it seems like your dad, I mean, you your dad owns all these buildings.
[00:23:05] What what's what's getting you to you had to have looked at that even as a 15, 16, 17 year old
[00:23:12] and said, Hey, man, my dad's doing all right. I can probably figure out some kind of a livelihood
[00:23:17] by working with my dad. But how do you end up getting in the pop business?
[00:23:21] Um, I, I don't know. I just did. It was easy. It was right in front of me. The, you know,
[00:23:29] the surfers controlled the high end marijuana trade. And so particularly the tie trade. And so I,
[00:23:37] you know, wrote in tie stick that the arrival of the time marijuana fleet marked the beginning of
[00:23:42] summer. So the older surfers that I looked up to, and I would see these guys fly into Scorpion Bay,
[00:23:49] I mean, I first went to Scorpion Bay. I think it's 79. And it was guys on the lamb. I mean,
[00:23:54] it was a shady place and it was hard to get to. And so, you know, 16 years old crossing the mountains
[00:24:00] from the, from the sea of Cortez, you know, in my old man's suburban. And, and, you know, these
[00:24:07] guys would fly in for low tide and Cessna's and really good surfers. And then they, you know,
[00:24:12] they, they give us some cold beer because we didn't have ice, you know, like ice was the best commodity.
[00:24:18] And it's okay, we got to go back to Kabul for happy hour. And, you know, and they led this
[00:24:24] charmed life, you know, oh, North Shore in the winter, Indonesia, you know, in the summer,
[00:24:29] Baha in the summer. So these guys were on the endless, these guys were literally on the endless
[00:24:33] summer train fueled by marijuana financed by pot. Yeah. And so, so tie pot. So you said it was
[00:24:42] green. I forget what you said. I'm not familiar with pot because I spent my whole life well,
[00:24:48] I was in the military for 20 years. I grew up as like a straight edge hardcore kid. So,
[00:24:51] yeah, I don't know enough about pot. Well, now educate me. Yeah. Well, I call it Frankenweed
[00:24:58] now, like it's gone way beyond. We had the what we called purple seedless, which was the Northern
[00:25:04] California pot. Isn't that supposed to be good? Like California? Yeah, it was the best. Now,
[00:25:09] but it's this weird GMO pot that that's the Frankenweed. I don't like that stuff. And I don't
[00:25:14] think it's I don't think you should be smoking it all the time. So pot has has left me, you know,
[00:25:22] way behind. But anyway, so that would pretty much run out that. So it was a real Adam Smith supply
[00:25:27] and demand thing. So there was not unlimited amounts of good green pot all year round. So what's
[00:25:34] the brown pot that would be would be Mexican, Colombian inferior pot with seeds and this and
[00:25:41] that but then the ties were master growers and the famous tie stick, right? And so you had pot
[00:25:50] in the early 70s worth $2,000 a pound. And so one sailboat full, you're a millionaire, you know,
[00:26:00] and so that's why so many surfers got involved in it because what do surfers need? They need
[00:26:06] freedom and they need time. So one sailboat full, you're a millionaire and this is in the 70s. So
[00:26:12] that million you're good for a life. Yeah, exactly. And then, you know, then you go, I'll do another.
[00:26:18] Well, I'll do a bigger boat. Oh, you know, and then all of a sudden you're dealing with tie
[00:26:22] gangsters, you know, bringing it across the border and Pmax gas trucks, paying million
[00:26:28] dollar bribes. I mean, like, you know, remarkable tradecraft actually. And then that's where I
[00:26:34] learned a lot of tradecraft. You have this quote. So you wrote a book called ties to come to pull
[00:26:38] a quote from it right now. It says one afternoon a long haired well traveled surfer came into the
[00:26:45] surf shop and after exchanging warm greetings and elaborate handshakes with the shopkeeper,
[00:26:49] he threw a big plastic bag filled with greenish brown plant matter onto the counter and said,
[00:26:55] tie sticks, bro. That same summer, my friend found his older neighbor stash of tie sticks and stole one.
[00:27:02] So it was just like this seemed like the thing. You also had another good quote in there. The
[00:27:08] quest for utopia turned into self indulgence and narcissism. The beach was an escape, a constant
[00:27:14] and stable refuge during a time of uncertainty. This is like the 70s. Yeah, absolutely. And yeah,
[00:27:21] as I said, almost all of my peers, parents were divorced. And, you know, and luckily, athletics
[00:27:29] grounded me very much, right? What athletics? What were you doing? Baseball, basketball,
[00:27:33] football from five years old to 14 years old every season with the same guys, you know,
[00:27:41] Pop Warner. And, you know, we were the Palisades dolphins, light blue uniforms with dolphins on
[00:27:48] our helmets, about 40 blonde haired white boys. And our schedule was Watts, Crenshaw. And that
[00:27:57] wasn't even the bad teams like Pico Rivera, with these like these Mexican teams running the wishbone,
[00:28:03] you know, just like, what is this? Yeah, and we're in our dorky little, you know, Palisades
[00:28:10] dolphins, you know, but there were some great athletes who came out of the Palisades, Steve Kerr,
[00:28:15] Jay Schrader. So it was interesting because back then LA was not segregated. So we were,
[00:28:22] you know, we were going up against the best of the blacks had to offer the best the Mexicans had to
[00:28:28] offer. And we had a lot of mutual respect for each other through athletics. So what is it
[00:28:33] segregated now? I would say the LA riots changed things dramatically. And I saw with my younger
[00:28:40] half siblings, they didn't, you know, they stayed in their little, you know, enclave. Yeah. And it
[00:28:47] and it wasn't good, you know. And and then I, you know, then I went to private school and it was
[00:28:55] this is once you turn 14, 15 or whatever. Yeah. So I was public school until seventh grade,
[00:29:00] then I got sent to a very difficult prep school, despised it, fought at every step of the way.
[00:29:08] Did you have to wear a uniform and stuff? No, but just had to do about four hours of homework
[00:29:13] a night. And yeah, and you know, we fought a lot in public school. I mean, back then we all went
[00:29:19] to a park after school and played sports unsupervised always. And people fought all the time. And it
[00:29:25] was a very honest hierarchy. And and so I had a guy try to bully me at the private school.
[00:29:32] And I was like, Oh, you got to be kidding me. And so I waited for cross country running day.
[00:29:38] So we could get the furthest possible away from the coaches and then tripped him from behind. And
[00:29:43] then just just he and he and I let him bully me like I, you know, I, you know, from fighting a
[00:29:50] lot of its acting. And so I got him like, like salivating and and then, you know, I probably
[00:29:57] hit him 15 times in the face, unanswered. He didn't even put his hands up. And then no,
[00:30:04] no, but then he had, then he had like weird knots all over his head from that day forward. And I
[00:30:10] won't tell you his last name, but it begins with an L and his name, he became lumpy L after that
[00:30:17] day. And then nobody bothered me at private school anymore. And then I wasn't invited back
[00:30:23] because I'd been on academic probation and was starting to turn pretty bad by about 10th grade.
[00:30:28] And and then I went to a very, very fancy movie star kid, very permissive, very liberal school
[00:30:38] in Santa Monica. And, and that's where I really went back because I had some, I had an old buddy
[00:30:47] from sports, whose family were all big Crips. And so he was there as the basketball ringer.
[00:30:53] So they had this ringer basketball team. And so we were involved in all kinds of, you know,
[00:30:59] selling weed, charging people to park at their own high school. It wasn't pretty. And I wasn't nice.
[00:31:07] And what's your what's your dad doing during this? He's just working his ass off all the time.
[00:31:10] Working his ass off kind of has a new family, new wife. And, you know, I would they're just like,
[00:31:16] but they would say, Well, how's Peter doing? My dad said, Well, there's still sand in the house,
[00:31:21] so he's alive. And, and that was about it. And so then, yeah, I went, I was the only one who
[00:31:28] didn't go to college. I moved to Australia at 18 to surf and, and had an incredible time.
[00:31:35] You say this in the book, tie sticks are extreme confidence in the ocean often translated to
[00:31:40] dangerous sense of freedom and arrogance on land at 14. I was busted by customs at Tijuana border,
[00:31:45] trying to smuggle fireworks at 16. I was sneaking onto private government property to surf waves
[00:31:50] guarded by barbed wire fences, no trespassing signs, and men with guns at 19. I moved to Australia,
[00:31:55] never looked back. There was very little we were not willing to do if it enabled us to
[00:32:01] surf perfect, uncrowded waves, whether it was bringing a few cases of Canadian whiskey through
[00:32:07] this through the surf during prohibition, poaching some illegal Mexican lobsters from
[00:32:12] officers in Vegas, working on the gambling boats anchored in international waters off Santa Monica
[00:32:17] pier or offloading or offloading a load of Thai marijuana. California watermen had always been
[00:32:23] part of the black market. Fast money, fast money bought time and freedom. That's like a history
[00:32:29] of what surfers have been doing for the past since since the prohibition crying out loud.
[00:32:38] You say by 16, marijuana was my daily bread without which no surfing session was complete.
[00:32:45] Although there was a Western surfing association, a national scholastic surfing association,
[00:32:50] a Christian surfing association, and probably even a Republican surfing organization,
[00:32:54] my peers and I were members of the marijuana surfing association. Not all surfers smoked
[00:33:00] pots, some were adamantly opposed to it, but for us, pot and surfing went hand in hand.
[00:33:04] Not only was smoking anesthesia for that dulled life sharp edge, it was above all
[00:33:10] an effective time killer for our endless waiting, whether it was a swell to come, the tide to drop
[00:33:15] or the wind to change, we always seem to be waiting for something. You know, when one of the things
[00:33:21] that I tell people a lot and it seems like you're just knee deep in this, when you're young, you
[00:33:28] don't connect what you're doing right now with your future. And I think that's a huge problem.
[00:33:35] It leads kids to do the wrong things because they don't recognize that, oh,
[00:33:39] what I'm doing right now, this is going to impact my future, whether they're not thinking
[00:33:43] about their future or they don't think they can get caught or they think they can get away with
[00:33:46] anything or they think they're immortal, all those things. It seems like you were just knee
[00:33:50] deep into, hey, I'm living for the moment right now. That's it. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And I,
[00:33:57] it took a long time to repair the damage because I went to Australia.
[00:34:02] So, did you graduate from high school? Yeah. And then once you graduated from high school,
[00:34:09] now you're 18, 19 years old? No, no, I'm 18. So you're 18 years old and
[00:34:14] does your dad want you to go to college? Did you get good grades? No, but I was always working. I
[00:34:19] always had a couple jobs. So I was always, I had a union job or, you know, I was, I was,
[00:34:26] I was never lazy and I was always motivated just by not traditional things. And so I would work my
[00:34:35] ass off and then I would sell, you know, pot on top of that. But, you know, very kind of only pot,
[00:34:42] only to adults, only large quantities, never to kids or like a dealer. I really kind of frowned
[00:34:49] on that. And just saving all my money for the big surf trip, right? And so I did that for about
[00:34:58] 10 months after high school. Then I flew to Australia and I lived at Brokenhead Point between
[00:35:05] Byron Bay and Lenox Head with a famous old shaper named Michael Cundith. And George Greeno was our
[00:35:14] neighbor who I knew a little bit from Santa Barbara and it was just bliss. And I traveled all over
[00:35:20] Australia with some of the best surfers of the time. One of my best friends was a guy named
[00:35:24] Ant Corrigan who was the best surfer of his generation, schoolboy Cadet Champ. They wanted
[00:35:31] him on the pro tour. He went to work at the pub instead. And I loved the Aussies because they
[00:35:36] didn't care if you're a dick, you're a dick and they're going to call you out on it. And, you
[00:35:41] know, the pubs and the drinking and fighting and fighting and fighting. And, you know, it was a
[00:35:48] wild time, the Aussies. And I had a ball. And then I went to Micronesia, I surfed Micronesia, New
[00:35:57] Caledonia, Fiji before Tavaruea, then French Polynesia. And then I had a Tahitian girlfriend.
[00:36:07] And I thought I had died and gone to heaven. And I'm there and it just, it was too good. And then
[00:36:14] suddenly. So now are you 19 now? Yeah, I'm 19. You're 19 years old. Damn, that's, you're rolling.
[00:36:20] And so suddenly a strange car pulls up in the driveway. And I look. Okay, so you wait a second
[00:36:26] now. You're in Tahiti at this point. Yeah. You got a Tahitian girlfriend at her house. You're
[00:36:30] surfing, living the dream. Yeah. And you're in her house. Yeah. Living there, staying there. And
[00:36:38] now what do we get? Strange car pulls up. Fat middle age Frenchman jumps out. Eyes pop this far
[00:36:47] out of his head. Knocks me out of the way, runs straight for the bed, rips the sheets off the
[00:36:56] bed, starts smelling the bed like a dog. I run and grab my passport, whatever I can find and
[00:37:05] fucking leave half of my shit there and beat feet onto this street up in the hills above
[00:37:11] Papi Ate. And I'm just going like, what she said? She loved me. And so now I'm in the Kuei and
[00:37:19] Papi Ate. I check into some Tiji hotel. Turns out it has like a transvestite disco in it. And
[00:37:25] I was really pretty blonde haired surfer back then. And you know, and I'm basically, I had to
[00:37:30] barricade my door. And then I'm like, I gotta go. I'm going back to LA. So I get back to LA after
[00:37:37] about a year away. And I see my friends are basically sitting stoned in the same chairs I left them
[00:37:46] in a year earlier. And I had kind of a moment of satori and said, like, I'm out of here. I'm never
[00:37:53] living here again. And I'm getting as far away from this fucking place as I can. And so
[00:37:59] that's a weird thing to have, because it seemed like everything was kind of, I mean, other than this
[00:38:10] big French dude who kind of rolled in on your dreams. But you know, you could find another
[00:38:15] Tahitian girl or another girl or I mean, not one that was sponsoring me. That's good. That's
[00:38:21] good. So he was technically sponsoring your aspects. But you get back to LA. Okay, so your
[00:38:27] friends are still kind of stoned and they're surfing or whatever. But it's weird. It seems
[00:38:32] like that's an extreme viewpoint to suddenly have unless I guess the connection that I just was
[00:38:40] talking about where people don't understand that what they're doing now impacts their future.
[00:38:44] So that's probably what it was. You made this connection between, oh, I've been gone for a
[00:38:49] year and these guys are doing the same thing. And they're going to be doing that in five years.
[00:38:52] They're going to be doing that in 10 years. Oh, what I'm doing right now is going to impact my
[00:38:56] future. So maybe you did make that connection. Well, also, I had surfed such good waves and
[00:39:02] so many good waves. I mean, Lenox head back then, light crowds, the outer reefs of Cape
[00:39:10] Iron, you know, big waves, broken head point every day. So that I got back, I was like,
[00:39:17] okay, I'm going backwards now, like I've done all this. And so I found this college of small,
[00:39:24] another extreme liberal liberal arts school Bard College. And at that time, I think there were
[00:39:30] about 750 students. And they basically took your pulse and saw that your check cleared and you
[00:39:37] could get in. And so they had an immediate decision plan. So I flew back, I'd been in LA maybe four
[00:39:43] or five days, I found out about it, I flew to New York, I got in. Was it just timing wise? It
[00:39:49] happened to be in the fall or whatever, whenever they were accepting people. Yeah, August. Yeah,
[00:39:53] they had a they had a rolling admittance thing. And it was basically almost an art school and in
[00:39:59] a remarkable place. And it was up in the woods of New York state. And I got really into hunting
[00:40:06] and fishing. And so I just I fished at a trout stream on my college campus. And I fished and
[00:40:14] hunted every single day. And I had seven weeks off for Christmas, so I'd go to the North Shore
[00:40:21] every Christmas. And then I'd go to Scorpion Bay every summer. So I'd work in the unions, make money,
[00:40:26] and then go to Scorpion Bay. So I still got to surf a lot. But I became a pretty serious student.
[00:40:31] And it was not easy because I was damaged goods, because I hadn't done shit in high school. So
[00:40:37] I was, like you said, making up for these errors. And I was there with these, you know, really
[00:40:44] privileged kids from the East Coast. And like, for example, I had never, ever contemplated doing,
[00:40:51] you know, heroin or anything like that. The first time I even heard about it was on the East Coast
[00:40:57] with the most privileged children of America. And it was horrifying to me. And so I became a
[00:41:05] very, very serious student and had some incredible professors and wrote a really first rate thesis
[00:41:15] on my great grandfather's time at Nuremberg. Before we get there, it seems like you had a moment of
[00:41:21] clarity also when it came to the marijuana business. So in the book, tie sticks, you say,
[00:41:29] you get pulled over. And you say, the officer took one look at my bloodshot eyes, caught a
[00:41:35] whiff of the car's interior and asked, son, are you transporting narcotics across state lines?
[00:41:41] In that moment, under the dark desert sky, I told myself, if I got out of this jam, I would never
[00:41:46] put myself in this position again. Although I continued to smoke pot, I never trafficked again.
[00:41:51] So how did you get that? How did you get through that?
[00:41:56] You know, tradecraft on some level, I had, you know, I was like a half a pound or a quarter pound.
[00:42:05] And it was vacuum bagged and wiped down with the gas or some solvent in the cushion of the
[00:42:11] driver's seat. And it was a hatchback Mustang GT. And I'd been driving straight from LA and was
[00:42:20] all the way at the border of Texas and New Mexico. And I had two joints for the drive.
[00:42:27] And this was just for my personal consumption in college, because there was no good pot on these
[00:42:31] ghosts. And so, so I'm smoking my second joint, and I drop it on the ground. I turn on the
[00:42:39] interior light, I pass a cop going about 85, I don't even see him. And I see, you know, he lights
[00:42:46] so far back and say, oh, that can't be for me. And then I'm hit with a spotlight. And he's on the,
[00:42:52] on the PA going, keep your hands on the steering wheel and pull over to the start of the road.
[00:42:57] So I'm rolling down both windows, the Cheech and Chong shows going on. And I take a really long
[00:43:05] time to stop. And so, and he walks up. Yeah, no, he said, son, he said, there's a fruity,
[00:43:12] herbal aroma in the car and a brown stain on your lip. And I just said, no, sir, that's all I would
[00:43:19] say no sir. Okay, I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the car. Yeah, do I have consent to
[00:43:26] search. So I gave him the keys, hoping he would open it without, and he was too smart. So he said,
[00:43:32] he made me give him consent. And then he started pulling my bags out. And one had a bunch of blocks
[00:43:38] of white surfboard wax and up against the car. And he was sure it was like Coke or something.
[00:43:43] So then he kind of and then he's going through all my bags. And then I have these bundles of slides
[00:43:49] and brown paper with duct tape wrapped around him up against the car. And so he gets two big buildups,
[00:43:55] two strikes and now we're like 20 minutes into it. And he's an American Indian. And
[00:44:00] and and then finally he's he's you know, my my seats are still folded down. He hasn't folded the
[00:44:08] seats up. I have surfboards. I have all kinds of conversation. So he's asking me about this. And
[00:44:14] we he's kind of real. Okay, this guy's not that bad. And then and then he says, son, we're going to
[00:44:20] strike a little deal. And going, Oh, boy. And he goes, you're going to keep it under 55. While
[00:44:27] you're in New Mexico, and we're going to call it even. And that was the hardest part because I was
[00:44:32] going to jump in his arms. Oh, never do it again. And I really never did it again. And and that was
[00:44:40] that because I you know, I had I had made it over the Rubicon, you know, and I had turned my life
[00:44:46] around. But I almost fucked it up out of just, you know, arrogance and stupidity, you know,
[00:44:52] you track on any of the friends that you had back from that era.
[00:44:55] Absolutely. I'm still friends with all of them for better or worse. Yeah, all of them.
[00:45:00] Some surfed with them in Malibu yesterday. And you know, that some of them have been,
[00:45:06] you know, real heavy lifters when it comes to drugs, you know, like, they should
[00:45:10] take them to the Mayo Clinic and test them because from crack to fentanyl to and lost a lot of
[00:45:15] friends to fentanyl lost a lot of friends to opiates in the last few years. So fentanyl,
[00:45:22] fentanyl is a fake or a man made opioid. Is that what it is? Oh, yeah. Yeah. And it's what a
[00:45:30] thousand times stronger than or something. Do you know the actual number? How much? No, it depends
[00:45:35] on the ratio, but it's it's it's orders of magnitude. And you know, and it's in my opinion,
[00:45:43] asymmetrical warfare against the United States by China. And so the Chinese ship the chemicals
[00:45:49] to the Mexican cartels, they make them thanks to our porous border. It comes across. I mean, we had
[00:45:57] where do you get the like, what, where does this theory come from that the Chinese are sending
[00:46:02] the chemicals to Mexico? It's it's fairly well known because they would get American medical
[00:46:10] journals that had drug recipes that were too addictive that weren't ever approved. And and
[00:46:18] and whether it's I don't see it as as like Dr. Evil, you know, with his pinky in his mouth coming up,
[00:46:26] but look at the impact that it's had on America in last year, more Americans died than 108,000
[00:46:35] Americans died of ODs. So that's more than Korea, Vietnam and the war on terror combined.
[00:46:41] And nobody seems to be two up in arms about it. Is that one year? One year.
[00:46:46] 108,000. Yeah, according to the CDC, as a parent, that scares me more than anything.
[00:46:52] So the reason it scares you as a parent, because your kid can be at a party, and someone says,
[00:46:56] hey, you want to take some ecstasy, exactly, and they take ecstasy, but it turns out being
[00:47:01] fentanyl laced and they're dead. Yeah, and that happened in my town in North Carolina. The kid
[00:47:05] was a sports star getting ready to go to college, you know, senior party, let's take some ecstasy
[00:47:11] and boof. It happened some Naval Academy students, right? Yeah, some Naval Academy students in Florida
[00:47:16] down there partying. Yeah, a couple of them died. I mean, just like a horror. Yeah, it is. And to me,
[00:47:24] I mean, enforcing drug policies are difficult, but you know, and then you look at like Purdue
[00:47:32] Pharma and how the opiate crisis came to America and the corruption. I mean, that's at our core,
[00:47:42] that's the nation's problem now is just a kind of corruption I saw in Cambodia. And, you know,
[00:47:49] where, you know, Pelosi's husband's buying the stock that she's about to approve or Hunter's
[00:47:55] laptop or this kind of stuff. And it's a bipartisan game. I'm not, you know, I just, it's, you know,
[00:48:04] and like we were saying prior to the interview, everybody's in too deep with the Chinese to
[00:48:10] really call them out on anything. And our obsession with Russia is conspicuous to me compared to the
[00:48:17] blind eye we turned to China. Now with Taiwan, we're starting to firm up a little bit. But that's
[00:48:23] sleep. We're sleepwalking basically. And we're, you know, foreign policy has public relations.
[00:48:30] And to have the same neoconservatives back, like you, you know, so succinctly talk about,
[00:48:39] I forget your exact phrase, but, you know, taking responsibility for your failures. And
[00:48:45] extreme ownership, I think. And we look at these foreign policy elites that have just been wrong
[00:48:51] on wrong and wrong. And I've had moments where I got to write for the big periodicals and stuff
[00:48:58] like that. But I always went too far. And I always, I mean, I was all over Soros's guys during the
[00:49:05] 90s because they were utopians. Oh, the international criminal court with universal jurisdiction.
[00:49:11] It's like, well, we kind of tried that Woodrow Wilson and it didn't work out so well. And all
[00:49:17] those people went on to huge positions, you know, Ben Rhodes, Samantha Powers, these were
[00:49:22] cub reporters. These are my peers. And, you know, you played ball, you got tapped, you got pushed
[00:49:28] to the head of the class. And so I was in the odd position where I was critical of the war on terror
[00:49:35] from a policy perspective and thought it could have, you know, particularly when it went to Iraq
[00:49:40] because I had friends at the Army War College that I would call and say, what really impressive guy,
[00:49:47] Lieutenant Colonel Conrad Crane, who was Petraeus's brain, really. And he was the
[00:49:52] author of the counterinsurgency manual. And, you know, and he said, yeah, Tom Warwick from the
[00:49:58] State Department, who I had argued with about war crime stuff. He said he wrote the whole
[00:50:04] occupation plan. They had it like eight volumes. And Rumsfeld said, Warwick State Department,
[00:50:10] chuck it. And so people on the inside were nervous and kind of going like, wow, we don't
[00:50:17] really know where this is going, but it's going. And, and, you know, like, you know, worse than a
[00:50:25] an error is a blunder. And it's kind of blundering. And, you know,
[00:50:30] yeah, I would say worse than an error is to not assess your situation. Exactly. Oh, yeah. You
[00:50:37] know what? I was wrong about this. And here's the adjustments we need to make now. Yeah. And it took
[00:50:42] so long to, for any kind of that type of recognition that it was ridiculous. And then Libyan and
[00:50:49] Syria and keep rolling, you know, and now work this time. And by the way, you know, you can go
[00:50:54] all the way back to Vietnam, you can look at the exact, it's just the exact same thing. It's the
[00:50:58] exact same thing in Vietnam. Everything that was going on. It's like, Oh, the generals only listen
[00:51:04] to the politicians only listen to the generals and the generals only listen to themselves.
[00:51:07] Yeah. And no one's actually talking to the troops on the ground that know what's happening and
[00:51:11] could actually devise a way to move forward in a positive way. Doesn't happen. No freaking ridiculous.
[00:51:22] All right. So going back to going back to little tangential discussions, all good.
[00:51:27] Going back to you. So you end up in college, you go into this barred, barred college, and you're,
[00:51:34] you're having a good time. You enjoy it. Yeah. And you so talk to me about your your master's
[00:51:41] thesis. Well, no, just undergraduate. Okay. And I won a bunch of awards. So what was it?
[00:51:48] I was on the Nuremberg trials and the secret release of the convicted Nazis
[00:51:52] to trade to get German rearmament. Basically, the Germans say, and the Germans were masterful,
[00:51:58] you know, and I mean, statecraft, come on, we're going to beat them. And they said, Oh,
[00:52:03] you have to release our prisoners of war if you want a German army. And now, you know,
[00:52:08] with the Soviet Union seeming to be menacing in Europe, Berlin splitting. And the Germans are
[00:52:18] pouring gas on it, you know, and so hit one of Hitler's best spy masters on the Soviet Union,
[00:52:25] Reinhard Galen, he took all their records on the Soviet Union, buried them and then surrendered
[00:52:31] to the US. And he said, Okay, you want that? You get all my guys off the war crimes list.
[00:52:37] And yeah, we'll give you all the intelligence you want on the Soviet Union. So they flew Galen at
[00:52:42] Al to the United States. And he would he would kind of hype up the Soviet threat to keep the
[00:52:49] Americans, you know, on their heels. And, and so the Germans masterfully manipulated us. And we
[00:52:57] wound up freeing some of the worst German war criminals like some of the Einsatz commandos,
[00:53:03] Einsatzgruppen who followed the Wehrmacht, and we're just pure executioners. And, and so,
[00:53:09] you know, that was quite alarming. When I was younger, I was a little more idealistic before I
[00:53:17] did field work. And, and so I then, and it was an interesting so that that became my PhD advisor
[00:53:25] dissertation. So then I went to Columbia to study with Brigadier General Telfer Taylor,
[00:53:30] who was the chief prosecutor, scary guy. And there's scary in what way there's a, well, he,
[00:53:37] I think he argued, I don't know how many Supreme Court cases. There's a famous movie called The
[00:53:43] Paper Chase about law school. And John Hausman is this really, yeah, he was John Hausman times 10.
[00:53:50] And, and, and if you went off topic talking to him, he would just close his book on it. So I see
[00:53:57] we're finished today. And that was it, you were dismissed. And, you know, and old fashioned law
[00:54:04] school, you go Jones, tell me about the Smith Act. And you get two shots the whole semester. And if
[00:54:11] you blow it, that's half your grade. And so, wait, so this is Columbia Law School? Well, I got my
[00:54:18] PhD in history, but I also took classes in law school, and the School of International Affairs,
[00:54:24] and had some incredible professors. And, and it was horrible. I hated every minute of it.
[00:54:31] I'm so glad I did it now. But it was, you know, like being locked in a boxcar for four years or
[00:54:39] something. I mean, what was your vision at that time for your life? Like, what did you see yourself
[00:54:43] doing? Did you want to go into journalism? Did you want to be a professor? What did you want to do?
[00:54:47] I thought I was going to go to law school. And then I got my master's in history. I wrote another
[00:54:53] thesis another one another step further on Nuremberg. And then I got into Columbia Law School,
[00:55:00] Journalism School, and History. And they, they, at that point, you're kind of a professional
[00:55:05] athlete. So you get no tuition, you get money, and all that in the history. And then I kind of
[00:55:12] pitted them all against each other. And I got the best deal from history. And I was still not
[00:55:18] totally committed to academia. I just, you know, was getting a free PhD. And I, I really enjoyed
[00:55:25] it. And I was going to write a book. And so I think it was journalism more moving in that direction.
[00:55:30] But, but I was always kind of more active person. I didn't want to just sit on the sidelines. And
[00:55:36] then the opportunity came as I finished to go to Cambodia. And it was what I wanted to do.
[00:55:43] So, so how'd that opportunity spring up? As I said, these two guys I grew up with in, in,
[00:55:50] in California, were photographers for agency France Press, they stumbled across the cash
[00:55:57] of negatives at Tool Slang Prison. And they set up a secret darkroom and we're printing them and,
[00:56:04] and really preserving the original negatives, the evidence of, of war crimes. And that I, I knew
[00:56:11] that's the key though, punishing the individuals is obviously important, but creating an empirical
[00:56:18] record of the crimes. That's what's made Holocaust revisionism so difficult. Because
[00:56:25] Nuremberg created an unassailable historical record. So that's where my mind was, I didn't think that
[00:56:33] they would ever try anybody. And it will, and in fact, they did. And I played a small role in
[00:56:41] keeping those issues alive, preserving the evidence and passing that evidence on to the Cambodian
[00:56:47] documentation center. And I worked closely with them as I went further on. And so what year is
[00:56:55] this now? So this would be 94 is my first trip. And then when did you go side note? When did you
[00:57:04] start training Jiu Jitsu? I was training in Jeet Kune Do first with a guy named John Peretti in
[00:57:12] New York City, who was a former pro kickboxer, and a real badass who fought on Indian reservations and
[00:57:20] was fighting like MMA matches in the tunnels beneath Chinatown. And before the era of closed
[00:57:28] circuit TV, he had those ASIC Tiger shoes, and he was so steel toes in them. And, and, and, you know,
[00:57:37] and we get in all kinds of fights in New York City and beat up bad people. And he encouraged us to do
[00:57:43] that. And, and, and, and John Donahue was kind of around a bit at that time. And so I was, you
[00:57:52] know, I was training with Freddie, a lot of kickboxing. And he was a real, a very brilliant guy,
[00:57:59] an odd guy, very sadistic in his training. Everything was live full contact. And he would
[00:58:05] bring in incredible fighters that he knew he brought in a sumo wrestler, Igor Zanoviev, who fought
[00:58:13] a beat Mario Sperry, we met him when he had just come. And he was fighting underground fights.
[00:58:19] A Russian fencer who is the fastest human I've ever seen, only in one direction. And, you know,
[00:58:27] small arms stuff and all kinds of different things. And, and we were all kind of scared of
[00:58:33] wrestlers. And, and Peretti talked about fighting this Russian wrestler, who almost broke his neck
[00:58:40] and killed him in the first round of their challenge match. And then he knocked him out so
[00:58:45] unconscious that he thought he killed him in the second round. But that left a big mark. So, so he
[00:58:51] never, he encouraged us to finish our fights on the hardwood floor. And, and so we had no mats.
[00:58:58] And, and, and not many people lasted that long in that school. And, and then I heard about the
[00:59:06] Garcia brothers, the Mexican guys, the Garcia brothers. And, and that was, that was the Gracie's.
[00:59:15] And so then I had a friend who was a college wrestler and he said, oh yeah, I'm training with,
[00:59:21] with Hicks and Gracie and on Pico. And so you came back out to California. I come every summer.
[00:59:27] So when you spent your summer in California, you got to, that's the first time you went down to
[00:59:32] Pico. Yeah, I went first time. I think 92, I got a private. And then Hicks and said, come back,
[00:59:40] you know, come back and really train. And so then the next summer I trained, you know, three days a
[00:59:45] week in the men's, open men's daytime class. And my friend used to say it was, it was lunchtime on
[00:59:54] the prison yard. And it was, you know, we had Eric, 94, 95, no 93, 93. So this was Eric Paul
[01:00:02] Wilson. John Lewis was in there as a wipeout. And, and as I said in the book, like, they were minor
[01:00:12] compared to like guys like you, then there was like prison extraction unit guards that were so big.
[01:00:20] And the, the gnarliest guy was an offshore oil rig, like pull a pipe joiner guy was like 300 pounds.
[01:00:29] And he would just grab a wrist and like peel, they just take things. And yeah, Paul Vunak was in there.
[01:00:37] And then just all the karaoke Brazilian Rio guys coming here and coming there. And, and, and I
[01:00:44] surfed well and they knew me from surfing. So they liked that. And I was a good standup fighter.
[01:00:48] So, and we had to do a lot of standup back then and Luis LeMau would put on these, these ridiculous
[01:00:54] leather boxing gloves and, and I do my Bruce Lee stuff and they all like Hicks and kids thought it
[01:01:00] was the best, you know, and, and, and it was a great time, you know, and, and Hicks and I became good
[01:01:07] friends. And not that deep. But then we both kind of had a pivotal moment in both of our lives. And
[01:01:16] it was when I was going to start in Cambodia, and he was going to fight in Japan. And we would run
[01:01:23] into each other at sunrise at Malibu. And just there's Hicks and Hey, Hicks and, and we talk,
[01:01:28] you know, for an hour. And, and I don't think I've had any superficial conversations with Hicks and
[01:01:36] in 30 years. And it's always straight to the guts of it. And then I started, you know, going to Cambodia
[01:01:44] and a lot of times I would come straight back from a gnarly trip, right to his house, always
[01:01:52] unannounced in the same clothes I've been wearing, smelling like wood smoke and kind of spun out on
[01:01:59] volumes and beers and because you can't sleep after you get that wound up, right. And, and he'd take
[01:02:06] one look at me and he'd go, take off your boots. And he said, let's play around a little bit. And
[01:02:13] he wouldn't even let me start my show and tell. And then I'd have like a two hour private in, in
[01:02:17] like street clothes. And then he'd say, okay, like, what the fuck happened to you on this one? And so
[01:02:25] and then I would tell him these like these martial arts scenarios, like fighting on motorcycles,
[01:02:30] I got attacked on motorcycles once. And, and like had a full 3040 mile an hour fight on motorcycles
[01:02:38] with three guys trying to pull me off and we made them crash. And then a lot of mob stuff. And as
[01:02:44] I was saying earlier, this is all in Cambodia. Yeah, in Cambodia, like in gosh, I don't know,
[01:02:51] I think about 99. They attack the Cambodian government orchestrated mobs that attacked the
[01:02:57] Thai embassy. And the Thai ambassador had to escape in a speedboat. And any Thai business was ransacked
[01:03:04] by kind of government orchestrated mobs, icons, but in plain clothes, Molotov cocktails. And,
[01:03:12] and I was always saying earlier, I really began to see the mob as this like organic organism that,
[01:03:19] you know, feeds on the sound of broken glass and the smell of fire. And, and they were all on
[01:03:26] motorcycles. And they would the military police would come and disperse them. And then you'd hear
[01:03:33] the beep, beep, beep, beep, and they'd all honk their horns and they'd reform up. And it went on
[01:03:39] and it went on all night. And you'd hear the beep, beep, beep. And then, and this was my wife's first
[01:03:44] trip to Cambodia. So you're bringing your wife on these trips? No, this was supposed to be a Mello
[01:03:50] one. Okay. Yeah, I said, Oh, no, it's Mello. It's not bad anymore. And this brings up out of nowhere.
[01:03:55] And, and this we were in the capital this time. And I was not expecting much. And she goes, Oh,
[01:04:01] look, fireworks. I go, those are tracers. And, and so, and it was a remarkable thing. You know,
[01:04:10] that really stuck with me of, of, and I think, as a society, we're moving towards this point of,
[01:04:18] of, you know, this mob gets kind of the military police heard them down this narrow street. And so
[01:04:25] they're, they're like five abreast all in those little motorcycles, two or three guys on the
[01:04:30] motorcycle. And they're kind of street punks, right? And there's three military policemen,
[01:04:36] all hard old, probably former Khmer Rouge guys, dark skin, which is typically the, you know,
[01:04:44] the Khmer Rouge guys are more peasant areas. And, and they block them off and they all have AKs old
[01:04:51] banged up AKs. And they walk up and the lead punk and the lead cop go nose to nose and the
[01:04:59] car and the punks going, and you see, and I'm on a balcony second floor right above it. And,
[01:05:06] and the, and the lead cop plays really passive. Oh yeah. Okay, man, I'm sorry. And he, and he
[01:05:13] wheels around, takes two steps back, nods to his guys, whips it around from the hip. They all open
[01:05:20] up 30 round magazines, foot over the heads of the, of the mob, reload those guys, leave their bikes,
[01:05:31] run each other over, it turns into complete Keystone cops. They turn into the biggest bunch
[01:05:36] of cowards you've ever seen in your life. And then I went out on the balcony and started clapping.
[01:05:41] And, you know, but yeah, and I just, I think, yeah, it was had a profound impact on, you know,
[01:05:51] on the mob and the cowardice of the mob when someone has the courage to stand up to the mob.
[01:05:57] What was the initial thread that you caught onto for going to Cambodia?
[01:06:02] Uh, was in my mind, this was the worst unaccounted for atrocity since World War Two.
[01:06:13] This was the event that, that destroyed the never again promise that made the whole never again,
[01:06:21] we're not going to be bystanders to genocide, mythical. And, and I said, how and why did this
[01:06:28] happen? And that's what made me go. That's why I wanted to start there. Then Bosnia happened.
[01:06:34] And then I'm in the foreign correspondence club watching Rwanda and Rwanda is just on a magnitude
[01:06:40] that, you know, is like Cambodia. And so these things are flaring up all around us. The UN sending
[01:06:47] forces doing the same bullshit neutrality thing. You had the French foreign legion in Cambodia,
[01:06:53] generals, Laurie Dan and redo said unleashes war is our business. We'll go fight these guys and
[01:07:00] they wouldn't take them off the leash. And both, both generals resigned. You had the Aussie SAS,
[01:07:06] you had real serious guys, but they'd send the Bulgarians. They'd send, you know, I mean, the
[01:07:12] the most lasting legacy of the UN in Cambodia was eight because they took soldiers from all over the
[01:07:19] world, put them all over the country. And that was their mode and UN land cruisers that the Khmer Rouge
[01:07:25] all stole. And they would just steal them at gunpoint. And one of the guys that I hired a ex
[01:07:31] Khmer Rouge guy, he would then sell them back to the UN. He would be the negotiator for them to buy
[01:07:37] back their own cars. And it was just weakness upon weakness. Yeah, you say in facing death in
[01:07:44] Cambodia, your book, you say, I began research, I began the research that would make this book
[01:07:48] possible in 1993. I was completing my PhD dissertation at Columbia University on the Nuremberg
[01:07:52] war crime trials and laws of war. The dissertation was awarded honors, but it was cold comfort.
[01:07:58] I felt hollow and fraudulent like a boxing commentator who had never been in the ring.
[01:08:04] I was writing about modern conflict as a civilian leading a secure life and an Ivy League university
[01:08:10] 28 and a product of one of the softest generations in American history. What did I know about conflict
[01:08:17] resolution, resolution beyond what I had read to teach undergraduates about how the world should be
[01:08:22] without addressing the rapidity changing the rapidly changing world on its own terms was to
[01:08:28] perpetuate a familiar cycle of fraudulence. So you were going to go get in it. Yeah.
[01:08:38] Then so so as Campbell, the first time you went to Cambodia, like how much intel did you gather
[01:08:44] the first time you went there? I saw that it was that the UN had done nothing about accountability.
[01:08:54] I saw that the the evidence of war crimes and genocide and all that was in the wind that,
[01:09:01] you know, I mean, we're finding stuff, you know, from third parties. I got a bunch of material
[01:09:07] in East Germany because the East Germans came in with the Vietnamese military. So there was no kind
[01:09:15] of it was catch as catch can. So my main imperative initially was to preserve the historical evidence.
[01:09:21] And I was a historian with a background in war crimes. And so, you know, when I went to Telfer
[01:09:26] Taylor and said, who do you think I should do this? He looked at me like, were you, you know,
[01:09:31] are you stupid? What did you study all this stuff for? And my grandfather, when I went the pilot,
[01:09:37] when I went to tell him, hey, I'm going to go to Cambodia, you know, he said, yeah, great,
[01:09:41] don't be careful, careful kills. And so nobody in my family thought it was the least bit strange,
[01:09:50] you know, so that, you know, my dad's half sister, Marty Hoy would have been the first
[01:09:58] woman to climb Everest, I think in 82. And her waist belt ended and she fell 5000 vertical feet,
[01:10:04] and they never found her body. And she was probably the greatest female mountain climber of all time.
[01:10:10] My uncle sailed like a 29 foot boat from Ventura Harbor to the Marquesas and spent like six years
[01:10:19] sailing around the world. So we get it honest, you know. And so I don't know, you know, it's just
[01:10:25] as normal. Now at some point, you know, when you're working the Cambodia case, you start
[01:10:33] pulling the thread on James Clark, Lance McNamara, Mike Deeds, and Crystal Lance. Yeah.
[01:10:39] And that's tell us about those guys. Well, I had friends from the marijuana trade who said, hey,
[01:10:47] these guys we knew vanished in Cambodia. And we never we don't know what happened, see if you
[01:10:53] can find any records, see if you can find anything about them. And, and I found one of their pictures
[01:11:03] in the prison, white guy, you know, surfer. And, and that was, you know, that was something I could
[01:11:09] identify with had I been 10 years older, it could have been me, I would have probably done that at
[01:11:14] that time. So that and then I met the families, you know, and, and that, I think, and that's the
[01:11:23] thing also that leads us into the Miag was I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, but
[01:11:27] nothing is more damaging and traumatizing to a family than having a family member disappear
[01:11:36] and not knowing how, what, when, and not being able to tie that up and to see the the trauma that
[01:11:45] the family goes through as a result, alcoholism, suicide, all those kind of things, you know, really
[01:11:52] followed a lot of the Westerners who were captured by the Khmer Rouge. How were these guys rolled
[01:11:57] up initially? Sailboat just got too close. And those disputed islands off of Cambodia, the Vietnamese
[01:12:06] and Cambodians were always fighting over. So they had Pete, they had fat American fast boats, they
[01:12:12] had armed fishing boats. So they were patrolling that stretch of water and, and, and very vigilant
[01:12:19] about it. And so, um, yeah, so that that was it. And they just, you know, got it got their boats,
[01:12:28] took them in, took them to Toul Slang prison, interrogated and tortured them for, you know,
[01:12:34] gosh, the last two who died, you know, there was days before the Vietnamese liberated Cambodia. So,
[01:12:43] you know, but they were three months or something, you know, just horrible tortures and, and
[01:12:48] and rewriting their confessions over and over and over and long 30, 40, 50 page confessions.
[01:12:55] And, you know, and, and that's the thing. And that's, you know, you see that at, at a certain
[01:13:01] point with torture, it doesn't work. So, well, it's crazy that the, that the Khmer Rouge decided
[01:13:10] to photograph everyone before they tortured and killed them. Yeah. Did you ever, what compelled
[01:13:16] them to do that? They were so paranoid that they had to prove to the leadership that they were
[01:13:24] carrying out their orders. And the remarkable thing about that prison is there were roughly like
[01:13:29] 1200 guards and staff members, something like 500 of them wound up as prisoners. One guy screamed,
[01:13:39] had a bad dream in the night and screamed, you're a CIA. One guy broke an axe handle, you're KGB. I mean,
[01:13:47] you know, this is Stone Age communism. And basically, they're all spying on each other,
[01:13:54] they're all snitching on each other. They would have these meetings. And, and one guy I interviewed
[01:14:01] was one of the head executioners named Him Hoi. And I was prepared to meet evil incarnate. And he
[01:14:08] was rumored to have killed thousands with the, with the ox cart axle to the back of the neck.
[01:14:14] And so I said, you know, I've been interviewing him and a couple of Marlboro Reds and Tiger beers,
[01:14:21] always kind of loosened him up a little bit. And he said, you know, I said, how did you,
[01:14:27] how did you get it to a sling prison? He said, well, I, they showed up in my village, you know,
[01:14:32] and you were drafted at gunpoint. And I ran away. And then I, they came back to my village. I ran
[01:14:39] away again. And the second time they sent me to the front. And my first battle, I was shot in the
[01:14:45] head. And they said, Oh, you're going to die so over the top, you lead the charge, you get shot a
[01:14:50] bunch more times. He recovers from that. And then during the invasion of Peno Pente, he gets a grenade
[01:14:59] dropped on him. And I say, wow, you know, were you afraid you were going to die? He goes, no, I was
[01:15:03] afraid that I was going to get captured. And they were going to eat my liver in front of me. So he
[01:15:08] crawls under a house survives that. And they say, Oh, comrade, hoy, you're such a valiant warrior,
[01:15:15] we have a special job for you. And they send him to a sling. So he starts out as a low level guard.
[01:15:21] Then his boss is accused. He becomes a prisoner. He moves up the food chain. And so his superior
[01:15:28] is keep getting killed. So suddenly he's one of the head guards, he's driving the truck to the
[01:15:33] killing fields at Chiang Ak. And, you know, and I said something to the effect of like, do you
[01:15:39] feel bad about it? Or some stupid question like that? And he just looked at me goes, it was death
[01:15:44] either way. And, and, you know, and it was remarkable in that he his whole life now is about
[01:15:55] penance. And, you know, because I would say that these guys like, Oh, do you think it's important
[01:16:00] that Pol Pot has tried and we hold them accountable and all this rah, rah, Western human rights
[01:16:06] bullshit. And they would say, No, not really at all. I think they should dig a big hole and bury
[01:16:12] all of it. Because vengeance breeds vengeance. And that's very Buddhist, right? But then they would
[01:16:17] say, What does it matter? He's 70 years old. He's only going to live 10 more years. He's coming back
[01:16:23] for 15,000 lives as a cockroach. So he's going to get his. So their thing is you're reincarnated as
[01:16:32] the lowliest horrible creature on earth for the next 10,000 years. So anything we can do
[01:16:39] in our earthly timeframe is immaterial to them. So that was interesting, you know, that really,
[01:16:47] and that the guy who probably had a bigger, more profound effect on me was one of the survivors,
[01:16:57] a guy named Imchaun. They kept him alive because he could have carved effigies of Pol Pot.
[01:17:02] Sure. He was a good artist. Yeah, he was a good artist. Figured out that he was a good artist.
[01:17:05] Yeah. And, and I same thing, first trip, Oh, isn't this great? Never again. We're going to get you
[01:17:12] justice and, and, and he kind of, and he cracked and he said, You know what? I'm only talking to you
[01:17:19] because the museum director told me to and I don't like talking to you guys. And every time I talk to
[01:17:26] you, you shorten my life. I think that they should take all this crap and dig a big hole and bury
[01:17:34] it and tear down this prison because vengeance reads vengeance. And then I turned off my tape
[01:17:40] recorder said, Okay, see you later. And I could have easily spun that and gone, you know, never
[01:17:47] again, rah, rah, rah, and gotten a big check from George Soros. But I really, it put me on my heels.
[01:17:56] And I thought, what cold comfort that we're, we're going to come in like the white nights
[01:18:02] after the genocide and hold a couple old guys up accountable. And at this time, you've got Rwanda
[01:18:08] going on, you've got Bosnia going on. I mean, during the former Yugoslavia war, they're indicting
[01:18:15] people with an ongoing conflict where there's massive atrocities being carried out and they're
[01:18:21] not even doing anything Rwanda the same East Timor. And these are just blowing up all over the
[01:18:27] place and the UN's taking this very passive, you know, non interventionist, even when they have
[01:18:33] forces on the ground, they don't take them off the leash. And so the whole thing seemed very
[01:18:41] fraudulent to me. I went to the Hague a couple of times and, you know, and you know, again,
[01:18:47] I call it the human rights industry. It's an industry. And when I started in the whole war
[01:18:53] crimes thing, I was one of about three people, nobody was in this field. And then it becomes
[01:18:59] this booming industry with the Hague with all these institutes and places at different universities.
[01:19:06] And I've worked on a lot of these high profile cases because I have subject matter expertise,
[01:19:12] but I can't take money or I'm a partisan. So I've walked a strange line in my career, you know,
[01:19:21] where, you know, I worked on the Jose Padilla, the dirty bomber case, I worked on the David Irving
[01:19:26] case, I worked in the Cameroon case. And, you know, and I sort of, you know, run afoul of everyone
[01:19:33] over the years. And it's funny because books are like children. They make their own friends.
[01:19:39] So I thought, oh, the New York Times, the polite society, they're going to all love me.
[01:19:44] No, they hated me. And, and it was the professional military and the far left became my best
[01:19:53] constituents, you know, and my first book, how was that?
[01:19:59] I, you'd have to ask them, this is this is Lawn War. You're telling me your first book.
[01:20:03] Yeah, Lawn War is an interesting book because that took me 10 years to get published. And
[01:20:09] it got rejected by a lot of publishers. And I would get they take your book, they send it out to
[01:20:16] the experts in the field. And I would always get one really good review, and then one really bad
[01:20:21] review, because basically I said, Nuremberg trials, if anything drew the Germans together
[01:20:28] in their defense of the Third Reich, it was the Marshall plan, it was economic prosperity.
[01:20:34] That's what converted them to see the era of the Third Reich. And the era of the Third Reich,
[01:20:40] the key players are the children of the people who lived through the Third Reich, the 68er generation
[01:20:47] comes of age and say, Dad, what did you do in the war? So that was you say the 68 or January?
[01:20:53] Yeah, the 68ers is, you know, like 68 was a big year of, of strife in the United States.
[01:21:00] Oh, so people that were born in 19, yeah, like the kind of lefties of, yeah. And so
[01:21:05] that generation, that's when that society began to reckon with its past. It was not in the 50s.
[01:21:12] So that was a very unwelcome message. But then a German historian, a guy by the name of Juerg
[01:21:21] Friedrich, he was one of my reviewers. And he said, Oh, yeah, of course, we all know this, this
[01:21:26] should be published, blah, blah, blah. And then my second guy sent me the most scathing criticism
[01:21:32] of anything I've ever written. And I, I, and Friedrich called me, huh, McGuire, oh, great job,
[01:21:38] blah, blah, I said, it's done. I'm they, I didn't get the contract. He said, what? And he sent,
[01:21:44] he said, send me the guy's review. So then he went through the guy's review and ripped it apart
[01:21:49] and got me hired by Spiegel TV in Germany. So then he introduced me to ad now ours, war crimes,
[01:21:57] advisors, the German defense attorneys, Flohten Richter, Otto Kronzbühler, who was
[01:22:04] doonits and crops defense attorney. And this guy was ad now ours, special, you know, advisor on
[01:22:12] the war crime stuff. So in the treaty, restoring German sovereignty in the 50s, where they're kind
[01:22:19] of let off probation in this gigantic thousands of page treaty, he inserts these paragraphs
[01:22:27] that invalidate all the post war war crimes trial decisions, the legal validity is rejected. And,
[01:22:35] and I would know one would ever found it out. But he said, look, I wrote it in invisible ink.
[01:22:41] I put the exception before the rule. No good lawyer would ever do that. And so that's,
[01:22:48] I had that in my book. And that was not happily received. So yeah, so I was, so that was a difficult,
[01:22:55] you know, 10 years knowing that you're right, but you got to fight and fight and fight.
[01:23:02] And then the book got published. And yes, that's the book that the military liked in the left
[01:23:07] like, but the polite society sure didn't like it. But they didn't, they couldn't really come after me
[01:23:13] because they hadn't done the heavy lifting. Like I said, their analysis of the Nuremberg trials
[01:23:20] never went deeper than Robert Jackson's opening address. It's this mythic myth of Nuremberg
[01:23:26] as this redemptive thing. And so yeah. And then what about what about death facing death in Cambodia?
[01:23:34] So that one get received? Pretty well, actually. Yeah, that one, that one I did better. But still,
[01:23:40] it and I mean, is the end what's your takeaway from, you know, vengeance breeds vendors? Is that
[01:23:47] your takeaway from that whole thing? Hey, bury this stuff in a hole and let's move on. No,
[01:23:53] definitely not. But I think what, what really came home for me was that you have to talk to the
[01:24:00] culture that, that survived this, that endured this, you can't come from the high and parachute
[01:24:08] down from the Hague. And that's what they did in Cambodia. And so when they finally, you know,
[01:24:14] they, they took more time to try for 80 year old Khmer Rouge leaders than it took to try thousands
[01:24:24] of war criminals after World War Two. And, and you know, I don't know how many millions they spent,
[01:24:30] the numbers are impossible to tell. And, and they got involved in what I call therapeutic
[01:24:35] legalism, which is we need closure and healing. And, and you can't ask a court to do that. And
[01:24:43] then they point to Nuremberg and say, look, look, Nuremberg did that, which is a myth. And so
[01:24:49] to ask a court to do anything more than punish the guilty and exonerate the innocent is too much.
[01:24:55] And so all of this, you know, therapeutic legalism and you burden it with, with victims units and
[01:25:03] all this kind of emotional stuff. And that's the world we live in now where, you know, this, these
[01:25:10] notions of comfort and safety. And I, I have a very kind of different view of it. And I believe
[01:25:20] that, that freedom isn't safe, you know, the lambs freedom safe, if you want this kind of timid,
[01:25:28] little bleeding freedom. But the lion's freedom is a bold thing. And if the lion breaks its leg,
[01:25:34] the hyenas get it. And that's the game, you know, so you don't get it both ways. And I don't, and I'm
[01:25:40] very uncomfortable with the direction American society is going now with, you know, this note,
[01:25:45] and that's why I don't teach anymore. Because, and I love teaching, it was very fun. But it turned
[01:25:51] into this notions of, Oh, well, you know, you know, I don't feel safe, I don't feel comfortable,
[01:25:57] I can't teach the Holocaust and Khmer Rouge, and you be comfortable. What is that? So I'm very
[01:26:03] socratic in the way I taught in that, you know, you don't raise your hand, I call on you. And,
[01:26:11] and you know, and that's keep some reading and keeps them on their toes. And I would walk in
[01:26:16] when I taught at Columbia with three by five cards. And I'd say, okay, take one, pass it down,
[01:26:23] and they kind of be giggling. And then I'd say, fold it in half. And they go, Oh, arts and crafts,
[01:26:28] I go write your name on it, I can't be bothered to remember your name. Smith, why are you here?
[01:26:35] Smith stock tips, sports scores, talk, and just boom, fast and make them all talk. And just like
[01:26:42] you dealt with in buds, by the end of that first class, they were bound together as a unit in terror.
[01:26:50] And, and then, and then, you know, but then once that class was over, they go, Professor
[01:26:59] McGuire, I go, No, it's Peter said, that was a fucking show. I said, you call on me anytime you
[01:27:05] need a letter of recommendation, anything, you know, you survive, man, I'm yours for the rest of
[01:27:11] your life. And, and I'm still in touch with a lot of those students, and they've done incredibly
[01:27:17] well. And I also also taught jujitsu while I taught history. And I'd say any of you don't
[01:27:22] like your grade, you can come to the jujitsu class and you can settle it with me on the mat. How's
[01:27:27] that sound? Hey, when you look at the Cameroon in Cambodia, when you look at the Nazis, Nazis had
[01:27:39] like a ramp up period, you know, it took 1933, you could see it brewing, there was this sort of
[01:27:46] slower boil as the things started to transform. But the Cameroon was like, overnight madness.
[01:27:59] And madness at a level that's it's it's it's it's actual insanity. Well, it was class resentment
[01:28:07] that was stoked. And so you had an incredibly corrupt, you had the crazy King Sienaq, who was,
[01:28:15] you know, just this kind of wild playboy, and incredible decadent corruption of the elites,
[01:28:25] and the peasantry resenting them already, leading really hard lives. You know, when you go up in
[01:28:32] the Cambodian provinces, a day seems like a week, and it's hot, and it's just it's a hard, hard life.
[01:28:40] And and so, you know, they're seeing these very westernized, you know, decadent elites in the city,
[01:28:49] and then you have pulpotting, serice, cusampon, and these are all Sorbonne educated. So and they
[01:28:57] bring the latest trendy Marxist theories, and, and particularly Mao, and, and the cultural revolution
[01:29:05] becomes, you know, the model. And they want the blank slate clean peasants year zero. Yeah, they want
[01:29:15] people, you know, most of the elites were, you know, real, you know, peasants with, you know, no
[01:29:23] education, nothing. And they would get them away from their parents and reshape them. And, and,
[01:29:30] and that's what they did. And they did very quickly. And they did it with great Chinese support,
[01:29:36] and denial on the Western left, who were, who were, you know, no Chomsky in particular,
[01:29:43] that, you know, would deny the atrocities and cast a shadow of doubt over what was going on when it
[01:29:49] was pretty clear what was going on. And then it was a very shameful period. And then it was
[01:29:56] shameful afterwards when everybody knew and propped them up in the name of Cold War geopolitics. And so
[01:30:05] yeah, and then I mean, so you have in, you know, in 79, you have the Vietnamese knock out the
[01:30:11] Khmer Rouge, then the Chinese knock take a run at the Vietnamese and they have a nasty little,
[01:30:18] you know, border war for a minute there. And then they come to a truce. And basically the Chinese
[01:30:24] are like, you're not to talk about the genocide. Okay. And, and they gave the they did a lot better
[01:30:31] than people thought they would the Vietnamese Vietnamese are pretty fierce. And, and so,
[01:30:39] yeah. And so that that was that was how those, you know, those Cold War geopolitics, you know,
[01:30:44] shape things up. All right. So when did when did when did facing death in Cambodia actually come
[01:30:52] out 2005? Oh, so you were working on that for you're working on that book for 10 years, 10 years
[01:30:58] usually. You're not you're not a fast writer. No, no, I'm very fast. But I had to let the events
[01:31:05] play out Hickson's book took me six months. Okay. So so that means where were you you were in
[01:31:13] Cambodia when 911 happened? I was. And how what was that like? It was surreal. My buddy Luke Hunt
[01:31:22] who had just come from Afghanistan and I think he had interviewed Mullah Omar. And we were at the
[01:31:29] foreign correspondence club. It was late. And, and he could he's Aussie and he runs up the stairs
[01:31:35] World War three started World War three started. And I was like, I'll get out of here. And, and I
[01:31:41] was kind of in denial. And I said, Oh, you know, it's just I'm drunk and a Cessna. And so I had a
[01:31:48] room I would keep at the foreign correspondence club. So me and another reporter and Luke went down
[01:31:54] and we're drinking beer and watching the thing and all of a sudden the second plane flew in.
[01:31:59] And I went, What the fuck? And then then the only thing I was right about was when all of a sudden
[01:32:08] the whole screen went gray. And I was like, it pancaked. And I knew that from construction
[01:32:14] because I'd seen controlled I'd seen buildings collapse and things like that. Because, you know,
[01:32:20] I've been around construction my whole life. And so that that's when I got real. My wife was in
[01:32:27] New York City. And so it was impossible to get in touch with her. And we were on the Upper West
[01:32:34] Side. So we weren't quite near it. But yeah, that was then I took me a long time to get back. And I
[01:32:41] was stuck over there. And yeah, it was it was surreal. Okay. And so this book comes out 2005,
[01:32:53] Facing Death in Cambodia, that's received better than Lawnmower. Yeah. And then in the meantime,
[01:33:02] you're working on this on the Greeno advanced rescue craft. Yes. So George Greeno, who's like a
[01:33:09] legendary kind of iconic surf surfer, shaper, he's kind of credited for the modern surfing fin.
[01:33:19] Yeah. How did you how did you know him? When I lived in Australia. And then that's right,
[01:33:25] you live the next door neighbor. Yeah. And then I would come often from Cambodia to Australia.
[01:33:33] And so it was like the cute the PTSD cure was being afraid of getting eaten by I mean getting,
[01:33:43] you know, killed by the Cameroon. And then you go surf these outer reefs with George Greeno and
[01:33:48] have to worry about getting eaten by great light sharks. And there were so many sharks there at
[01:33:54] that. And they still are it's actually much worse now. And then and I had grown up on boats and George
[01:34:00] always had these incredible skiffs. And he had won a 12 foot boat. He's an amazing fisherman. He
[01:34:07] caught a 12 foot and a 13 foot tiger shark on hand lines off his 12 foot boat, cut both heads off
[01:34:16] with a serrated bread knife, brought them both in. And you know, before it was before sharks
[01:34:22] became the new dolphin, we regularly fished for sharks and didn't feel really bad about it. But
[01:34:28] but anyway, so I fished with George a fair bit. And and I was living on the North Shore. I had
[01:34:36] been a lifeguard and I was having to make a lot of rescues in Moklaia. And the North Shore guy who
[01:34:44] does all the sleds and rescue stuff taught me how to drive a jet ski. And I was like, these things
[01:34:51] suck. And then I had friends in the teams and they were telling me about all you got to do is make
[01:34:56] this one Yamaha SUV that we want because it's stable, just splash a mold off it. And of course,
[01:35:02] that would have been too easy. I don't do anything easy. I always have to reinvent the wheel. So I
[01:35:07] called George, hey, George, you still got the mold for the 12 footer. Yeah, I do. Okay, let's let's
[01:35:12] make a jet boat. And so in the dirt under George's house, me and my old right hand man from Cambodia,
[01:35:21] cut the jet ski up and married it to his 12 footer. And the first one came out of the mold.
[01:35:27] Perfect. And then we canceled, we canceled a military program. And that really, I didn't
[01:35:40] understand military contracting, things like that. And then then we were a big threat and military
[01:35:47] military industrial complex stuff. And, and it wasn't fun anymore. The military industrial
[01:35:53] conference will, will eat you alive. Yeah. And Ivan was a great ally. And we, the teams loved the
[01:35:59] boat. The PJs actually became our best, our best clients, because it was, you know, C 130 dropable.
[01:36:06] So did you actually start manufacturing them? Oh, yeah, yeah, we sold, I think about 30 to the PJs.
[01:36:11] But then they made us, they didn't let us cut up Yamaha jet skis anymore that were perfect
[01:36:16] with perfect wiring harnesses and gauges and all that. So we had to cob and a crappy engine that
[01:36:23] they made us use and wiring harnesses and steering and all that. And just it was like death by 1000
[01:36:28] cuts with NAVC engineers. And, and it was no longer fun at all. But, but I managed to get through it
[01:36:37] and came in on time and on budget and delivered the boats and then sold my company to a company
[01:36:43] called Maritime Applied Physics. And now it's probably the best unmanned craft out there.
[01:36:50] And it's got a Volvo Penta and it's super badass. It goes like 50 knots. Now was it, was the James
[01:36:57] Clark Lance McNair, Mike Deeds, Crystal Lance, those guys, those surfers, guys that were captured
[01:37:04] off of Cambodia and imprisoned and killed. Was that sort of the first thing that, that,
[01:37:11] that the thread that led you to writing tie stick? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And so I found out about
[01:37:17] that and I got more information. And I was at Scorpion Bay and which is kind of like a, you
[01:37:24] know, a smuggler's retirement home now. And, and, and it was unbelievable. Oh, yeah, I knew them.
[01:37:31] And, you know, all these people, I knew them, I knew them. And then they kept saying, you need to talk
[01:37:35] to Mike Ritter, you need to talk to Mike Ritter, you need to talk to Mike Ritter. And then they
[01:37:40] and, and I finally met Mike Ritter and he had been a big smuggler in Thailand. And what he didn't
[01:37:48] tell me was that he had been contracted to supply their load. And so he, so he had been
[01:37:55] contracted to bring them their load of pot from Thailand. Yeah, from Trot. So those guys were on
[01:38:03] a boat sailing to Thailand. Yeah, they were going to link up. Yeah. And Mike Ritter was going to give
[01:38:08] them a load of pot to bring wherever, try back in the States. Yeah. And Ritter was a surfer from Santa
[01:38:13] Barbara. And he would go on a Thai fishing boat with, you know, usually no compass. They'd give
[01:38:20] them the crappiest boat they had because they didn't want to get it seized. And he'd have one of those
[01:38:25] truffle log spinners and, you know, just old fashioned navigating. And he'd bring the pot out.
[01:38:31] And, you know, pirates and I mean, that's that period of time is the worst period of piracy in
[01:38:38] world history. This is what years? This is in the 70s. late 70s. Yeah. So, well mid to late 70s.
[01:38:43] Yeah. Vietnam falls in 75. So you have all those Vietnamese going out to sea with all their worldly
[01:38:51] possessions, usually in women's jewelry. That's how they carry their wealth. So you had the most
[01:38:57] feral brutal pirates you could ever imagine. So that was a very dangerous piece of water. And
[01:39:04] and so that's what Ritter was doing for for many, many years and living in Thailand. And
[01:39:09] he was one of the first guys to surf Grodjigan, one of the first guys to surf Bali. So you had a
[01:39:15] bunch of smugglers in Bali in the off season. And basically Grodjigan was founded by pot smugglers.
[01:39:22] And so they were the ones who really were the first to really kind of explore the Indonesian
[01:39:29] archipelago. And and that was, you know, Ritter was one of them. And so then I trained him as a
[01:39:35] historian. And then he started interviewing his sources of old retired smugglers. And we made
[01:39:44] sure we interviewed people who had been busted. So there was at that time no double jeopardy.
[01:39:49] And then things got a little wobbly after 9 11. And and and then I was going to find the old
[01:39:56] Khmer Rouge guys and, you know, different, you know, people on that side, law enforcement,
[01:40:01] confidential informants. There were a lot of old US intelligence guys involved because, you know,
[01:40:07] they had they had the knowledge of Thailand. And they had the insurgent areas of Thailand
[01:40:14] was where all the pot was grown. So they had worked those in surgeon areas during the Vietnam War.
[01:40:19] How long did it take you to write Thai stick? 10 years. But that was 1000 hours of interviews we
[01:40:25] did. Yeah. What do you think the value of the trade, the pot trade coming out of that the surfers
[01:40:34] brought into America? Well, I mean, at that time, it was great. But but ultimately, it's it's basic
[01:40:41] Adam Smith economics. It becomes too expensive to transport it. The the loads get too big. I mean,
[01:40:50] we're talking about like 20 30 ton loads. And then it drives the industry to the United States.
[01:40:59] California is growing the best spot in the world. So people are like, why don't we just grow it in
[01:41:03] Mendocino or, you know, Trinity or one of those counties. And so so there's no the money's gone.
[01:41:11] And so that's ultimately what happens in 88. That's where there's there's a bunch of huge busts.
[01:41:19] And the the biggest guys kind of go down. And then nobody wants to bother with it. It's
[01:41:24] not it. It's implodes. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Now at some point during this, you you you got another
[01:41:31] book that you're working on right now. Well, I guess before we get to that, you got you did
[01:41:40] right end up writing breathe. You wrote the Hixon book. Yeah. And you kind of kind of got into
[01:41:44] that a little bit. But what was the what was the spark? How'd you convince Hixon that he needed
[01:41:48] to write a book? We had been talking about it for a long, long time. And he and I talk a lot.
[01:41:57] And and like I said, and then it's never light. And and there's a lot of stuff I know that he
[01:42:03] doesn't know. And there's a lot of stuff that he knows that I don't know. And we always were friends.
[01:42:09] And I was a jujitsu skeptic. I was not for how many minutes. Well, I wasn't it wasn't that it didn't
[01:42:16] work in a one on one situation. But but in the worlds I was in, I loved it as an exercise thing.
[01:42:24] I loved it for the friends I made by going and beating these terrifying guys, and then being
[01:42:31] nice and not humiliating them and making them into students and made some of my best friends
[01:42:36] around. I mean, I fought guys in West Australia, Canada, Maine, Cambodia, always with the like,
[01:42:43] well, that wouldn't work on me. And you know how it goes from there and the skeptic for three minutes.
[01:42:49] Yeah. So I was like John the Baptist of jujitsu for a minute there because I was just had
[01:42:55] done it early. But I didn't like ease. And I didn't, you know, there were just pieces of it. I didn't
[01:43:02] like I like striking. I was confident striking. I had some very patented entries that were kind of
[01:43:10] like, you know, I don't have a politically correct way to say it. But the lunging special needs person
[01:43:19] and a drunken monkey. Exactly. Just like, good knows what what what and then close the distance.
[01:43:25] And so, you know, so I, you know, again, and I would throw this stuff at Hicks and come on, Hicks and
[01:43:32] like, yeah, yeah, try to try to disarm me with this knife, like, because I learned the fencing
[01:43:38] from the Russian guys and they're so fast. You're not they're not doing this. They're doing that.
[01:43:43] And so, you know, we really kind of explored this stuff for a long, long time and in a very
[01:43:50] honest way. And we're really good friends through a lot through his son's death. And, you know, I knew
[01:43:55] his son well. And so, yeah, he just finally, I think the COVID year, everybody, things were going
[01:44:03] slow. And that's how we got going. Well, I mean, that was a fantastic book you and you had the New
[01:44:10] York Times bestseller list. Yeah, yeah. Whether they liked it or not. No, Hicks and Hicks and did.
[01:44:16] Boy, we got the worst review I've ever had in my life in Publishers Weekly. And it was, you know,
[01:44:24] toxic masculinity gone wrong. And it was classic. I loved it. And oh, yeah, it was bad. I wrote a
[01:44:32] novel called Final Spin and Publishers Weekly gave me a great review. And it was pretty awesome. And
[01:44:40] my editor like sent it to me. He goes, I can't believe this. They compared me to David Mamette.
[01:44:47] Wow. And just like, oh, this is, you know, bought. And my publisher was like, dude, this is insane
[01:44:54] that they gave you this incredible review. And I was like, well, it's not that insane, bro. It's
[01:44:57] an awesome book. But, but yeah, the thing, the thing that was cool about it was I know that
[01:45:04] Publishers Weekly, they don't play around. Like if they're coming at you, they have no problem just
[01:45:09] trashing your book if they don't like it. So they didn't like breathe. Oh, I hated it. But it was great.
[01:45:14] And there was like, nobody should be interested in this book. There's only martial arts deviates or
[01:45:21] something to that effect. And, and then it was bestseller a week later. Tell us a little bit.
[01:45:29] And you mentioned this quickly. You got the Fainting Robin Foundation, which is a non-profit
[01:45:34] that you have the title, the name of the foundation comes from an Emily Dickinson poem, which is,
[01:45:41] if I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain. If I can ease one life, the aching
[01:45:45] or cool one pain or help one fainting Robin unto his nest again, I shall not live in vain.
[01:45:53] Meaning that if you can help someone that's really not in a position to help themselves,
[01:45:58] that's going to be a positive thing. Absolutely. What inspired that from you?
[01:46:02] I was watching my professions disappear. Journalism, number one. The internet really killed a lot of
[01:46:13] our careers. You know, we went from, you know, getting paid per word royalties every time
[01:46:20] something was published to flat rates and just it goes on the internet. It's gone forever.
[01:46:27] Well, I mean, I kind of look at like that's because I'm on the other side, right?
[01:46:31] I'm like the I'm from the people. Yeah. Yeah. You know, we have a podcast.
[01:46:36] I remember I went to we had, we'd had this podcast for maybe six months or something,
[01:46:40] and I went and got interviewed on NPR. And so I roll into this NPR interview is in New York City.
[01:46:50] I go into a full on studio. There's six or seven people behind the glass pane. There's two people
[01:46:56] in the room. Then there's the person that's interviewed. It's massive, like this massive
[01:47:00] production. I mean, as you can see, like this is the we're sitting in our recording studio right
[01:47:05] now, which is literally a converted closet. This used to be the maintenance closet at Victory MMA
[01:47:10] and Fitness. We eventually made it a little bit bigger than it used to be. But I go in there.
[01:47:15] And so then I go, you know, like how many people listen to you? How many? What's the audience of
[01:47:19] your show? Because I was talking to the guy a little bit afterwards, and he gave me some number.
[01:47:23] And it was some not big number. And I was like, dang, here's me and Echo Charles with a thousand
[01:47:31] dollars worth, literally a thousand dollars worth of equipment. How don't you spend when you first
[01:47:34] bought the gear? Yeah, a thousand dollars worth of equipment. And our audience was at least 20,
[01:47:40] literally 20 times as big as theirs. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm thinking this is kind of awesome. Oh, yeah.
[01:47:45] Here's these people, they went to school, and they got promotion, and they're paying, they're paying
[01:47:50] people to listen to advertisements going on, all this stuff, all this hype. And we're sitting in
[01:47:54] here in a closet with a thousand dollars worth of equipment. Our audience is at least 20 times
[01:48:00] bigger than theirs. So I support the downfall of journalism. Yeah. So tell me your take. What am
[01:48:07] I missing? Well, it is much journalism. It's academia. And because I was also a professor.
[01:48:13] And that are you going to make me attack the academic profession now? Oh, let's go.
[01:48:18] I'm happy to help. But know that, you know, I basically was making less money as a professor
[01:48:28] with three, two books, three books, Ivy League PhD than I made as construction labor without a
[01:48:36] high school diploma at 17 years old without adjusting anything for inflation. And so what
[01:48:43] we've seen in academia is that the money's gone to middle management. So every special interest
[01:48:49] group now has a commissar that they go to who advocates for them. And the student is a customer
[01:48:55] now. So that's completely explained to me the commissar in the middle here. How's that taking
[01:49:00] money out of this professor's well, because Professor salaries have dropped 10 years disappeared to
[01:49:08] make way for this managerial class. And so the managerial class, you know, will typically when
[01:49:17] I first started, I would be the assistant dean for a semester. It was always a professor. Now
[01:49:23] you have people who are neither scholars nor teachers. And this is this, you know, I have a
[01:49:30] PhD in education. Come on, you know, you can teach or you can't teach. I can't teach you how to teach.
[01:49:37] And it's as much an art as it is a science. And and it's depressing, frankly. And I don't want to
[01:49:45] be around it. It's not there's just there would. Yeah, that's a whole that's a whole big ball
[01:49:54] of wax. But I was going to college when I went to college when I was 28 years old, because I had
[01:49:59] been in the military in the military sent me to college, I was going to the University of San
[01:50:02] Diego. And I was in class, I had an English professor, super nice professor, super cool. I was
[01:50:06] an English major. And she said at the beginning one of these classes, so I'd been in the Navy,
[01:50:12] I'd listened to Navy when I was 18 years old. And so I'd been in the Navy for 10 years at that time.
[01:50:17] And the professor, you know, was kind of saying, Hey, listen, you know, here I am, I'm a tenured
[01:50:23] professor. I have a PhD in literature, blah, blah, blah, blah. I went to this school and that school.
[01:50:29] And she goes, And yet I can't afford a house in San Diego. And so I'm sitting in the front row,
[01:50:36] which I always did. I sat in the front row of every class just looking at the professors,
[01:50:40] just like no one else cared, I would line up my pens, like in case I had a pen go down,
[01:50:44] I'd be ready with a secondary. And so I'm sitting there in the front row, and I would,
[01:50:48] I would over, I guess I was being a little bit abrasive, a little bit abrasive. But the teachers
[01:50:54] usually love me because I was like the old, I would most fully engage soon, they probably
[01:50:58] never had in their lives. So I'm sitting in the front row, she gets done with her tirade,
[01:51:01] and I just raised my hand, you know, straight up in the air. And she's like, And this,
[01:51:04] when I went to college was the only place in my life that they called me John, because that's
[01:51:09] what was on the roster. Because my real name is John. So they call me John, I never corrected
[01:51:12] him because I didn't care. So she says, you know, Yes, John. And I said, How, how long did you go
[01:51:17] to school for? And she goes, Well, it was told, I think it was the total was 10 years, you know,
[01:51:22] to get her, blah, blah, blah, this, this, this. I said, And how much did that cost you? And she
[01:51:27] said, you know, whatever it was $380,000 or something like this. And I said, Well, hey,
[01:51:33] I said, I enlisted in the US Navy when I got done with high school. And I've been working that whole
[01:51:40] time. And I have not one house in San Diego, but two. She was so, she was so frustrated with that
[01:51:50] statement. But it's kind of true. Because, you know, she literally spent two, that was what my
[01:51:55] first two houses in San Diego cost, I guess they cost a little bit more than that. But
[01:51:59] that was around what the first two houses I bought in San Diego. So, you know, that academic thing.
[01:52:06] And I mean, the academic world just seems to be have gone, it's gone insane. Am I wrong?
[01:52:12] Absolutely right. And, and the thing is, and I've seen this for a long time and spoken out against
[01:52:18] it for a long time, I'm a First Amendment absolutist. I believe anything short of that is
[01:52:25] sophistry, that this group gets this level and you, you know, and then we come back to, to comfort
[01:52:33] and safety and psychic damage in this and that and oh, you're, you can't, you know, criticize this
[01:52:40] group because of the psychic damage, you're inflicting this and that once you go down that road,
[01:52:45] you're, you're in sophistry lane and I don't want to play that game. And so,
[01:52:52] yeah, it's just everyone, my friends who are still in academia, walk on eggshells and,
[01:53:00] you know, they have to watch out for the cultural commissars because, you know, then you have this
[01:53:06] kind of a star chamber courts where the student goes to one of the many deans and says,
[01:53:15] the, he looked at me in a way that made me uncomfortable and my response to me, you were
[01:53:19] born uncomfortable. I can't help you with that and your level of comfort and my level of comfort
[01:53:25] aren't the same. So then the professor is accused without a hearing, without knowing who his accuser
[01:53:33] is. So there's no due process. I mean, one of the cases my foundation looked into was an anatomy
[01:53:40] professor named Michael Shively. He taught for 30 years at Utah Valley University. The president
[01:53:48] of the university son, universities, what was it, nephew kind of instigated a crusade against him
[01:53:57] because he was, his classes were too hard. He didn't put things up on the right, you know,
[01:54:06] blackboard, you know, sort of computer thing and they couldn't really get him on anything. And again,
[01:54:14] he didn't know who he was accused by. He didn't know what he was accused of. And after about six
[01:54:20] months, he started losing his mind and he blew his brains out. And then the family sued the
[01:54:26] university. It came out that it was, you know, that the president of the university intervened
[01:54:32] on behalf of her nephew. It went all the way to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. Now their attorney
[01:54:39] is going for a writ of cert to try to get the Supreme Court to take it up. But these are
[01:54:46] increasingly common situations where you are accused of something and you don't get to defend
[01:54:51] yourself. You don't know who your accuser is. And this is a real violation of due process. And I
[01:54:58] mean, I had a situation where I had a female student come and say, oh, well, I was, I was,
[01:55:05] I couldn't do, I've been missing the classes or something because I was sexually assaulted. I
[01:55:10] said, okay, that's very serious. I said, let's, I know the US attorney and like, let's do it, you
[01:55:17] know, if you, you got to think this through, if you want to, you know, go really do this, you go
[01:55:23] to the US attorney, you don't go or would the DA in town, you don't go to some academic bureaucrat
[01:55:29] that will pollute the case. If you want to go after this guy, oh, well, I'm not sure. I'm not
[01:55:35] sure. I said, well, look, you think about it. Let's talk about it. Tomorrow I go to the head of my
[01:55:40] department. I say, Hey, this happened. I told her she needs to go to the authorities if she's serious
[01:55:46] about it. She said, no, no, no, she has to go to the Title IX group and the this, which is an in-house
[01:55:52] university judiciary. And I said, no, I don't, I don't agree. And I, I'm not going to do that. And
[01:56:00] I'm on one semester contract. So what do you got on me? And I liked my department head. And I didn't,
[01:56:06] you know, want to make trouble for. But then I met with a student the next day, I said, okay,
[01:56:11] come on, let's get into the brass tax of this, because if you do go down this road of litigation
[01:56:17] and all that, you're going to get your past pulled out, it's going to be serious. And I said, was
[01:56:23] there alcohol involved? Yeah. Okay. And so anyway, it turns out she drank too much, passed out on a
[01:56:31] couch at a friend's woke up and there was one of the roommates had come in and was standing over her.
[01:56:36] And, and, you know, that could have ended this guy's career. It could have been incredibly
[01:56:42] problematic. And he wouldn't have known what he was accused of by who, or what.
[01:56:46] Oh, that was the extent of what it happens, what it happened. And so, you know,
[01:56:54] again, these things need to be heard out, you can't just take, you know, every man is guilty,
[01:57:01] every woman is always right. Life is more complex than that. I mean, I saw professors that married
[01:57:08] students that are still married. So I don't have a kind of childlike view of life. I treated my
[01:57:15] students as adults. And I talked to them like adults and I talked to them about their futures.
[01:57:21] And, you know, I would say every student would have to come and meet me in my office and people
[01:57:25] would say, Oh, don't ever close your door with a female student. So why I'm, you know, I'm married,
[01:57:32] I'm not like your students like your kids. And, and I would say, what's your major?
[01:57:39] What are you, what's your major? What do you want to do? What do your parents want you to do? And
[01:57:46] how much student debt do you have? Almost every one of those kids would say, no one's ever asked
[01:57:51] me that in my career. Thank you so much. No one, they've tried to sell them into a new program. Oh,
[01:57:57] we got this new graduate certificate. And I was like, what a certificate? I said, is that a masters?
[01:58:04] No, it's a certificate. I said, that's a fucking scam. And, and so, and I said, are they paying for
[01:58:11] you to get this certificate? Oh, no, I got to pay. I said, well, is the professor that's telling you
[01:58:18] to do it in charge of this certificate program? Hey, how'd you know? I was like, man, you're getting
[01:58:24] hustled. And, and so it's a business now. And because the universities are competing with each
[01:58:30] other, you know, to get students, they're spending huge amounts of money on gyms and vegan food bars
[01:58:39] and you know, just really ancillary stuff. You know, when I look at it, if you can get,
[01:58:50] if you're going to learn something of value, if you're going to be actually educated, great,
[01:58:55] knowledge is power. And you can, if you can go to go to some event or some school or some university,
[01:59:02] and you're going to learn something, you're going to walk out of there and say, oh, I know how to do
[01:59:06] this thing now. More power to you. Great. But yeah, if you're in there and you're spending money on
[01:59:12] something that has no value other than the paper that it's printed on, then it's, it's kind of
[01:59:18] worthless. And I don't know that I think that a lot of times the way the what, what people are taught
[01:59:26] isn't really a usable skill. And especially the way it's taught isn't really a usable skill. I mean,
[01:59:31] this happens with leadership, you know, a lot of there's, there's universities that offer some kind
[01:59:36] of leadership training, but it's not actually leadership training. They don't learn any leadership
[01:59:41] from it. They learn some weird abstract theory about leadership, but they don't know how,
[01:59:47] they don't know how, they don't learn how to lead. It's like if you went to college to play,
[01:59:51] to play guitar, and they never gave you a guitar to play, you wouldn't know how to play when you
[01:59:56] got done. You'd be able to talk about it a little bit, but you wouldn't be able to do it. And I see
[01:59:59] a lot of programs that are set up like that, where they're teaching you a lot about the guitar,
[02:00:04] and you learn some theory about the guitar, and you know what a guitar looks like, but you
[02:00:07] don't know how to play that guitar. And so basically what you learned has almost no value. So, you
[02:00:13] know, for leadership, for me, you know, the reason I know this is because I teach leadership,
[02:00:17] and we teach leadership to people that have gone through big programs, and they don't,
[02:00:22] they'll tell us like, oh, I learned more in the three days I just spent with your company
[02:00:26] about leadership, infinitely more. So, not even close to what I learned in my two-year,
[02:00:31] you know, master's degree or in my MBA. They just don't, they're not doing it in the same way.
[02:00:36] So, and I think that that's kind of become the standard. Sure. The standard is, oh, well, we can
[02:00:40] teach you about the guitar, and we can teach you about the music theory, and they can teach you
[02:00:46] a bunch of different guitars. We're gonna have a bunch of different guitars come and talk to you.
[02:00:50] We're gonna have the best, we're gonna have Eric Clapton come and talk to you, and Tony Iomi,
[02:00:54] it's gonna be great. And that is cool. Sounds cool, right? But you still don't know how to play guitar.
[02:00:59] Right. So, we like to get them playing that guitar. Right, right. Get on that gift box.
[02:01:04] But you're playing a high stakes game in your view of leadership, that there's actually something
[02:01:12] on the table. Well, yeah. But I mean, I teach businesses. I mean, the vast majority of clients
[02:01:16] I have now are, look, we teach law enforcement, we teach military, absolutely. But we mostly
[02:01:23] teach businesses. Sure. Business leaders. Now, business leaders actually do have something real
[02:01:28] at stake. They got jobs, they got capital, they got safety. There's, for sure, this is all
[02:01:34] really important stuff. But it is derived from the highest of consequences. Sure.
[02:01:41] Without question. And so because of all these changes, good and bad, maybe mostly bad,
[02:01:51] some definitely good. Because like I said, it's good that Echo Charles and I could sit in this
[02:01:55] room with $1,000 worth of equipment and talk to way more people than NPR. Yeah. In a lot of cases.
[02:02:00] You made the fainting Robin Foundation. So the mission is to help out people that need it.
[02:02:09] Yeah. And it grew. Like it started out professors, journalists, and journalists pushing the envelope.
[02:02:18] Right. The real guys like Ed Villamy, who was British Newsman of the Year, testified in the
[02:02:26] Hague, found the Serb camps in Bosnia, the people that are outliers that are coming into the later
[02:02:34] parts of their career and have really put it all out there. Isn't it kind of cool now that you can
[02:02:39] do that with no, without being part of the mainstream media at all? I mean, there's plenty of people
[02:02:45] out there that are publishing. I mean, I know you have a sub-stack. Sure. Sub-stack. I love sub-stack.
[02:02:50] You know, that's a way that you can go and you can get published and you can publish your stuff and
[02:02:53] you can get out there and you don't have to worry about the mainstream media. And say whatever you
[02:02:56] want. You can say whatever you want. Yeah. But then it grew into helping those who can't help
[02:03:02] themselves like a lot of veteran outreach. Your generation of veterans did more heavy lifting
[02:03:10] than, you know, really any generation, I would say in American history with the multiple tours, with
[02:03:16] a lot was asked of you. And I am living in North Carolina. There's a lot of veterans and having a
[02:03:25] hard time finding their way after their time in the service, many of them. And simple things,
[02:03:31] helping them find jobs, helping them do things like that, more complex things, getting them off
[02:03:36] SSRI eyes and the, you know, meds and stuff like that. They're giving out those things like candy,
[02:03:42] you know, you see this track in this most recent stuff that they're saying that depression isn't
[02:03:47] from a chemical imbalance anymore. Yeah, it doesn't work. This is like a big lie. Yeah. Like a 30 year
[02:03:52] lie. Have you heard the Secular Charles? So they used to say, Oh, you're depressed. Okay, it's because
[02:03:56] you have a chemical imbalance in your head. Take these drugs and they'll make you feel better.
[02:04:00] And now they're saying, actually, no, it's not a chemical imbalance. It's just like how you're
[02:04:04] feeling and drugs aren't going to help you in that way that we were saying they were,
[02:04:08] which is really freaking disturbing. Very horrible. And particularly the side effects.
[02:04:15] That's very disturbing. Yeah, the side effects are crazy. And the side effects too, that even
[02:04:21] when you read the fine print about what it's going to do to you, there's finer print that says like,
[02:04:27] Oh, and by the way, if you come off this at this rate, or you mix this with that, it's going to
[02:04:32] make you have literal suicidal ideations. Like it's crazy. Yeah. Yeah, it is. And that I'm,
[02:04:39] and Hickson and I have been talking a lot about that and, and finding, you know, natural ways.
[02:04:45] And I've been, this is some of the things I've been doing, but also doing kind of more direct
[02:04:50] action stuff like a woman, a friend of a friend in Santa Barbara's sister was murdered in Cambodia.
[02:04:56] And we launched an investigation and it took us about eight years, but captured the guy.
[02:05:04] Another guy, the old pot smuggler who did a double life, got double life and a billion
[02:05:10] dollar fine was a big smuggler, but all pot. And, and he did, yeah, 27 years for a conspiracy was
[02:05:18] not part of what, and I, you know, I read these things all the time. A drug conspiracy. Oh,
[02:05:22] yeah. Yeah. And he got out, he got a presidential pardon last year and we were lobbying for that.
[02:05:29] So things kind of, I'm almost like the last resort when everything, every other avenue
[02:05:36] is failed. They wind up at my doorstep and I can't take all of them. I mean, I basically work for
[02:05:43] my kitchen table with no office and, but it's is remarkable what you can do through persistence.
[02:05:50] And, and I have persistence. You're a, you're a one book, a book, a decade, right? Yeah. You got
[02:05:58] definite persistence. So there's a, we got this thread of your, of your writing. And it's the
[02:06:05] thread that you pull through. So, you know, you had the Nuremberg trials. This thread kind of leads
[02:06:10] to war crimes. This war crimes thread leads to Cambodia. The Cambodia thread, you, you find the
[02:06:16] surfers that got rolled up and tortured and killed. That thread leads to tie sticks. There's another
[02:06:22] thread that is something that you're working on now. And that's the battle of Cotang, which happened
[02:06:31] at the end of the Vietnam War. And the Khmer Rouge seized a U.S. merchant ship, the Mayquas.
[02:06:39] And there's this whole thing unfolds. So the, so the Marines go, they recapture the ship,
[02:06:47] but they also assault the island. There's a little island where it looked like the, the crew of the,
[02:06:54] of the Mayquas had been taken. And so the Marines do an assault on this island. Well, the island is,
[02:07:01] it's run by the Khmer Rouge. There's Khmer Rouge elements on there. The, the, they didn't know it.
[02:07:09] The Marines didn't know it at the time, but the crew wasn't on that island at all. And they'd
[02:07:13] actually been released and returned, but they didn't know they're already in the air. They go
[02:07:18] and assault this, this island. And I'm actually going to, you gave me like a kind of sort of a
[02:07:24] draft, your proposal, you're working on it. But let me just read a little chunk of this. This is
[02:07:29] your latest project. It's going to be called left behind. And again, the thread is, how did you get
[02:07:37] onto the story? You met someone that was on contact. You met a Cambodian Khmer Rouge. Yeah,
[02:07:42] that was on Kotang Island and fought against the Marines. Yeah, absolutely. This is what opens up
[02:07:47] this story for you. And you also started hearing about you were, you were tracking on the Americans
[02:07:53] that were in S 21, the, the prison. Yeah. Yeah. And you were hearing that there might have been
[02:07:58] other Americans and where were these other Americans? And so you pulled the thread on this.
[02:08:02] Yeah. Let me go to this little section here. From his trench near the East beach, M Psalm,
[02:08:08] and this is the, this is the Cambodian soldier that you met. Yeah. So, or sorry, Khmer Rouge.
[02:08:14] Yeah, one of a number. M Psalm watched knife 23. That's a helicopter. The next chopper attempting
[02:08:22] to land fly straight toward him. This one had a big propeller on top and a small one for steering,
[02:08:27] said some he shoulder his rocket and waited until it was 50 meters away and in his crosshairs.
[02:08:33] I aim for the head and hit the tail, he recalled. The helicopter's tail broke off with an audible
[02:08:39] snap. And now the rudderless CH 53 shuttered, spun and crash landed on the beach. All 25 Americans
[02:08:47] on board were able to escape from the wreckage and find cover soldiers in stretchy robes jumped
[02:08:53] down, said some there was exchange of fire. Now due to clouds of thick dust and smoke from the
[02:08:59] gunfire, the Khmer Rouge commander could not even see the beach and took a moment to pray to Buddha
[02:09:05] for help. I had been fighting all my life. But the fighting on co tang was really terrifying.
[02:09:11] The initial assault on the island had been a debacle. In less than one hour, the US had lost
[02:09:18] three helicopters and 11 men. The young Marines who had been training in Okinawa less than 48
[02:09:24] hours earlier were now experiencing combat for the first time all alone at seven at only 720 a.m.
[02:09:31] The longest day of their lives was just beginning. Unbeknownst to the Americans and Cambodians now
[02:09:36] fighting on co tang minutes before knife 21 landed on the island, Khmer Rouge radioed announced
[02:09:43] that they had freed the my gues and her crew. Even worse, the prisoners were not and had never been
[02:09:51] on the island. Al Bailey was standing waist deep in a Khmer Rouge latrine almost out of ammunition
[02:09:59] fighting for his life. He was happy to see Jolly Green 43 the big Sikorsky HH 53 search and rescue
[02:10:07] helicopter approach the land. The young Marine was even happier when he saw his six foot to 250
[02:10:14] pound Sergeant Fofo Sergeant T and you say that to a lot to tell me to tell me Sergeant Sergeant
[02:10:23] T to tell me walk onto the beach with mortar rounds exploding around him like a comic book superhero
[02:10:31] Sergeant T stepped out of the helicopter and was like, let me get this shit under control.
[02:10:36] It was a walk in the park to him. He was ready to conduct business recalled Bailey.
[02:10:41] He was like a pissed off parent who had just found someone had abused his kids
[02:10:46] born and raised in American Samoa.
[02:10:51] Man, how do you say his first name? Fofo. Okay, just leaving it. You got you got the full name here.
[02:10:57] Fofo my to golly something like to like to like golly.
[02:11:00] To a telly better known as Fofo moved to Hawaii at 10 and joined the Marines at 18.
[02:11:08] He spent his first tour in 1967 as a scout sniper hunting vietcong in the jungle.
[02:11:13] During his second tour, he fought in Chu Lai case on in the battle of Hue and was awarded two
[02:11:19] presidential sites unit citations for extraordinary heroism and a bronze star.
[02:11:24] After to telly's request for a third tour was denied. He became a platoon Sergeant with
[02:11:30] Second Battalion ninth Marines and had been training Al Bailey squad when he received word
[02:11:34] that training was over and that he would be leading them into combat for the first time.
[02:11:39] Although the soft spoken Samoan treated his men well, he'd made quite an impression on his charges
[02:11:44] in Okinawa when he broke up a fight between a black and a white Marine by placing each of them
[02:11:49] in headlocks. He shouted Marines don't fight Marines. Fofo smashed their heads together
[02:11:56] and knocked them both unconscious. Nobody and I mean nobody ever challenged him said Bailey.
[02:12:03] This man had killed a rack of Vietnamese. You could see it in his demeanor the way he carried
[02:12:09] himself. When Sergeant T spotted his Marines clumped together on the West Beach, he ran toward
[02:12:14] them shouting what the fuck are you guys doing calm the hell down and listen. Fofo worked his
[02:12:19] way up and down their line giving orders and words of encouragement. Finally he turned to Bailey
[02:12:24] and said only fire when the helicopter comes in don't waste ammo watch the trail any of these
[02:12:29] bastards cross the trail blow their ass away. Then he grabbed his M16 and said I'm gonna take care
[02:12:35] of this machine gun problem no shooting until I get back and vanished into the jungle. Fofo walked
[02:12:41] carefully in under the canopy until he heard an incoming American helicopter then he stopped and
[02:12:48] listened. The Samoan saw some branches move then he spotted two bare-chested Cambodians with red
[02:12:53] checkered scarves around their heads adjusting a big gun. When they began firing at the helicopter
[02:12:59] he shouldered his weapon but could not get a clear shot because of the foliage so he walked all the
[02:13:03] way to the edge of the machine gun nest and opened fire. By the time Fofo had emptied his one magazine
[02:13:11] one magazine one Khmer Rouge soldier lay dead and another was wounded but still alive rather
[02:13:17] than reload the Marine picked up a nearby machete hacked the wounded man until he stopped moving
[02:13:22] then grabbed their AK-47s cigarettes canteens and sandals as he worked his way back toward the
[02:13:30] west beach he saw another occupied bunker opened fire and ran towards it by the time the Samoan
[02:13:36] reached it the bunker was empty but a fire was still burning a pot of rice cooking and there
[02:13:41] was a fresh blood trail leading into the jungle. So this is some serious scrapping that these guys
[02:13:54] are going through and just going through some of the events it took place by 0700 there's 109
[02:14:03] Marines on the island three of the helos there was eight helos used in the assault three of them
[02:14:09] were destroyed on the insert between 0900 and 10100 100 additional Marines had been landed on the
[02:14:18] island nine had been wounded and those guys had been evacuated which meant there was about 225
[02:14:26] Marines on the island they make they're fighting throughout the day they make multiple attempts
[02:14:31] to extract the Marines they drop at 1800 at night they drop a freaking blue 82 massive bomb it's
[02:14:39] they call it a daisy cutter I mean it's just a massive bomb it creates a mushroom cloud it's huge
[02:14:46] after dark they finally start to get extracted they're loading helos under fire they leave dead
[02:14:51] behind they also leave with a false head count meaning they think that they have everyone but
[02:14:59] they don't they finally get back on the ships you know and now they do a head count of a legit
[02:15:06] head count and they they figure out that they're missing Lance Corporal Joseph Hargrove PFC Gary
[02:15:13] Hall and Private Danny Marshall and then they received a radio transmission from those guys
[02:15:21] like one of the aircraft circling overhead receives a radio transmission saying hey swim to see and
[02:15:26] we'll we'll get you and they respond only one of us only one of the Marines could swim effectively
[02:15:32] enough to actually swim to see and and these guys get declared missing in action on July 21st
[02:15:41] 1976 those were changed to kill in action the way it turned out Joseph Hargrove was captured
[02:15:49] pretty quickly he had a leg wound and then a week later and you go through the details even in this
[02:15:55] I don't want to you know obviously you're going to put a whole book together on this that we'll
[02:15:58] have to we'll have to cover on the podcast and I hope we can get Fofo in here to get it done
[02:16:03] that's the plan um
[02:16:07] you know because I know this and you talk about it here but he was he received the Navy Cross
[02:16:14] is that correct the Navy no he didn't receive he got uh it was interesting because on
[02:16:21] one of it's the Marine it was a very lower metal and I had a general look at the whole paperwork
[02:16:29] and the secretary of the Navy had signed it and he said the only reason the secretary of the
[02:16:34] Navy would have ever even seen this was uh because he was either up for the Navy Cross or the
[02:16:40] congressional medal so one of the uh one of the lieutenants got the Navy Cross for doing nothing
[02:16:48] close to what Fofo Tatele had done um and and even one of the things I've been trying to do is get
[02:16:56] them the Vietnam service medal and Tulsi Gabbard and Mark Meadows had tried to do it in 2016 and
[02:17:05] the official government position was well you know the uh the Vietnam War ended when the
[02:17:11] Paris peace agreement was signed in 1973 so this isn't the Vietnam War I mean their names are on
[02:17:18] the wall so it's it's a very strange case and I think there's a institutional embarrassment
[02:17:26] as I demonstrate there there's also knowledge that those men were left behind and I think
[02:17:32] what's motivated me on this case is is how heavily that's weighed on those Marines and those
[02:17:40] who knew that and were ordered not to talk about it as well and so um I spoke at their reunion this
[02:17:49] last May and um you know this is something that you know many of these guys have been back to
[02:17:55] Cambodia they've met with M. Somme they've pleaded with him where are their bodies and you know and
[02:18:02] I they they've sent the POWMIA guys from Camp Smith there to do the the mitochondria DNA
[02:18:13] and it's you know I think that the Ford administration acted very badly I think that they
[02:18:20] already had it planted on the New York Times as America is back and that was that was you know the
[02:18:27] height of our impotence so this is May 15th 1975 this is two weeks after the fall of Saigon
[02:18:35] yeah that's one thing that makes it so and again that you've got some of the details even that that
[02:18:41] I read here just that you're used to this kind of incompetence in Vietnam now by you know the
[02:18:49] generals the politicians McNamara LBJ like you're just used to this disgusting lack of ability
[02:18:57] to make decisions and lead and not be influenced just by raw politics on a daily basis just disgusting
[02:19:05] yeah and then but what's interesting about this this is like one incident and since it's a little
[02:19:11] bit separated and you've got a different administration you go oh it's the same incompetence
[02:19:17] and you just see these decisions getting made and these cover-ups are happening it's just gross
[02:19:22] yeah it's gross and of course it's the freaking men on the ground the Marines that pay the pay the
[02:19:27] ultimate price for these horrible decisions I mean you got a section in there about the seal
[02:19:31] commander yeah amazing yeah who's like this is total bullshit he's calling it good for him
[02:19:37] um yeah Tom Coulter and he basically you know faced down the admiral and said okay I'm gonna
[02:19:44] leave room on the front of my zodiac for you and your officers and you can go on that island with me
[02:19:50] and they were not honest with him either and they said oh we want to drop leaflets and this is kind
[02:19:56] of you know they had the lithographer aboard one of the navy ships print 10 000 cards Cambodian
[02:20:06] French and English saying bring all the Americans to the helicopter wreckage including the dead ones
[02:20:14] so that does lead you to believe they knew that these guys were behind I left behind I have no doubt
[02:20:19] they knew and um and again it was already on the cover of the New York Times and the press
[02:20:27] attempt and you know the pictures of Kissinger and Rumsfeld and Ford and Tuxedo smoking cigars and
[02:20:33] you know it's it's the carelessness of the human material you know that's the part to me that's
[02:20:39] so galling and I you know as the war on terror you know kind of pushed forward I'd see it more and
[02:20:47] more just badly used people lives destroyed unnecessarily I mean war is war but you know
[02:20:56] there's a kind of carelessness that only people who risk nothing who are never going to be near it
[02:21:01] who have never felt the hard hand of it or seen the aftermath of it that they can they can entertain
[02:21:08] these fantasies and do it without remorse and do it over and over again yeah yeah I mean you found out
[02:21:15] um through your interviews Joseph Hargrove like I said was captured with a leg wound and executed
[02:21:20] pretty quickly yeah but it was a week later yeah that they captured Gary Hall and Danny Marshall
[02:21:26] so those guys were on the island you got massive American forces around there that could have done
[02:21:32] any number of things to try and get those guys out and they just got yeah and they want and so
[02:21:38] and so you had the marine officers want volunteered to go back the seals wanted to go back I think
[02:21:45] the PJs had gone back to Thailand but the Wayne Fisk unbelievable PJ was on the Sante raid and
[02:21:52] you know the Apollo missions I mean he um you know you had all the all the people ready to do the
[02:21:59] heavy lifting without any qualms about doing it and uh and they just steamed away and left them
[02:22:06] you know left them behind gone and you know and that's uh they were stealing rice from the Khmeruja
[02:22:13] and so basically they finally saw boot prints going into their kitchen because every day the Khmeruja
[02:22:19] guys hey why'd you eat the leftover rice I didn't eat the leftover rice no you did you know so they're
[02:22:24] fighting about this and then the get they go to M.S.M. and they the same accounts of the rice missing
[02:22:32] uh is happening over and over so then they say okay there's still two guys here so let's set up an
[02:22:37] ambush they capture them coming at night to get the rice and they're at this point so physically
[02:22:45] beaten down they don't even bother to tie them up and in fact according to the Khmeruja they made
[02:22:49] them rice and made them food and they just waited for their orders and then they sent them to the
[02:22:55] mainland then they were put in a prison then they were probably interrogated and executed.
[02:23:04] So where's what's the status of this book right now?
[02:23:08] Um uh you know probably 10 years you know no it's been more than 10 years um it's uh it's a hard cell
[02:23:17] and it's funny that's going oh you know we don't want another book about the vietnam war that's
[02:23:22] what my agent was saying and I said look this isn't this is about this is about you know leave no
[02:23:28] man behind this is as old as warfare this is uh a much bigger kind of theme so we'll see I'll
[02:23:35] peck away at it but yeah there's not much interest in the vietnam war not that much interest in this
[02:23:42] subject. What's causing what's causing the lack of interest in the vietnam war? I think there were
[02:23:47] too many books uh there was just a big spate of books and it's just publishing now you know
[02:23:54] publishing isn't doing that well and everybody's nervous the economy's going funny it's just
[02:24:00] well that's one of the reasons for that is because you can publish a book with no by yourself
[02:24:04] yeah you know echo Charles could publish a book in a week yeah you could literally publish a book
[02:24:09] in a week yeah and it could be available on amazon and it could have which is 85 of book sales
[02:24:15] or amazon sure right now anyway so so echo Charles could write a book about uh bicep curls yes sir
[02:24:23] and since that's your area of expertise and he could have it published immediately yeah and
[02:24:29] he could have access to 85 percent of the market yeah which is a pretty unbelievable thing sure
[02:24:35] and so yes the publishers are definitely scared about that but I need to go back I gotta go back
[02:24:41] to Cambodia and do some more interviews and um would you if you're gonna make you've made that
[02:24:47] much effort you've made this much effort now you're gonna make some more effort what if no if
[02:24:51] your publisher doesn't want to publish or what are you gonna do you're gonna publish it yourself
[02:24:53] sure eventually but you know I have like three jobs so it's you know it's uh I have to write a
[02:25:02] lot of stuff to pay the bills and then I uh what do you normally write to pay the bills
[02:25:07] uh a lot of ghost writing some screenwriting um yeah have you written any screenplays that
[02:25:14] we've seen no not yet nothing you know it's Hollywood where everything almost always happens
[02:25:21] I wrote I co-wrote the screenplay for the Hixon movie and uh is that coming that's battling with
[02:25:28] Netflix because now Netflix is all you know taken on water and they're all panicky and
[02:25:34] um I wrote a couple of pilots for the tie stick tv series I wrote a really Kelly Slater by the
[02:25:42] the rights to tie stick he did but then he fumbled him and uh yeah he had a deal with Sony and then
[02:25:49] it's just Hollywood and it's it's just it makes the dod seem positively efficient same thing
[02:25:56] is going on though too with like Hollywood because if you want to you could make a movie and you can
[02:26:02] post it on youtube and see what happens well and the thing is like the Hixon movie is remarkable
[02:26:07] because it starts with Maeda so it starts in 1890 in Japan and Maeda is an unbelievable guy I mean
[02:26:17] he's prize fighting all over Europe he comes to the United States like in the 20s he's prize fighting
[02:26:24] in the south he's he's going to west point yeah and and then he fights like one of the gangs in
[02:26:32] New York guys in Brooklyn and and then he goes to Cuba and then I think we think he's the guy who
[02:26:39] invented the Mexican wrestling mask because no one would fight him and then he winds up in Brazil
[02:26:45] with the meets the graces and then that's where the second part of the story goes and Jose Padilla
[02:26:51] did Narcos who's from Rio grew up you know around Hixon and the Gracie's is the director so it ain't
[02:26:59] rocket science yeah that's a no brainer yeah and you're kind of like so I would I think you're right
[02:27:05] I mean I that's what I told Jose Padilla the director I was like go get some private equity
[02:27:10] people I mean this isn't that tough a business case to make yeah come on and that's not it's not
[02:27:15] like a crazy special effects movie or anything either like it's not going to be a huge budget
[02:27:20] film it's big like you know you got some great fights you know you have like Helio fighting
[02:27:27] Camara no Camara but you also have the Black Panther is former student okay Pantera you
[02:27:34] know the three hour 48 minute fight and and just classic stories that Hixon talks about like as his
[02:27:41] childhood and and so all that's in there and it's just you know you could see it Rio in the 70s and you
[02:27:50] know you know surfing yeah drugs and beating you know beating up street fights yeah yeah and so uh
[02:27:56] what's not to like yeah so they'll I don't know I just like when I write something for Hollywood
[02:28:02] I write it and I forget about it and my mom luckily I grew up around this and I grew you know I grew
[02:28:09] up on the set of Robert Altman movies and Altman was all in Altman was put in his house on the line
[02:28:14] to pay for that movie and there was none of this committee decision like the greatest oxymoron
[02:28:21] I've ever seen is what they call in Hollywood a creative executive and and so you go to these
[02:28:28] meetings about meetings and and everybody has and then I get in trouble because I'm not nice enough
[02:28:36] for whatever and then I'm not really allowed to go to meetings anymore and but the best meeting we had
[02:28:42] was we went into Ted Sarandos owner of Netflix's office and my co-author Mike Ritter glass like
[02:28:50] a half a pound of weed in a 1970s single finned pintail and we had the tie stick cover on top of
[02:28:57] it and I pulled out a rubber mallet and a chisel ripped the deck off of it and put a half a pound
[02:29:04] of weed in an abalone shell and pushed it to Ted Sarandos and go there it is it's all yours Ted
[02:29:09] and he's like and I was like nope I'm not taking it back leave it in your commissary whatever and
[02:29:17] so I left it a bunch of weed at Netflix oh well hopefully some of those things get eventually
[02:29:25] made man sounds like good stuff yeah uh that kind of has us up to date yeah we made it we made it
[02:29:31] through your life to this point um what do we miss anything no I don't I mean yeah but no
[02:29:39] I think we got most of the saline points there high points yeah uh people can find you at fainting
[02:29:46] robin.org if they want to support that you've got your sub stack which is peter maguire.substack.com
[02:29:54] sour milk and it's peter maguire's sour milk what's the what's the title about why is it called
[02:30:00] sour milk because I'm sour milk I'm a 57 year old white guy uh you got your books law and order
[02:30:09] sorry law and war facing death in Cambodia tie stick and then the book that I covered on podcast
[02:30:15] 293 I think with Hicks and Gracie the book is called breathe I wrote the forward and you did a great
[02:30:21] job and that was the best interview anybody did on that whole book tour oh well I appreciate it it
[02:30:26] was an absolute honor to be able to write that forward um when you hit me up I was like you
[02:30:32] know can you said can you write a forward I was like let me think about that for yes I can well
[02:30:37] thank you uh yeah that's just a great book and and and now you're working on a follow-on book
[02:30:42] with Hicks and yeah and what's the what's the premise of the follow-on book with Hicks and
[02:30:46] it's called invisible jujitsu and it's visible jujitsu yeah and it's there's a lot about jujitsu
[02:30:53] and fighting but there's also a lot about life and a lot about people dealing with problems and
[02:31:00] you know similar to the things you talk about and how the answer can't be found in a pill or a shrink
[02:31:07] and that you know you you kind of have to you you know there's sections on strategy there's sections
[02:31:16] on things Hicks and talks about generally but then I make him you know delve into in much greater
[02:31:23] detail and so I think people will find it very useful for their daily lives trying to get people
[02:31:30] kind of back in their bodies and out of their heads and uh I think there's really something to that
[02:31:36] and we've been teaching a lot of really civilian unathletic people really really basic jujitsu
[02:31:44] and how someone's walking into you what do you do you know do you let them close the distance do you
[02:31:49] so kind of coming back to the old self-defense jujitsu and a very fundamental level and uh
[02:31:56] and I have all these kind of auto shape civilian students I've been testing it on
[02:32:00] and they come every week and they love it even though they go drink 20 beers afterwards and
[02:32:06] get even more out of shape but um but now they want to roll and they're rolling and I've got to be
[02:32:11] careful that they don't get hurt because they're not in the best shape but you really see the change
[02:32:16] on them as we've all seen with jujitsu it does change people yeah I think the one thing with
[02:32:21] Hickson is like jujitsu is so much a part of him that there's you you kind of have to tease it out
[02:32:30] of him it's like the water it's like the water that he lives in right and so you ask him how the
[02:32:34] water tastes like that fish story right how's the how's the water they're like what what's water
[02:32:39] yeah so you're you pulling out because my I I connected so many things in my life because
[02:32:46] of jujitsu it made all the all the pictures start to become assimilated into the same world
[02:32:55] and that was he absolutely huge for me and so I think that you know if you pull those strings on
[02:33:01] on Hickson where he can talk about he makes a decision in life without thinking about it
[02:33:08] because that's just who he is but if you start saying hey why'd you make that decision why would
[02:33:12] you do it that way and then you can he'll start to see and you'll start seeing we'll all start to see
[02:33:16] that's the jujitsu well like he talks about acceptance you know and he'll use these words
[02:33:21] and you'll think it's kind of a new age thing acceptance and this forgiveness and I'll say
[02:33:26] what do you mean acceptance he goes well when finaki broke my orbital bones in my eye socket
[02:33:32] I had to accept the fact that I couldn't see and I was gonna have to fight him blind and I was
[02:33:39] figuring out how I was gonna fight him blind and I can't and I had a plan but then I got a little
[02:33:44] bit of vision back and I took him down and you know broke his knee and then choked him unconscious
[02:33:49] and so so it's funny because like you said to kind of force him to really elaborate on some of this
[02:33:56] stuff the well is deep no doubt awesome man uh echo any questions oh so you have your black belt
[02:34:06] yes when did that happen uh after 30 years I got it I don't know two months ago or something oh you
[02:34:14] just got your black belt yeah I have my black belt in jeek and doe but yeah I was a purple belt I
[02:34:18] think for like 17 years well I only would take belts from hixon so and I didn't I'm not out here
[02:34:26] all the time so do you're a black belt snob listen this guy he's like I only take a black belt from
[02:34:31] here crazy that's it yeah yeah he does make sense though yeah he started with hixon and then you
[02:34:37] know like all your knowledge and stuff like that it's like from hixon and then what some other guy
[02:34:41] kind of slides in yeah he's like you know I train with hands out too but you know it just
[02:34:47] it was different you know hixon six and I don her I trained with a lot how much did you train with
[02:34:52] hendo not much because I was a daytime guy so I trained with don her and John was a white belt
[02:34:58] I met him when he was a white belt I was a professor at Columbia when he was a graduate student
[02:35:04] and so you guys knew each other oh yeah you guys were bros yeah oh yeah and he would kind of ramp
[02:35:10] me up for Cambodia you know so I just like take these horrible donner beatings for a month so that
[02:35:15] nothing was really that bad in Cambodia the Legionnaires and stuff that didn't know jiu-jitsu so
[02:35:21] I'm so were you there when he quit being whatever he was being at Columbia and he just yeah oh yeah
[02:35:27] yeah yeah and yeah and he I was getting threatened by the Serbs and I was putting on this conference
[02:35:35] and I had all these big Richard Goldstone the chief prosecutor in the Hague and this and that
[02:35:41] and so John Donner and Paredi my old kickboxing coach came as the undercover security and just
[02:35:48] shadowed these two Serbs the whole time it was pretty funny but um yeah John Donner actually
[02:35:54] came to my wedding and wore a three-piece suit he did not wear lycra did he have a did he have a
[02:35:59] butt pack on no Donner was uh he was he's a classic guy and uh we had a lot of fun and uh yeah he was
[02:36:09] I could I could really plumb the depths of my cynicism with Donner
[02:36:17] well he's been awesome to watch him and his team um man they're just dominating yeah jitsu it's
[02:36:22] freaking awesome well he's I mean he's uh really sharp guy and um and you know on some level I think
[02:36:31] he saw my academic he saw my academic career and was like no way man I'm just gonna teach you jitsu
[02:36:38] no I remember Henzo and Henzo and Donner came to one of my classes at Columbia and I was teaching
[02:36:45] about Japan and the samurai and this and that had a student go um I don't think it's appropriate for
[02:36:52] you to to get into these these cultural stereotypes about the Japanese warrior culture they had almost
[02:36:59] 20 years of Weimar-like democracy just burying my head in my hands and I think that was probably the
[02:37:07] day Donner decided he wasn't gonna become a professor yeah well he's a professor of jitsu
[02:37:13] oh he is he is it's kind of wild you know you you've heard the story that like you know Dean
[02:37:18] Lister is obviously and he he had that conversation with Dean and it's kind of like this mythical
[02:37:22] thing now right it's a little bit of a mythical thing that Dean said you know Dean was get catching
[02:37:28] guys and Dean tells it's super humble you know I was doing okay with my leg locks training with
[02:37:33] some of the students which means people were he was getting tapping people out yeah I can tell you
[02:37:38] that right now because he's tapped me out one million times and I and I've seen it we used to do
[02:37:42] you know dojo storms and all that stuff and even just tournaments he would just foot lock leg lock
[02:37:46] everybody um and win by other methods because his whole game of jiu-jitsu but it's kind of wild
[02:37:52] you know like Donner was asking him like you know or said something like you know you spend a lot
[02:37:58] of time on the you know going for people's legs and and Dean Lister said why would you ignore 50%
[02:38:05] of the human body and that's become this thing yeah yeah but it's if you think about the the
[02:38:12] sharpness of of Donner heard to hear that and go hmm that's a really good point oh yeah that's a
[02:38:20] really good point and Dean was you know Dean it wasn't like if you have the idea that Dean was
[02:38:26] had a couple foot locks in his game and that's what no Dean was way deep in it heel hooks foot
[02:38:33] locks he was way deep in that stuff I mean so far deep into it that people have only caught up
[02:38:41] I think it's been now it's about a year and a half when Dean I was I would ask Dean like hey have
[02:38:45] you seen anything you didn't know yet it was like a year and a half because yeah now they're starting
[02:38:48] to do things that I don't know but that was a long time where Dean was just way above everybody else
[02:38:54] but it is amazing that Donner heard that saw what he did and said oh yeah there's something going on
[02:39:00] here and of course now we have Pete the Greek who's yeah well he's a wrist locker and he says what
[02:39:05] why would you ignore 5% of the human body yeah yeah well I trained with Lebel also oh hell yeah
[02:39:11] and so I try met him a few times and he's scary and and so I have his book you know he's got a big
[02:39:18] book about wrestling finishing holds that one yeah I guess it is and she has more than one I got a big
[02:39:23] giant book by Judo G Lebel and it's all these crazy finishing holds it also got like weird like you
[02:39:29] have a cane and how you can joke some with a cane and all this other stuff well I grew up watching him
[02:39:37] lucha libre eke eke ka eke televison la hankeles and you know that was wrestling at the Olympic
[02:39:43] and Gene's brother was the announcer and then Gene was the hangman Gene was like three different
[02:39:49] masked guys and and then you know when you train with him he goes into character you know get you
[02:39:55] in some weird neck twist me like who's the most beautiful man in the world and yeah he's a scary guy
[02:40:03] he I mean Judo Gene Lebel he has to be one of the premier guys and and for whatever reason it like
[02:40:11] didn't make it out you know like the Gracie's did the most incredible job of marketing jujitsu by
[02:40:18] creating the UFC yeah and Gene Lebel had some some MMA fights oh yeah and he ref what was the big
[02:40:24] fight he ref Anoki and Holly yes right Anoki now he refereed that fight yeah but again it wasn't
[02:40:30] quite it didn't quite get over the hump and maybe UFC wouldn't have made it over the hump
[02:40:35] because you know the fratida brothers and it was banned everywhere and it got eventually got picked
[02:40:39] up but man Judo Gene Lebel he he was a legit submission grappler before that was even a thing
[02:40:47] well he was a au wrestling champ god what a beast he was all japan judo champ at some point
[02:40:55] first american yeah and his mom I think owned the olympic auditorium or ran it something like that
[02:41:03] so he grew up training with like ed strangler lewis yeah the legit catch wrestlers yeah yeah
[02:41:09] the catches catch can guys so he didn't know anything but like you know real nasty old-fashioned
[02:41:17] submission grappling and and yeah and then you I got to go to his cabin at high elevation and you
[02:41:24] show up there at like 10 at night and uh was it a big bear or something yeah and you trained to
[02:41:29] like three in the morning and it was me peretti and john lewis and uh and and we walk in and his wife
[02:41:37] says oh hi boys and that and I and john lewis is so nervous he goes uh it's nice nice to know you
[02:41:43] and then and there's a loft and we hear this booming voice from the loft how do you know it's
[02:41:49] nice to know or you just matter and so but he actually surfed uh with lord tally ho bleers
[02:41:59] who was the old announcer for pro surfing who was a wrestler in hawai so and tally ho bleers took
[02:42:05] him to macaha like on a big day and like lobel got his front teeth knocked out and gene was terrified
[02:42:12] of surfing and so like and I was surfing a lot of big waves then and I must have a picture or
[02:42:17] something so I wound up at his kitchen table like talking to him it's about surfing for hours and uh
[02:42:23] and he was very close to the machatos and uh I think you know john joc machado is one of the guys
[02:42:29] who's impressed me as much as anyone other than hixon yeah and I've been able to train with him
[02:42:34] the last few years um and that's been great and he's he's a really nice guy and that's a book I'd
[02:42:42] like to write what about john joc yeah because being born with judo gene the bell uh both but
[02:42:49] but I think gene's a little more plays it close to the vest um but john joc born with one hand
[02:42:54] and becoming you know one of the best of all time and turning a handicap into an advantage is uh
[02:43:01] it's a remarkable story and he and again he's uh a great teacher did you run into the Armenian crew
[02:43:08] oh yeah go-kart yeah yeah yeah this is like a whole timeline oh yeah dean and we were going up
[02:43:15] there and like those guys were we we did matches in these underground places there was one place
[02:43:21] called neutral grounds it was in some terrible part of uh uh la and like there was pit bulls
[02:43:28] everywhere and there was no like it's just just mayhem but it's hard to explain that to people that
[02:43:35] didn't live through that the pre-cambian times I thought dean killed an Armenian one time like this
[02:43:41] guy these guys would not tap no I mean they were it was a life or death scenario for them oh yeah
[02:43:48] and and they were I mean obviously tough as hell and and they you know they they also knew they were
[02:43:54] also walking in new oh yeah they they were all linked in with judo gene labelle so there's a mayhem
[02:43:59] going up there oh yeah awesome times yeah there were some there were some uh definite chaos between
[02:44:05] jujitsu and I guess sombo maybe yeah at jujitsu tournaments yeah and it would be mayhem but it
[02:44:15] was fun yeah a good way to start to learn things everybody got a lot better fast yeah no doubt about
[02:44:20] it yeah now it's like you you got to just have an open mind with everything yeah you know you got to
[02:44:25] keep that mind open um anyways man yeah a few more things oh we got more questions yeah rewind back
[02:44:33] to tahiti right you're talking about the guy who was who's that guy her husband the sugar daddy oh
[02:44:38] the sugar daddy from paris landed from paris brutal showed up on an ounce and started smelling the
[02:44:44] sheets damn so you were just out at that point passport where is it yeah where is it that's probably
[02:44:53] the most everything you've done that might have been the closest to death you've been and then back
[02:44:58] to your weed uh selling days you said you didn't like to do the small stuff no only do like bigger
[02:45:03] like what how does that work where would you get it from or whatever from the older guys who were
[02:45:07] smuggling it okay so you had to deal with like the the older yeah but they were guys I knew from
[02:45:13] surfing it was very small closed loop it wasn't and they would what sell it to you and yeah you'd
[02:45:18] sell it yeah yeah basically and it didn't want exposure didn't want you know people coming to
[02:45:23] my house or whatever it was just go to mcdonald's and bring in the duffel bag and they leave with
[02:45:30] the duffel bag or you know usually but the crencha stuff was you'd sit on the front porch and you
[02:45:36] know that was a trip like that was a whole another world what's going on there well that was um it
[02:45:44] was just out in the open you know and and I had a I had a white Mustang GT and when that white
[02:45:52] Mustang GT pulled up like line would form and people coming from all walks of life all ages
[02:45:59] everything and and I remember once these cars came screeching up and I was like oh man it's a drive
[02:46:07] by and and they get out and they just robbed the crencha high school marching band and so they have
[02:46:17] sounds like a great take so they got a trombone and so they're trying to run up on on the porch of
[02:46:24] the house where I am to stash the stuff and my buddy's mom comes out no no no they're not putting
[02:46:30] that here so I was like get that shit out of here so then there's like 10 guys walking down the street
[02:46:35] with like crencha cougars big drums and tubeless stuff like oh man yeah so I I uh the truth is
[02:46:46] always stranger than fiction you know it really is and it's just you know yeah how much money you
[02:46:52] when you went on your eight or nine month trip to Australia and and southeast asian what not
[02:46:58] how much money do you think you had in your how much money did you have in your bank account when
[02:47:01] you rolled out probably like 20 grand or something that's like more than enough yeah live forever on
[02:47:07] yeah and my rent in Australia was there's like 300 Australian a month right across the street from
[02:47:15] a little grass trail to broken head point and you know go to the pub and you know play pool in the
[02:47:23] afternoons and yeah it was great and yeah and then the the banquet for the surf contest I was in a
[02:47:30] few surf contests always had to culminate with a giant wild wild west fight and and the Bondi guys
[02:47:38] were real bad asses so aunt and the Bondi guys would come up and it was the big one was the
[02:47:43] sky Easter classic and so we were all in that and then then some guys from Malibu came and they
[02:47:50] started slam dancing at the at the awards banquet and the Aussies thought they were fighting and it
[02:47:57] turns into the gnarliest wild wild west brawl you've ever seen and um yeah and and uh one of the
[02:48:05] Americans got his lips split a little bit and you know it just comes with the turf and uh
[02:48:11] uh yeah no I love the Aussies uh yeah I still thought I'm still friends with all those guys yeah
[02:48:16] I was lucky enough to go down there for a bit and um it was one of the places where I was like man I
[02:48:21] went to damn Nusa oh yeah what the that place is ridiculous oh yeah no no but see then I started
[02:48:30] going to west Australia and that's gnarly and so by then I was pretty good in jujitsu and they
[02:48:37] called me the human knot and um and my friends it's like four brothers and they're the best guys at
[02:48:44] Margaret River so I would stay with them but I would first have to line them all up on the lawn
[02:48:49] and beat all of them just to get it over with and I would also have a mouthpiece with me
[02:48:53] anytime I went out and so and they worked these are hard guys they worked all day on the black top
[02:49:00] shoveling black top and uh and the father was a treasure hunter deep-sea diver and they were also
[02:49:07] commercial fishermen and they come home and their little counsel worker outfits with the
[02:49:12] short shorts and the one brother who was the wimpiest one but he was the natural in jujitsu
[02:49:19] so suddenly he's whipping the brothers they've been kicking his ass this whole life and he's like
[02:49:24] oh and he's really looks scared I go what's wrong Jay he goes well cousin Dave's a bit crook with you
[02:49:32] and I'm like okay cousin Dave I don't know your cousin Dave I go what are you talking about he goes
[02:49:37] well I've gone and shown him that choke and he said no seppo choke's gonna work on me so I've
[02:49:42] gone and shown him but but I forgot to tell him to tap my leg and he's gone unconscious on the job
[02:49:47] site and so then I'd go to these parties and like cousin Dave want to give me the king hit which is
[02:49:53] the sucker punch so you're having like always keep your back to the wall and watch out for cousin Dave
[02:49:59] so and then there was gentleman's night at the margarit vs board riders club which was
[02:50:06] you know an endless glass of beer for three hours then the fully naked strippers and then
[02:50:14] the motorcycle club crashed that party to fight with the surfers then then I and this was like a
[02:50:22] normal Wednesday night no this is a big event you know yeah and so no so we're there and you know
[02:50:27] stumble drunk in true Australian fashion and the whole front window shatters and they get the
[02:50:33] bikies are here the bikies are here so they spill out and there's some fighting with the
[02:50:37] motorcycle guys and then I'm thinking like I can't really stay vertical but if I jog slow it's a lot
[02:50:45] better so I'm kind of jogging slow and and and then and then I see a cop and I'm like oh man I got
[02:50:52] it that cops can get me for public drunkenness or something and then I kind of get lost and now
[02:50:57] I'm in west Australia it's like two in the morning and then I sort of get my bearings again I'm like
[02:51:02] okay and I can see where I'm staying and I'm going down the main drag of margarit river
[02:51:07] and there was like a crazy Australian Vietnam vet who lived in the park and all he did was march with
[02:51:15] this big staff on his head and do push-ups and body weight exercises and he was a monster
[02:51:20] and and I'm lurking in the shadows and I hear this oh I see you oh see you scaredy cat come on scaredy
[02:51:29] cat come out and fly and uh and I go down one block and there's like three blocks to my place where
[02:51:36] I'm staying I put my mouthpiece in and I just start running and I'm like okay it's football time and he
[02:51:41] didn't do anything but then I wake up the next day I'm so hungover and my wife says oh let's go out
[02:51:48] breakfast it's okay yeah and I caught you're married at this point yeah so my wife's gnarly and uh
[02:51:56] and so I take like two steps and run back throw up and I say I just got to go to the beach and get
[02:52:01] in the water and I'll be better like just let me get in the water so you go to margarit river you
[02:52:05] got to go down this long staircase and then there's a big beach with some rocks and I'm with walking
[02:52:11] with my wife and I get halfway down the beach I'm like and my wife just peels off like she's never
[02:52:17] seen me in my life there's like one twig I'm trying to hide under and puke and all the Aussies are up
[02:52:23] on the the thing watching the whole thing and that's when they're like ah that pike's a top block
[02:52:29] and that's like Australia you have to do that you know what year did you get married uh 2000
[02:52:35] wait a second so this was I wasn't married yet you wasn't married yet but it was you she became
[02:52:43] your wife yeah that was her that was that was her final she's like yeah that was your courting
[02:52:49] process yeah and a little time at Up Wedge Island at the lobster camp she liked that a lot
[02:52:55] where's she from originally south uh she's from virginia in florida but a real southerner where
[02:53:03] when did you meet her uh blind eight new york city in 95 I think so again how was she what was she
[02:53:12] doing down this shit was happening in Australia like I took her down there in 1995 no no this would
[02:53:18] this would have been about probably 97 or eight or somewhere around then oh so you were actually a
[02:53:25] grown man doing this yeah yeah I thought this was when you were 18 no no but but in Australia you
[02:53:32] say oh well that was back then everybody's old now and these guys all have kids and all that and
[02:53:38] then they're still down the pub oh no and then the two brothers that night went home and got in a
[02:53:42] fistfight with each other on the way home and then they had to drive like four hours to Perth in
[02:53:47] the car one with a black eye them not talking and the kids in the back and yeah it's the Aussie way
[02:53:54] that's how we roll I guess awesome man oh thank you appreciate you coming on uh thanks for thanks
[02:54:02] for joining us thanks for sharing your experiences um I'd say thanks for reminding us that life's
[02:54:09] a story and and in order to write it you gotta go live it yep so good lesson for all of us
[02:54:15] go out there and live thanks for joining us man thank you and with that Peter Maguire has left
[02:54:22] the building Echo Charles surfing jujitsu academia genocide a lot going on in there yeah definitely
[02:54:34] an interesting path and and it's a good thing to remember that when you're on a path you can step
[02:54:41] off that path and go in a different direction yeah you know this isn't I'm not talking about the
[02:54:47] I'm not talking about the path right capital T capital P yeah yeah we don't want to let's say
[02:54:51] you could be going down one lane of the road and you could get off and go down a different lane
[02:54:58] and it was kind of hard to convey this but a lot of this stuff was happening in Peter's life was
[02:55:03] happening at the same time he's doing jujitsu he's going to Cambodia he's writing about this
[02:55:07] he's still a prophet like he did a lot a lot of this stuff was he was living it was happening
[02:55:12] parallel in his life so that is definitely something to remember it sometimes I think people feel stuck
[02:55:21] in a rut and the reason they feel stuck in a rut is because they're staying in the rut that they're
[02:55:27] in and you don't have to sacrifice everything to go and you know put another toe in the water over
[02:55:32] here test the waters over there you know you can you can go and try to do two class you can go and
[02:55:38] take a guitar class you can go and do some research about something that you don't know much about
[02:55:44] you can go and interview people that's what does it cost to interview somebody doesn't cost anything
[02:55:47] go learn yeah a lot of opportunity out there man I was so surfing is one of those things
[02:55:54] jujitsu is like this too but surfing is a big one and you see you know you see movies about this
[02:55:58] or whatever right the even idea of the endless summer right where you're chasing like essentially
[02:56:03] you're chasing waves right you can go ahead and say it what point break point break okay so that's
[02:56:09] what I that's what I uh basically compared in my mind right because point break is essentially
[02:56:14] parts of it anyway right essentially instead of smuggling drugs but exactly right you know but
[02:56:19] it's the same gig you know where it's like I'm just gonna make as much money as I can as fast as I
[02:56:24] can so I don't have to work right right even though he was working all the jobs but still the idea is
[02:56:29] there where they'll rob all the banks and do all this and then just surf and skydive and stuff the
[02:56:34] rest of time and that's kind of the dream right or you just join the teams yeah but here's here's the
[02:56:39] here's the point with that and actually you're right though you're right where if you go around the
[02:56:44] world chasing waves where you you'll just by incident find yourself in different interesting
[02:56:50] situations where you'll learn new things meet new people have all these like varying levels of
[02:56:57] craziness experiences and then that builds on itself right you know you know how you like one
[02:57:03] experience with this experience put together it's like oh that's also and jujitsu is like that as
[02:57:07] well where but most people don't travel around just doing jujitsu sometimes you do sometimes you
[02:57:11] do and actually I had that experience on a small degree when I was traveling around doing filming
[02:57:16] jujitsu yeah but I was I would train too so that's how I met at that time all the main guys and they'd
[02:57:21] be like yeah come train because I'd be purple belt and brown belt so it's like the perfect guy for
[02:57:26] them to train with because I'm usually their size or whatever not good enough you know so it's easy
[02:57:33] to it's kind of they can beat me up at the same time and then give me the experience of their gym
[02:57:37] and all this stuff it's like hospitality thing it was perfect yeah and so I got that turn freaking
[02:57:41] everybody that is a good thing and then you get all these experiences and now you know them oh you
[02:57:47] know how he knew all these people you're like Eric Paul's in you know like all these people and he
[02:57:51] knew them all but it's because of that same concept where he's like he's going around chasing waves
[02:57:55] you know oh Hickson's here okay I'll take a jujitsu class or whatever and I'm gonna meet this guy
[02:58:01] now I know this guy you know it's kind of crazy how many like that for one level of connection to
[02:58:06] John Donahur and then John Donahur to Dean Lister and we got Judo Jeevan Lebel you got Eric Paul
[02:58:12] like all these are these guys are the premier people that brought the sport to what it is you
[02:58:18] know I mean I mean obviously you've got Hickson and Horian and Alio like for sure but then you have
[02:58:25] all like the second gen people that were coming up and it's just it's just interesting how it's all
[02:58:32] connected and it seems I guess it seems more interesting to me because jujitsu is such a
[02:58:38] big part of my world you know takes up a big part of my world takes up a big part of your world
[02:58:43] and but still like the connection between like John Donahur, Henzel Gracie, Hickson Gracie,
[02:58:55] Peter Maguire, Gene Lebel like it's just wildness it's wildness so I say you know I heard this some
[02:59:05] expression about like if you want to be a writer well what's the best thing you do if you want to
[02:59:09] be a writer go live oh yeah that's a great advice you want to be a writer go live somebody asked me
[02:59:15] yesterday when was I oh yeah when we were up yesterday I got asked um you know oh did you
[02:59:21] always want to be a writer I'm like nope now I've written I think 11 books but I didn't quote
[02:59:28] like I was like oh I'm gonna be a writer yeah I just was gonna be a commando and then happened
[02:59:34] to happen to start writing but that's a good it's not a bad and I'm not saying you have to be a commando
[02:59:39] but maybe you're gonna be of a damn jujitsu player or maybe you're gonna be a surfer or maybe you're
[02:59:45] gonna be anything go out and be something you have something to write about at least yeah take a
[02:59:51] little bit of risk too what was that quote he said about being careful careful careful get you killed
[02:59:56] careful get you killed yeah yeah careful kills careful kills but also careful prevents life prevents
[03:00:04] living and look I'm not saying obviously go out and do dumb shit but don't but don't let caution
[03:00:13] guide your every move where you don't take risk you gotta take risks because you're gonna be out
[03:00:16] there getting after it no look does it is it smart to smuggle pot no it's not but is it smart to
[03:00:24] hey I don't have too much money but I got enough money to get down the you know down to Indonesia
[03:00:28] I'm gonna go surfing oh cool you know don't do dummy legal shit but man roll the dice a little
[03:00:34] bit go get after it a little bit yeah it's gonna be good for you yeah it's almost like within a
[03:00:39] certain certain threshold it's like you that's the best thing you can actually do for yourself
[03:00:46] within reasons so sure if you would look at and be like hey this is dumb this is a dumb move you
[03:00:51] know illegal stuff mainly like falls within that category whatever um then okay that's exclude
[03:00:57] that everything else should kind of be in play anyway when you think about it seriously yeah
[03:01:03] and between the and of course on on one superficial and you got a cool story that's on the super
[03:01:08] but like all the stuff you learn whether you're successful or not it's like by the stuff you
[03:01:12] learn you'd be surprised how valuable that ends up becoming yep go get some experience go live a
[03:01:17] little bit that's the recommendation but the other thing it's a rumour is it's not too you know you
[03:01:22] can be I'm 50 I still need to go out there and get after a little bit more I need to take a little
[03:01:26] bit more chances in the world I will say and maybe maybe you disagree but I would say it gets harder
[03:01:33] and harder though as you get a you know take on more uh fixed responsibility that is true that's
[03:01:39] a hundred percent true from a financial thing but I'm not even and also in other ways it comes easier
[03:01:44] because now you got money like remember when you had no money yeah and you you know you were working
[03:01:49] as a whatever I almost feel like and maybe I guess it depends on the circumstance but I almost feel
[03:01:55] like when you have no money it kind of pushes you to have to do more stuff you know so if you have
[03:02:00] money I'll just pay for it just whatever whatever whatever kind of a thing where it's like things
[03:02:04] will come a lot easier and I thought about this too where you know how like when you think back to
[03:02:09] the times when you don't make any money it's like what what was the difference because 20 years I was
[03:02:13] in the Navy but think about it there are certain parts of life it's funny I say that but you know
[03:02:19] what I at the time and you've heard me say this like I was a richest guy in the world
[03:02:23] me and my friends in the games we thought we were the richest guys in the world we had so much money
[03:02:27] young single team guy dude e5 frog man gets on in your position too you get a lot of stuff paid for
[03:02:33] right by the you know like well wet suits right yeah a lot of the front shoots bro yeah and that's a
[03:02:40] huge deal guns ammo yeah what people would want to spend money on yeah you get a batteries toilet paper
[03:02:46] oh yeah right so that's literally my buddy had to free went to his house you know like the
[03:02:52] big industrial toilet paper rolls that are like a foot across that's what they had in the seal
[03:02:57] teams and this dude had it at his house outside pro you're a savage wasn't even a papers on toilet
[03:03:04] paper taking a freaking roll of that roll probably lasts like six months here's the thing well here's
[03:03:10] the thing and actually which is part of the fraud wastes and abuse by the way fraud wastes and
[03:03:15] abuse is though those things in life cost money and if you don't have a lot of money like certain
[03:03:21] parts little little tiny parts of life that all are and there's a lot of them too a lot of them
[03:03:26] every day all day those little parts of life are hard it's like they're so hard that you're taking
[03:03:32] toilet paper from the yeah you know guys batteries batteries there's kind of an unlimited supply of
[03:03:37] batteries in the seal teams oh yeah uh oh yeah any kind of rigors tape like what what do you call a
[03:03:44] gaff tape sure yeah that stuff you go to guys you go to a team guys house there's a freaking
[03:03:49] pretty good there's a box of rigors tape just in case some 550 cord some one inch two be the
[03:03:55] nylon yep so think about this let's say let's say you don't get free rigors tape and toilet paper
[03:04:02] and you have hotels oh yeah places to stay like these are pretty like per diem if you have if you
[03:04:08] have money or you get that stuff free it's kind of like it makes it things so much easier but it
[03:04:12] keeps you in a little bit more of a box than if you didn't so let's say this i'm a jujitsu bomb
[03:04:17] surf bomb whatever i don't have like i don't tell weed i don't rob banks i have normal uh i have to
[03:04:23] get a normal job i don't have that much money but i want to go to australia first off i'm not flying
[03:04:28] first class in this cozy thing and no one bothering me i'm i might even write in the cargo part and
[03:04:34] then have a good story or whatever but in you being coach or whatever you're gonna meet some weird
[03:04:38] dude or maybe you know or maybe some weird girl or something like this right then you go to australia
[03:04:43] and now you got to search for a place to stay it's not taking care of many adventures you know
[03:04:48] exactly right many adventures because you gotta you gotta like make do you got to struggle for
[03:04:52] everything and and it becomes more of a thing if you have money you're just like yeah you probably
[03:04:57] don't even book it you're like hey can you just book me in that hotel just choose the nicest one
[03:05:01] or kind of a thing so you don't have a story behind that you're safe in the hotel you're safe in your
[03:05:05] box you see i'm saying if you'd have money you're out there earning every little teeny tiny thing so
[03:05:09] you have way more of a experience seem saying embrace it risky too yeah all right well hey take
[03:05:18] some chances go out there if you want to support the podcast you want to support yourself you want
[03:05:23] to get stronger faster better smarter get yourself some jockel fuel new flavors in discipline go
[03:05:29] discipline go new flavors get yourself some moke i need some moke right now bro yeah and
[03:05:35] brah how's this and i'm with you right and you know how like you know kind when you get you know
[03:05:39] when you get hungry and then like even like a normal chocolate bar or something seems like oh
[03:05:44] like wait you know just when you get real hungry bro i i mixed banana moke and chocolate moke
[03:05:51] and i put some chocolate milk in it just because i like you know how everything sounds good to you
[03:05:54] is what i'm saying so i was like oh yeah i put some banana in there whatever and probably it was
[03:05:59] really really good i don't know if it's because i was so hungry or because that could be a banana
[03:06:03] chocolate is good it's a thing wait it was a chocolate peanut butter so that made sense think
[03:06:07] about it you chop up a banana put some peanut butter on it i mean in real life not moke
[03:06:12] and then put a little bit of chocolate on there come on bro that's good it's the same flavor is
[03:06:16] what i'm saying yeah so yeah moke get yourself some moke that way you do it's just so good especially
[03:06:22] like like i'm saying right now so it's pretty standard that when that we are here when we're
[03:06:29] recording i haven't eaten yeah so have you eaten today no so we're both on a fast right now yeah
[03:06:35] it all sounds good i'm gonna break the fast with like some mixed nuts and some moke when i get
[03:06:41] done with this little scenario so i recommend you do the same thing get yourself some moke get
[03:06:45] yourself some disciplined go and uh you can all that at jockelfield.com you can also get it at

[03:07:41] get yourself a gi go to originusa.com get american made gi don't get someone don't get a gi that's
[03:07:46] made by someone that's basically in a prison camp bro have you ever had a bad call have you ever been
[03:07:53] at home or wherever wherever you go and just thought to yourself i wish i was like doing
[03:08:00] jiu-jitsu right now yes and not the kind where it's like oh i wish i was doing something else
[03:08:04] jiu-jitsu sounds fun so that i'm you're like the feeling of man i wish i was actually like
[03:08:09] doing jiu-jitsu with someone right now you know what i had the feeling similar feeling but like
[03:08:15] so dean's had an injured hand because he broke his hand for like a couple months right and you know
[03:08:20] so when whenever we're training there's a little bit of a little bit of hold back right a little
[03:08:25] bit of oh hey you know hey switch arms hey switch positions hey oh hold on you know that kind of
[03:08:31] hurt that kind of thing and like the other day we actually like he i had forgotten he'd hurt in his
[03:08:36] hand because he's been hit he's at all taped up you know so when you're rolling you just see this
[03:08:40] taped up thing and then i was gone for a little few days i come back he didn't put the tape on
[03:08:45] because it's healing and it's weird just rolling and when we got done he said something like you
[03:08:52] know my hand felt pretty good today i was like oh i didn't even remember it but the roll was so fun
[03:08:57] because it was like the limits were off yeah i knew it was just like felt so good yeah so yes
[03:09:02] sometimes you got to train that jiu-jitsu yes yeah fully you ever and this is not a judgmental thing
[03:09:08] by any means but you ever um you ever think about yourself before you knew jiu-jitsu and
[03:09:14] been like man i felt like that was almost like an empty shell version of myself you ever think that
[03:09:20] you feel like you were not enlightened yes you feel like there was just a whole thing it was all a
[03:09:26] lot a lot of it too was like a lie but what's there's another word what is the word like the buddhist
[03:09:30] used to say is an illusion you were in i was a little bit of an illusion because there's a lot
[03:09:36] of things that you think that are wrong yeah just he just a straight up even even just the
[03:09:42] pragmatic things like i think i can beat this person up and you don't know jiu-jitsu you think
[03:09:48] that but it's an illusion yeah because you may or may i sure you might be able to but you also
[03:09:51] might not be able to yeah so there's a whole illusion to your life when you're not doing jiu-jitsu
[03:09:57] and that's a problem yes and this is you're actually suit absolutely correct and you're
[03:10:03] you know more about what i was just said than i do actually because now that you say that i remember
[03:10:08] yes that's correct because i was a bouncer in hawaii before i started jiu-jitsu oh yeah you thought
[03:10:12] you were the bad and i i never really thought i was bad because i worked with a bunch of big
[03:10:15] someone guys so i did not think i was a badass but yeah probably yeah probably related to him
[03:10:22] but i didn't think i was a badass in that group but compared to the patrons that would act up and
[03:10:26] stuff i did but i think of myself back then i was like almost like there was this big part of my
[03:10:32] brain that was just empty not knowing unknowing you know so yes not enlightened exactly right did
[03:10:37] you see they're making apparently they're making a remake of roadhouse yes yes you're fired up for
[03:10:43] that the pisses me off it doesn't piss me off but i just i know it's gonna be lame well it's connor
[03:10:48] McGregor so what what what who's connor McGregor he's he's in it he's slayed it given what i've been
[03:10:55] sent and you know it's funny you're the third person now to to bring actually oh yeah because
[03:10:59] everybody knows you're in they've been sending me the stuff yeah and so connor McGregor's gonna be in
[03:11:03] it playing what role well the online stuff that people sent me um had a picture of connor McGregor
[03:11:09] to be in roadhouse okay that's different he's gonna be in it he's gonna have a bit role that's cool
[03:11:15] no i think he's the guy but i don't know i didn't i didn't use dalton that's what i think no i don't
[03:11:21] know i didn't look at that bro a bunch of people just been sending it to me and then people have
[03:11:26] been bringing it up to there's a lot of roles that connor McGregor would be awesome at dalton's not
[03:11:30] one of them in my opinion i don't know you think so i don't i have no idea i think he'd be better
[03:11:35] as the as the protagonist in that the protag the antagonist yeah yeah i think he'd be a better bad
[03:11:41] guy the dude that gets his throat ripped out remember the og one well well here's the thing so
[03:11:48] my fantasy of a roadhouse remake would be a super dark and greedy one not like kind of cheesy like
[03:11:54] dark with drugs and like a real um explicit that was my og fantasy then i found out later that ronda
[03:12:01] rousey in her heyday was slated as dalton as a remake of roadhouse where you know it's a woman
[03:12:10] protagonist that's what i that's the intel i got that's what back in the day was a long time ago
[03:12:14] and then yes recently maybe that's why because my vision of roadhouse was more like an actual
[03:12:21] fighter guy yeah and maybe it was just embedded in my brain and you don't see women bouncers so it's
[03:12:27] like that's i think a big time a mistake when you're trying to sell a certain story and it's like
[03:12:32] okay let's put like a different person in that role that it's like bruh that's not that realistic
[03:12:38] as a woman bouncer they're so rare so unless it's about the rarity of women bouncers cool but it's
[03:12:43] like it's not as believable you know you know how like you get like a um like a like if you get a
[03:12:49] ninja will say but the ninja is a 10 year old boy it's like i see what you're doing but it's like
[03:12:56] bad ninjas aren't 10 year old boys typically ninjas is like a trained decades of training guy that's
[03:13:03] who we're gonna be you see what i'm saying anyway so when i saw khanan migreger i was like hey i i
[03:13:08] feel like that's viable that's what i thought i think character wise i think you would have more fun
[03:13:13] playing like a bad guy i think you're right i think you're the antagonist because even though
[03:13:20] he's good he's that good at talking smack he's kind of good he's kind of good at being a bad guy
[03:13:26] in mma but also has like the good side right they love him he's not just a pure heal you know what
[03:13:34] they term heal is right from wrestling like like chael sonan was duty he was you know bad guy
[03:13:40] ink bro and he was so good at it and and connor plays that role a little bit but he's not but
[03:13:48] he still does it with like a nice side and he has a lot of you know a lot of positivity to him
[03:13:55] and so if he was allowed to just go off and just be bad he'd have a good time with it well here's
[03:14:00] the thing and and i didn't realize this until it was actually like told to me where the i felt it
[03:14:07] but i never knew this as a specific thing so the best bad guys in history are guys that we like
[03:14:12] like guys who are we're like hey sure he's a bad guy but oh i kind of want to be like him
[03:14:17] and that always has to have a positive element to it like darth vader um like they're they're usually
[03:14:23] like guys who are like sure they're all you know you just gave you just gave me a list of one
[03:14:30] you started counting your fingers too like you're gonna have at least five give me a list of one
[03:14:36] and it's freaking darth vader good job he was the first guy that came to all right uh well you tell
[03:14:41] me who who's who's like an iconic bad guy anton sugar okay uh yeah okay so stoicism he's stoic
[03:14:49] dude right in touch with or able to control his emotions super successful like there's all these
[03:14:56] elements of him that are like and then there's one or two really i mean they're significant but this
[03:15:00] is usually just one or two bad elements of them and in fact you get bad guys who some some
[03:15:05] movies they do on purpose and they do it well where if they want you to really not like a bad guy
[03:15:11] like they'll make him like kind of weasley or someone who like you wouldn't want to like listen
[03:15:16] to her hang out with in fact you'd really rather be quiet and not show up to the party kind of a
[03:15:21] thing but usually the good bad guys you're like oh as long as he liked me i would like to hang out
[03:15:26] with that guy or be like that guy when you think about it so you get a conor mcgregor as the bad
[03:15:31] guy yeah perfect and you said trail sonan trail sonan yeah he is a little bit more on the like
[03:15:37] antagonistic side for sure but he has a lot of those elements he's smart he's funny like right
[03:15:42] you kind of like dude some of the trail sonan uh like smack talking i don't know it entered the
[03:15:48] algorithm it entered my algorithm oh yeah and he was freaking epic man he was he was just epic
[03:15:55] as smack talker and just i think he might be the king yeah i think he might actually be the the
[03:16:03] best smack talker of all time anything it got fourth round fifth round fifth round he talked
[03:16:11] the biggest smack to anderson silva oh and and he was in the fifth round and there was a minute left
[03:16:17] man and he got caught brutal that was savage that was savage that was a that was well for i was rooting
[03:16:26] you know for him what was his nickname the american bad guy ink or something well bad guy ink is like
[03:16:33] his uh video channel he's got a youtube channel and he talks you know about mma and stuff like that
[03:16:40] yeah but uh he would say he's a gangster from westland ordin yeah he's like i'm an american
[03:16:47] i'm a gangster he's freaking legit it's so funny i've been to his house before for yeah for for
[03:16:52] interview stuff okay so um and this is back in the new channel yeah a little bit you guys go way back
[03:16:58] yeah like when i last like for example last time i saw him a different thing we remembered each other
[03:17:03] for sure but i don't you know i don't have a month's beat down nothing like this but yes i've been
[03:17:08] to his house when i went to it was just me and yeah that's a real nice place he lives in that whole
