[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 355 with Echo Charles and me,
[00:00:04] Jocko Willink.
[00:00:05] Good evening Echo.
[00:00:06] Good evening.
[00:00:07] So it was about 2009 or 2010, I think.
[00:00:14] And I'm in San Diego and that year in San Diego,
[00:00:18] whatever year this was, the ADCC trials were in San Diego.
[00:00:23] So this is the championship of Jiu Jitsu,
[00:00:27] of submission grappling and you have to do,
[00:00:31] you have to get qualified to go there
[00:00:33] and they have a bunch of competitions all over the world
[00:00:36] and the North American qualifier happened to be in San Diego.
[00:00:40] So I went of course and I brought my son with me.
[00:00:45] So I got my son with me and he's like seven or eight years
[00:00:50] old but he trains all the time so he knows what's up.
[00:00:53] And they announce who's next up in this one mat
[00:00:57] and they go, oh, next up is gonna be some,
[00:00:59] blah, blah, blah, some guy versus Jeff Glover.
[00:01:04] And I was like, I told my son, I looked at him, I go,
[00:01:07] hey, I go, this guy, we're going to that mat
[00:01:11] to watch this guy, Jeff Glover.
[00:01:12] I said, he's crazy.
[00:01:15] And so we run over to that mat, we start watching
[00:01:19] and sure enough, this guy, Jeff Glover.
[00:01:21] And I knew Jeff Glover because we started competing
[00:01:24] in Jiu Jitsu around the same time.
[00:01:25] As a matter of fact, I have a sheet of paper
[00:01:30] that has the champions of like grappling games
[00:01:36] or one of these old school, Joe Morier,
[00:01:37] one of these old school Jiu Jitsu tournaments
[00:01:40] and the first place winner of the white belts is Jeff Glover.
[00:01:43] The first place winner of the blue belts is me
[00:01:47] and then Dean Lister's like the purple belt
[00:01:49] or something along those lines, but it's pretty cool, right?
[00:01:52] So anyways, Jeff Glover comes out and what does he do?
[00:01:54] He like, does donkey guard, which means he basically
[00:01:59] turns his back on his opponent, goes on all fours,
[00:02:02] runs at the dude backwards and engages him
[00:02:06] and then 14 seconds later, he's got the guy
[00:02:08] and he'll hook in the guy taps.
[00:02:11] And my son, who again, he's like seven or eight years old,
[00:02:14] he looks at me and he goes,
[00:02:17] when you said he was crazy, I thought you meant crazy.
[00:02:20] Ah, I didn't know you meant crazy.
[00:02:26] So that was it.
[00:02:27] That was kind of a moment in that I really remember
[00:02:32] about Jeff Glover and then luckily for me
[00:02:35] and luckily for everyone in San Diego,
[00:02:37] Jeff Glover came down and actually taught Jiu Jitsu
[00:02:41] at Victory MMA for five years.
[00:02:45] For five years we had Jeff Glover here teaching.
[00:02:49] Jeff Glover, he ended up, he's done all kinds of stuff.
[00:02:53] He was the Pan Am Champ 2005, the Pan Am Champ 2006,
[00:02:57] 2007, No Gi World Champion, 2008, No Gi Silver Medalist.
[00:03:02] 27 time champion of grapplers' quests.
[00:03:06] Maybe it's more, but a lot.
[00:03:09] 27 times champion of grapplers' quest
[00:03:13] and we are super stoked to have Jeff Glover here
[00:03:18] on the podcast to talk to us tonight.
[00:03:20] Jeff, what's happening?
[00:03:22] Thank you, Django.
[00:03:23] Thanks for coming down.
[00:03:24] Also with him is Pete Lettsoce,
[00:03:28] which who you probably don't know.
[00:03:29] You probably don't know who Pete Lettsoce is,
[00:03:31] but that's okay, you might know who Pete the Greek is.
[00:03:34] Pete the Greek, another Jiu Jitsu legend.
[00:03:39] 1999 and 2000 Pan Am third place as a blue belt.
[00:03:45] 2001 great Gracie Invitational Champion.
[00:03:48] 2002, Sao Paulo State Champion.
[00:03:50] 2003 Pan Am Champion, purple belt.
[00:03:53] Got his black belt in 2006 under the Carlson Gracie side
[00:04:00] of the family and you know what that means.
[00:04:02] Carlson Gracie Jr.
[00:04:05] 2006, Pete the Greek opened his academy up in Chicago.
[00:04:09] He's famous in the Jiu Jitsu world,
[00:04:12] featured in the book The Gracie Way.
[00:04:14] He's without a doubt the best wrist locker in the world,
[00:04:18] making sure that the world is not ignoring
[00:04:20] that 5% of the body.
[00:04:22] Pete the Greek, thanks for coming down man.
[00:04:24] Hey, thank you sir.
[00:04:26] Thanks, I call.
[00:04:27] Thanks, Jeff.
[00:04:29] So here we are, two Jiu Jitsu legends in the house.
[00:04:32] Nice for me, you know, I love Jiu Jitsu.
[00:04:35] I love Jiu Jitsu.
[00:04:37] And so it's nice for me to come in here
[00:04:38] and just be able to talk about Jiu Jitsu.
[00:04:40] But let's talk about you guys
[00:04:41] and how you guys got started in the game.
[00:04:44] Jeff, so tell us a little bit like where'd you grow up?
[00:04:49] What'd your parents, what'd your parents do?
[00:04:51] My mom was a nurse and my dad had all kinds of different jobs
[00:04:55] and they ended up in Santa Barbara,
[00:04:59] which is where I found Jiu Jitsu.
[00:05:00] Like 16 I started.
[00:05:03] You were 16 when you started.
[00:05:04] And everyone thought I was like 12.
[00:05:05] Yeah, cause you still look like you're 16 now.
[00:05:07] I'm wearing a beautiful face, thank you.
[00:05:12] What, how'd you get to the gym?
[00:05:13] What happened?
[00:05:15] Well, Francia actually moved next door to my mom's house.
[00:05:20] Him and his whole Brazilian family.
[00:05:23] There was like 12 of them.
[00:05:24] They all moved into a house together.
[00:05:26] And like next door neighbors?
[00:05:28] Yeah, like right there.
[00:05:30] The same block that Bill Cooper lived on.
[00:05:33] And Bill wasn't even in the scene yet,
[00:05:36] but he lived in that neighborhood and was one of the kids.
[00:05:39] But yeah, Francia.
[00:05:41] So then when he came over and was like,
[00:05:42] you needed to learn how to fight, boy?
[00:05:44] I went over there to make friends, you know,
[00:05:46] and knocked on their door.
[00:05:48] That's kind of how it was in that neighborhood.
[00:05:49] You know, like it was a nice spot.
[00:05:51] It was a nice place to live.
[00:05:53] And yeah, I knocked on the door, he opened the door
[00:05:57] and like he had a TV playing UFC in the background.
[00:06:01] What year is this?
[00:06:02] I mean, this was like 1998.
[00:06:04] Okay.
[00:06:04] 1998 or nine.
[00:06:07] And yeah, it was just super crazy.
[00:06:09] Like he had, you know, the cauliflower,
[00:06:11] the shaved head, it's intimidating.
[00:06:13] You know, you remember the first time you saw
[00:06:14] a really good grappler and the way their head
[00:06:18] just kind of looks different, you know, in the ears.
[00:06:21] How did that happen?
[00:06:24] So did he say like, I teach Jiu-Jitsu,
[00:06:26] you're like, what is that karate?
[00:06:27] Like I don't want to do karate.
[00:06:29] That looks, you know, kind of way.
[00:06:30] I mean, I didn't understand a word he said
[00:06:32] for the first six months.
[00:06:33] All I know is he was just very persuasive
[00:06:36] and was pulling and pushing me places.
[00:06:38] And I found myself on a mat with people trying to choke me.
[00:06:41] And it was awesome.
[00:06:43] And then how long was it before you were like
[00:06:45] in the Academy taking classes?
[00:06:47] Like the first week, that first week.
[00:06:50] After that first week, I like told him, I was like,
[00:06:52] dude, I want to do what you do.
[00:06:54] How long did it, did you realize the power of Jiu-Jitsu
[00:06:57] immediately?
[00:06:58] Were you just like, why is this happening?
[00:07:00] It didn't really, it didn't like dawn on me.
[00:07:02] None of that profound stuff was dawning on me.
[00:07:05] It was just so cool to have this like mentor guy
[00:07:10] telling me what to do that was like telling me
[00:07:12] to do pushups and yelling.
[00:07:14] Like, you know, he would kick me if I didn't do
[00:07:16] the calisthenics work he wanted me to do.
[00:07:18] You know, like I'd never had that in my life.
[00:07:20] And I was like, I didn't care what it was.
[00:07:22] If that dude was jumping off bridges,
[00:07:24] I would have jumped off bridges.
[00:07:25] But that dude did Jiu-Jitsu tournaments on the weekend
[00:07:28] and pushups during the week.
[00:07:30] So that's, you know, it was just really nice.
[00:07:33] Yeah.
[00:07:33] Did he open that Academy immediately?
[00:07:36] This is by the way, if anybody wants to know,
[00:07:37] this is Paragon Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:07:39] This is, this is Ricardo Franjia Miller,
[00:07:43] like epic instructor.
[00:07:45] And you know, obviously he has Jeff Glover under him,
[00:07:48] has Bill Cooper under him, has the other Glover
[00:07:52] under him, Tyrone Glover.
[00:07:54] So he's made a bunch of just incredible Jiu-Jitsu people.
[00:07:58] He's still up there at Paragon.
[00:07:59] Yeah.
[00:08:00] He has a big empire that he runs and operates out of Ventura
[00:08:05] and all over.
[00:08:06] My middle ghost.
[00:08:07] My middle daughter is now part of the Paragon empire
[00:08:10] because she goes to Slo.
[00:08:12] Yeah, Chris Lovato.
[00:08:13] He was one of the first guys that came into Franjia's
[00:08:17] Jiu-Jitsu world with like really good wrestling.
[00:08:21] And I used to fight Chris Lovato when I was like 17, 16, 17, 18.
[00:08:26] I was like one of the first like men Franjia would let me like
[00:08:28] fight.
[00:08:29] You know what I'm saying?
[00:08:30] And I got some good work out of that dude.
[00:08:33] Is that where you started developing good wrestling?
[00:08:36] Yeah, him and Tyrone, Tyrone came in, was like, all right,
[00:08:40] all these Brazilian names, all these judo names
[00:08:42] that you have for these takedowns,
[00:08:43] there's wrestling names for those too.
[00:08:45] You know, like double legs.
[00:08:46] That's not called Bayana, right?
[00:08:48] Is that what they called it?
[00:08:49] That's not called Bayana.
[00:08:50] That's called double leg.
[00:08:52] And he's like, and you change levels when you do it too.
[00:08:55] You don't just like, band over and grab it.
[00:08:58] And yeah, that was it.
[00:08:59] I started wrestling early, early, early.
[00:09:01] Yeah.
[00:09:02] Yeah, your wrestling is like underrated, right?
[00:09:06] Because people, you're so fluid on the mat
[00:09:08] that people might not recognize that.
[00:09:10] And your freaking creativity on the mat is ridiculous.
[00:09:14] It's ridiculous.
[00:09:15] And we'll get into like where that came from.
[00:09:17] But before, Pete.
[00:09:19] Yes, sir.
[00:09:19] How'd it go down?
[00:09:20] Well, first of all, you're from Chi-Town, right?
[00:09:22] Yes.
[00:09:23] So tell us a little bit about that.
[00:09:24] What's going on?
[00:09:25] Where are you from?
[00:09:26] My dad owned hot dog places.
[00:09:28] My dad was the first one to have a Euro since Chicago.
[00:09:31] So he'd put it on the spit.
[00:09:32] And we basically would flip restaurants.
[00:09:35] We'd flip hot dog places.
[00:09:36] Well, they're not a little standard.
[00:09:38] Like across the street at the malt shop.
[00:09:40] So it's basically those type of places, a little bit smaller.
[00:09:43] And so my dad would, we'd go and find a place.
[00:09:48] You know, we're Greek.
[00:09:49] We'd find someone struggling that they'd open them,
[00:09:52] not know how to do it.
[00:09:53] And we'd just take it over and flip it.
[00:09:54] You could either flip it in a few months, maybe a few years.
[00:09:57] But one that we kept was called Kings and Queens.
[00:10:00] And that was in Burwin, which is right next to Chicago.
[00:10:04] It's right on the border.
[00:10:05] And there was a karate place next to it.
[00:10:08] So my dad, my dad's tough.
[00:10:10] He's from Greece.
[00:10:12] His parents left him at 13 years old.
[00:10:14] He took care of himself since 13.
[00:10:16] They brought him to the United States at World War II.
[00:10:19] As soon as that was over, he was born in that time.
[00:10:22] So he's born in 1942.
[00:10:25] They brought him over.
[00:10:27] And his dad's like, you know what?
[00:10:28] I'm out.
[00:10:29] And he left and has left them.
[00:10:31] And so then he made it to Chicago.
[00:10:33] And he's a tough guy.
[00:10:34] So he always wanted to like, but he worked hard.
[00:10:36] So he never really worked out.
[00:10:37] He's like, I never worked out.
[00:10:38] I just worked.
[00:10:39] And the karate place next to the place,
[00:10:42] and my dad got his black belt.
[00:10:44] And he would just do private lessons with the master
[00:10:47] and all that.
[00:10:47] And so my dad would train me when I was born.
[00:10:49] He had me at like at 40 years old.
[00:10:50] So he'd be on his knees and fight me all the time
[00:10:54] and make me tough.
[00:10:55] And I don't know where he learned that,
[00:10:57] but it was like war training.
[00:10:59] So I started doing that.
[00:11:03] And then I went to the karate place, but I didn't like it.
[00:11:06] I would just show up for the belt promotion.
[00:11:08] I'm like, oh, these kids are getting promoted.
[00:11:10] I'll fight them.
[00:11:11] And then they'd get promoted, but they have to fight me.
[00:11:13] And the guy's like, look, man, you can't come back.
[00:11:17] You have to come to class.
[00:11:18] And I was good at floor hockey and baseball and stuff.
[00:11:23] And I found out that my cousin was like the best ice hockey
[00:11:26] player.
[00:11:26] His name's Chris Chagallos.
[00:11:27] He's one of the best ones.
[00:11:29] He's in the NHL.
[00:11:30] He lived in San Diego.
[00:11:32] And one of the kids was getting bullied.
[00:11:36] So the dad's like, no, no, we're going to teach you.
[00:11:38] And so they brought me on to ice hockey team.
[00:11:40] And I beat up the bully day one.
[00:11:42] I was never that big, but I was ready to fight people
[00:11:45] for my friends.
[00:11:46] And so bam.
[00:11:48] You still rated it for people for your sons.
[00:11:50] No, but Glover likes me.
[00:11:54] I really don't have to fight anyone, but it's just fun.
[00:11:57] It keeps you strong.
[00:11:58] And so next thing, what happened next?
[00:12:02] So what did you do to Glover?
[00:12:03] They brought me to ice hockey.
[00:12:04] So then ice hockey was cool, but I never really
[00:12:07] wanted to play ice hockey.
[00:12:08] They just want me there to beat up the bullies.
[00:12:10] So then bam, I saw UFC.
[00:12:12] It was like 1993 at my mom.
[00:12:13] I live at my mom growing up, my dad went back to Greece.
[00:12:16] And I looked at my mom and said, that's what I want to do.
[00:12:21] And she looked at me and was like, that's what you should do.
[00:12:24] That's the only mom in history.
[00:12:26] I was like, that looks good.
[00:12:27] I was like, this is perfect.
[00:12:28] So we just watch it.
[00:12:29] And we moved around.
[00:12:31] So I went to a few high schools.
[00:12:32] The last high school I went to, because we was called Montini.
[00:12:37] And they were really strong wrestling programs.
[00:12:40] So you see John Jones' wrestling coaches from there.
[00:12:43] They have like Izzy, Rusty, all these kids
[00:12:45] are top-notch wrestlers.
[00:12:46] And so I would go to wrestling rooms and fight them pretty much.
[00:12:49] I was like 14, 15.
[00:12:52] And I was able to do well against all of them.
[00:12:54] But I would never wrestle because it was ice hockey season.
[00:12:57] So then finally one of the Gracie's moved in town.
[00:13:00] And I couldn't drive yet.
[00:13:03] So then my mom's like, yeah.
[00:13:05] My mom had a heart attack.
[00:13:06] She still can't drive.
[00:13:07] My mom had a heart attack at 14.
[00:13:09] So I took the car, went to the Gracie's.
[00:13:11] And I met Carlson Gracie Jr. I'm like, whoa.
[00:13:14] I'm like, this guy's like, he's one of them.
[00:13:17] And then he didn't like to drive.
[00:13:19] So I became his personal driver.
[00:13:21] And then when I would drive him, people
[00:13:24] want to kick my butt because I show up with the coach.
[00:13:26] I'm always with him.
[00:13:28] And then that's when I met Carlson.
[00:13:29] Carlson would bring VTOR and everyone.
[00:13:31] I was so happy.
[00:13:32] I didn't even know there were Jiu-Jitsu tournaments.
[00:13:34] I just thought there was pride fighting and UFC.
[00:13:37] And then should I join?
[00:13:40] I became one of them.
[00:13:41] I came to the driver, just drove him everywhere.
[00:13:44] And then eventually.
[00:13:46] Eventually you went to Brazil, right?
[00:13:49] Yeah, eventually.
[00:13:49] How far along was that?
[00:13:51] So then there's a tournament going on.
[00:13:53] I lived in Ohio.
[00:13:54] So Carlson Gracie Jr. He was my best friend.
[00:13:57] He lived with me and he lived with me and my mom in Chicago.
[00:14:00] He lived alone.
[00:14:01] But you can't move from Rio de Janeiro to Chicago.
[00:14:03] It gets depressing.
[00:14:05] It's like I'm knocking on his door because my job
[00:14:08] was to pick him up and take him to class.
[00:14:11] Like people still have that.
[00:14:12] Like a lot of Jiu-Jitsu coaches, they
[00:14:13] love to have their students come, pick them up, hang out,
[00:14:16] and take them to class.
[00:14:17] So I'm knocking on the door and he's not answering.
[00:14:20] I kicked the door down.
[00:14:21] I'm like, look, come live with me and my mom.
[00:14:23] And then he lived with me and I started getting really serious
[00:14:26] about Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:14:27] I was about 16 at that point.
[00:14:29] What year was that?
[00:14:30] Around 96.
[00:14:32] Somewhere around there, 96, 97.
[00:14:34] So now you're training freaking hard.
[00:14:36] Hard.
[00:14:37] So I'm his driver.
[00:14:38] I show up to every single class.
[00:14:39] It's Carlson Gracie team.
[00:14:41] So we always have people from Brazil.
[00:14:44] Carlson Gracie always come visit us
[00:14:46] because O'Hara Airport is international.
[00:14:49] So before things were different, they could stop.
[00:14:52] Well, I think they can still do that.
[00:14:53] But were anybody to go to Brazil,
[00:14:54] wherever they'd always bring their team and stop in Chicago
[00:14:57] and visit a son and have to fight them?
[00:14:59] And I didn't even know the returnments existed.
[00:15:03] I'm like, whoa, these guys make a lot of money.
[00:15:05] No one on my team was broke.
[00:15:06] You just seen Vitor come and eating metrics.
[00:15:09] Packages.
[00:15:11] You didn't even eat food.
[00:15:12] I was like, mom, I want to be like this guy.
[00:15:14] My dad looked at him.
[00:15:15] He's like, oh, my dad didn't understand so much
[00:15:17] because I didn't live with him.
[00:15:18] But my mom understood.
[00:15:21] That's what I wanted to do.
[00:15:22] And so 110% behind me.
[00:15:25] And I never really had to pay for training.
[00:15:27] Because when you train like the way Jeff and I do,
[00:15:31] first we start off cleaning them.
[00:15:32] First we start off usually is training dummies.
[00:15:34] We help with privates.
[00:15:36] We help with everything.
[00:15:38] So God bless all that.
[00:15:39] And I start training.
[00:15:43] Shoot, I end up in Brazil.
[00:15:45] Next thing you know, I'm at the tournament in Ohio.
[00:15:48] So it's my first day of the Purple Belt.
[00:15:50] I should go as a blue belt.
[00:15:51] And Carl Sreed Jr. says, look, you're
[00:15:52] going as a Purple Belt throughout.
[00:15:53] I'm like, oh, yeah.
[00:15:55] I show up there.
[00:15:56] And I smash everyone.
[00:15:57] I do a couple of over-under moves.
[00:15:59] And I smash a lot of pressure.
[00:16:02] I beat everyone.
[00:16:04] And then a guy comes out of the crowd.
[00:16:06] His name's Henry Metta Morales.
[00:16:07] He's back in the day.
[00:16:08] He fought Rafael Cadero in the old Valle Tudo things.
[00:16:14] He comes out.
[00:16:16] And he's like, I want to go against you.
[00:16:18] Because I beat a Pedro Sauer guy.
[00:16:19] He's from Pedro Sauer.
[00:16:21] And then, bam, I'm like, come on, let's do it.
[00:16:25] And then I beat him.
[00:16:26] Boom.
[00:16:28] And then on the whole crowd.
[00:16:28] How many hours a day were you training?
[00:16:30] No, all day.
[00:16:31] I would just pick them up.
[00:16:33] I was just there.
[00:16:35] Jeff.
[00:16:35] He's a lifer.
[00:16:36] Jeff, how many hours a day?
[00:16:37] All day.
[00:16:38] Were you training once you started training?
[00:16:40] There's no hours.
[00:16:40] Not as much as Pete.
[00:16:41] Yeah, right.
[00:16:42] No way.
[00:16:43] He came after.
[00:16:44] Jeff came after.
[00:16:44] Because I met on the Met people in Brazil.
[00:16:47] And they had Scotty in them.
[00:16:50] And then so I had to train that hard because I wasn't accepted.
[00:16:54] My team destroyed.
[00:16:55] It fell apart.
[00:16:56] And so then I met Scotty.
[00:16:58] And Scotty had all the information.
[00:16:59] He had the digital cameras.
[00:17:00] OK, so hold on.
[00:17:01] You got Carlson Gracie team.
[00:17:04] Because a bunch of people left to make Brazilian top team, right?
[00:17:07] So I'm in this tournament in Ohio.
[00:17:09] And the coach is the referee is Cristiano Marcello.
[00:17:15] He's like the guy from Gracie Mitá.
[00:17:17] And he's coaching shoebox.
[00:17:19] He goes, tells Carlson to junior.
[00:17:21] This guy, if he moves to Brazil, no one will be able to beat him.
[00:17:24] They said that about you?
[00:17:26] Yeah, he was the ref when I won that.
[00:17:28] And so then, bam, I say to Juno, I said, I need to go to Brazil,
[00:17:33] dude.
[00:17:33] And he's like, sure, he's like, perfect.
[00:17:35] He calls his mom and I show up there on my backpack.
[00:17:39] And I'm like, what?
[00:17:40] What'd you tell your mom?
[00:17:41] I said, I'm going to my mom was happy.
[00:17:43] How old are you?
[00:17:44] I'm about 20.
[00:17:45] OK.
[00:17:46] My mom was happy.
[00:17:47] And what year is this?
[00:17:49] It's around 2000.
[00:17:51] Jack.
[00:17:52] OK.
[00:17:52] I go up and show up there.
[00:17:54] And I'm in junior.
[00:17:55] It's like my brother Carlson Gracie junior.
[00:17:58] He lived with me and stuff.
[00:17:59] We're like close, like real close, like me and Jeff.
[00:18:02] The mom never met me.
[00:18:03] And she just gave me, I said, Peach.
[00:18:04] Because my name in Portuguese is like a dog.
[00:18:06] Like pit bull, pi, pi, she gives me a hug.
[00:18:09] I give her a hug.
[00:18:11] We didn't know any.
[00:18:12] I couldn't understand anything.
[00:18:13] I knew some swear words.
[00:18:14] But so I show up.
[00:18:17] She works at the gym.
[00:18:18] Carlson's wife work at the gym 45.
[00:18:19] This is Jiu Jitsu crazy.
[00:18:21] So I walk over.
[00:18:22] They take me everywhere.
[00:18:23] This is Peach.
[00:18:24] Don't mess with them.
[00:18:25] And we meet all the bikers.
[00:18:27] They have all types of mutual friends that they know.
[00:18:31] They want to say, you know, this is Peach.
[00:18:33] Shoot.
[00:18:35] I was like, it was great.
[00:18:37] And then, yeah, but I showed up to the gym.
[00:18:40] And the third day they asked me to teach class.
[00:18:42] Because the team fell apart.
[00:18:44] And I was like, whoa.
[00:18:46] Like I didn't come here for this.
[00:18:48] So then I tell Carlson, I'm like, look, I want to train hard.
[00:18:54] Because they only had a few guys left.
[00:18:55] Most of the guys had stayed left.
[00:18:57] Some were like the loyal guys.
[00:18:58] But some of the guys had no one wanted.
[00:19:00] It's like they didn't go with them because no one wanted them.
[00:19:04] So I was like, whoa.
[00:19:06] I'm like, I can't stay here.
[00:19:07] So did you feel like it was like a political scenario?
[00:19:10] It was like a war.
[00:19:11] It was like show up to a war after your team just got
[00:19:13] massacred.
[00:19:14] And they're just like, they're like, whoa.
[00:19:17] So what was it that made you not want?
[00:19:21] There was one guy there.
[00:19:22] There was a few left.
[00:19:23] So was it that all the good guys left?
[00:19:25] They all left.
[00:19:25] There was like two or three of us left.
[00:19:27] One of them was so tough.
[00:19:30] He was a biker guy.
[00:19:32] I think he was like in the Hell's Angel or something.
[00:19:34] For sure he was.
[00:19:35] He went back to Brazilian top team to beat all them up
[00:19:38] and take them back.
[00:19:40] He was hectic.
[00:19:41] And he was doing a great job of doing that.
[00:19:43] But he got in trouble.
[00:19:44] And I don't know what happened to him.
[00:19:46] But he was actually doing it.
[00:19:48] He had one guy at the end willing to go there and beat them all
[00:19:51] up and take them back.
[00:19:53] And he was doing a good job of that.
[00:19:54] But it didn't work out.
[00:19:57] Things like that.
[00:19:58] Out of context, that whole idea of one guy going
[00:20:04] to another place beating people up and taking them back.
[00:20:07] I didn't know that.
[00:20:07] Yeah.
[00:20:08] It's Carlson Best from the name of Pocket.
[00:20:09] Street rules, son.
[00:20:10] The name is Pocket Tye.
[00:20:11] Well, actually I went through with Scotty.
[00:20:13] Scotty's like the American guy over there that films everything.
[00:20:16] Everyone loves him.
[00:20:17] But Scotty always has money around.
[00:20:19] So I show up to the Brazilian top team with Scotty one day.
[00:20:22] And he was like in enemy territory.
[00:20:24] I was like, whoa.
[00:20:24] I'm like, I saw all these guys.
[00:20:26] It was in the Bank of Brazil.
[00:20:29] Laborio's also worked for Bank of Brazil.
[00:20:32] So he hooked them up with, they had a country club where they trained.
[00:20:36] It was badass.
[00:20:37] I walked in there.
[00:20:38] I was like, whoa.
[00:20:38] There was like 80, 100 people.
[00:20:40] You seen like, I was like, whoa.
[00:20:42] And then the guy Navaliada, he was the guy with the tattoos.
[00:20:45] My best friend there.
[00:20:47] Well, because he was the last one left.
[00:20:50] He comes up and right away I'm in there.
[00:20:53] He stops the whole train.
[00:20:54] Because these guys are trying to sell his stuff.
[00:20:56] I'm with a bunch of American dudes and the little guys from top teams.
[00:21:00] Like, oh, buy this, buy that.
[00:21:02] I'm like, what?
[00:21:03] I'm not buying no top team, nothing.
[00:21:07] And then Navaliada sees me.
[00:21:08] Pete's here.
[00:21:09] He's the only brother in the room that'll fight with me against all you guys.
[00:21:14] You assume everyone will come back to the Carlson Racing team.
[00:21:18] He got hectic in there.
[00:21:19] I was like, yeah.
[00:21:21] And then he's like, don't worry, Pete.
[00:21:22] I'm like, all right.
[00:21:24] And we just stood there.
[00:21:25] And that was when I went to the top team.
[00:21:27] And then it was never the same after that.
[00:21:31] I could never join them.
[00:21:33] So I went to all the other schools.
[00:21:35] Carlson said, look, I know you went there.
[00:21:40] He's like, you can't go there again.
[00:21:41] You can go anywhere else.
[00:21:42] So then I went to every other team.
[00:21:44] I showed up Gracie Baez, train.
[00:21:46] I lived in Oswaldo, I was I trained at Ted today.
[00:21:49] I went to every other gym.
[00:21:50] No one really liked me, but they respected Carlson, like you here like Gringo.
[00:21:54] I was like, you're great.
[00:21:55] I'm trying to hear Gringo.
[00:21:56] I'm like, all right.
[00:21:58] The Carlson Gracie.
[00:21:59] I'm like, oh, OK.
[00:22:00] I know any Portuguese, but I knew that.
[00:22:02] That's how I mean it.
[00:22:02] It's about to get heated.
[00:22:04] And so Scotty, like.
[00:22:06] Was people at every school you went to, everyone tried to murder you?
[00:22:08] Yeah.
[00:22:09] And so Scotty, Scotty took all the videos of everything.
[00:22:13] And then like that's when Glover was being built at that point.
[00:22:16] This is when Scotty's making videos like Ringworm and all their videos.
[00:22:20] All the stuff.
[00:22:20] He had dang fever.
[00:22:22] Oh, that's right.
[00:22:23] That's right.
[00:22:23] Scotty got to make the videos because of me, because Carlson's best friend was Pocketa.
[00:22:27] He was the guy that filmed like Carlson's best friend.
[00:22:30] He's like, hey, what should you do?
[00:22:31] You should film.
[00:22:32] So Pocketa filmed everything.
[00:22:34] So then they showed up to the house.
[00:22:36] They're like, we don't like your friend Scotty.
[00:22:39] He films everything he's making.
[00:22:40] I was you can't just show up to Brazil and film everyone.
[00:22:43] And like we don't like him.
[00:22:46] They don't like when you do that here.
[00:22:47] Let alone.
[00:22:47] Yeah.
[00:22:48] So Scotty's blood hair blue.
[00:22:50] Especially back in the day, dude.
[00:22:50] Because back in the day, it wasn't like now, you know, you can go on BJJ Fanatics and just
[00:22:54] get like the best moves of anyone because they're, you know, you can go buy them.
[00:22:58] But back in the day, you couldn't buy the best moves from anyone because it was a secret
[00:23:03] inside that academy.
[00:23:04] No, because hectic because Scotty was from Health Gracie.
[00:23:06] Health made them nervous.
[00:23:08] Health still makes people a little nervous.
[00:23:11] But they didn't really care.
[00:23:12] They're like, you know, Scotty is Scotty.
[00:23:15] I got to go and I'm like, they're like, what do you think of him?
[00:23:19] In Brazil, they talk like that.
[00:23:20] They talk like family.
[00:23:21] What do you think of Scotty?
[00:23:22] I mean, Scotty's like my brother.
[00:23:24] And then look at Pocket towel.
[00:23:26] What do you think of Scotty?
[00:23:27] He's like Scotty's like my son.
[00:23:28] Oh, so bam, Scotty got to film everything at that point in time.
[00:23:34] Dude, I remember those movies back in the day.
[00:23:37] So Scotty and everything.
[00:23:38] They were like gold.
[00:23:39] At that point in time, they're like, they're telling about this Glover guy.
[00:23:41] I'm hearing about these guys back in the United States.
[00:23:44] I didn't give a shit.
[00:23:45] I was like, no, I'm in Brazil.
[00:23:47] I'm here.
[00:23:48] I don't care about anyone over there.
[00:23:49] I'm like, I was there on one thing.
[00:23:52] It was just a smash and like and do whatever I needed to do.
[00:23:57] Just as the only one left on my team.
[00:24:01] And so Glover was able to like, Scotty had a big part in Glover.
[00:24:08] I'll guarantee you, like he not going to tell you that.
[00:24:10] Well, he will tell you that like Fran Junior for sure.
[00:24:13] But Scotty gave you access to things that like not just me, though, like that's his
[00:24:17] hand.
[00:24:18] So the Scotty that worked out for people that have no idea that we're talking about.
[00:24:21] He's a hospital.
[00:24:22] Yeah, Scotty.
[00:24:23] But back in the yeah, now he has a hospital.
[00:24:25] What's the name of the hospital in Mexico?
[00:24:27] Chipsa Chipsa Chipsa.
[00:24:28] So he's doing a bunch of great work helping people with stem cells.
[00:24:33] If you're interested in that, you can fly into San Diego and go down across the border.
[00:24:37] This is way before this is dude.
[00:24:39] This is I mean, when I met those guys, yeah, when I met those guys, they were living in
[00:24:42] like a like a broken down loft up in San Francisco.
[00:24:46] Me and Dean List go up there for, you know, to go out, hang out, train and what not.
[00:24:50] Scotty was the coolest person at that point.
[00:24:52] And when you want to close people in America, as far as bringing people together and showing
[00:24:58] them a good time, like because not too many people were able to do that.
[00:25:01] How is he going to bring all these people right?
[00:25:03] Whatever we think from all shapes of life.
[00:25:06] You're crushing it Pete.
[00:25:07] Keep going.
[00:25:08] So what's the when did you meet Scotty then, Jeff?
[00:25:11] I mean, early he was already sponsoring Tyrone and Tyrone was like, you should look at my
[00:25:17] little white brother and Scotty was like, yeah, he's awesome.
[00:25:22] And then as a blue belt, I had an OTM patch on my G and you know, you.
[00:25:27] So you started competing as a white belt.
[00:25:30] You just started getting in there and you were you were so you must have been like 16,
[00:25:34] 17 years old when you started competing.
[00:25:36] Yeah.
[00:25:37] I think the first one I did was 17.
[00:25:40] There's something about you though, like the whole time that you've been doing Jiu Jitsu,
[00:25:47] you've been doing things that other people weren't doing.
[00:25:52] You've been doing things that at least as far as I know, it's kind of it's similar to
[00:25:55] Dean Lister.
[00:25:56] Like my brother Dean, you know, he was doing things that literally people were not doing
[00:26:02] and you're the same way as a white belt.
[00:26:06] I don't I don't know that early on I was like that.
[00:26:08] I think I was doing good job.
[00:26:12] I think I was doing Jiu Jitsu right and just with really good motor skills and amazing
[00:26:18] balance and it was just normal Jiu Jitsu done in a way that looks different.
[00:26:25] You know, Dean was actually doing different things.
[00:26:27] Dean was doing things that were like illegal.
[00:26:29] You know what I'm saying?
[00:26:31] I was taking the back triangles doing bow and arrow jokes, you know, I was doing attacks
[00:26:37] on the guard.
[00:26:38] I guess I guess you're right because now that I think about a little bit more, you were
[00:26:41] doing normal stuff, but damn, you're doing it in an abnormal way because even today you
[00:26:46] can go watch your videos from when you were a white belt or a blue belt and you're like
[00:26:49] that does not look like normal Jiu Jitsu, the fluidity of your movement.
[00:26:53] And you know, you were teaching class yesterday and you were going through this thing where
[00:26:57] you're like, Hey, just sit here and bounce back and forth and now and you're just talking
[00:27:00] about shadow wrestling.
[00:27:01] And so I'm sitting there like just doing what I'm told like, okay, we're bouncing back
[00:27:04] and forth and then you're saying like hit a single hit a double and then you're like,
[00:27:08] All right, stay in your square.
[00:27:09] But stay in your square.
[00:27:10] But now get get it down and half guard, get that deep heart.
[00:27:13] And you're doing this shadow like there's no other people and I'm watching you do it.
[00:27:17] And I was like, Damn, I'm a loser.
[00:27:19] I am such a loser because I can see that you're getting better with no partner.
[00:27:28] Just doing the moves, doing the movements.
[00:27:30] Your brain is just tapped into going through and making it happen.
[00:27:34] And I was like, God, I'm such a loser.
[00:27:38] And you're literally saying like, this is how you can get better.
[00:27:40] This is how you get, I'm thinking, God, I'm an idiot.
[00:27:42] How did I not be doing this for all these years?
[00:27:46] Going back to the story though, you started competing.
[00:27:49] You started kicking ass really early.
[00:27:51] I mean, you were freaking, you came onto the scene in a fury.
[00:27:55] Yeah.
[00:27:56] Yeah.
[00:27:57] I mean, for my against my peers, I always did really well.
[00:27:58] Hey, how many hours a day?
[00:27:59] Which you're like, Oh, P train more.
[00:28:01] You must have been training.
[00:28:02] Freakin.
[00:28:03] I mean, training, like, I think when people say training, they mean like rolling.
[00:28:07] Oh, I mean, on the mats.
[00:28:09] I mean, I was assisting in every class.
[00:28:12] All of Frenzy is private classes, has women's self-defense classes, his little kids classes.
[00:28:17] How long a day, how many hours a day were you at the academy?
[00:28:20] I mean, it was like, if I missed more than two classes, the whole like free Jiu-Jitsu
[00:28:24] thing was over.
[00:28:25] So you're, you're, you're doing five classes a day, four classes a day.
[00:28:31] Yeah.
[00:28:32] Every day.
[00:28:33] Yeah.
[00:28:34] But I didn't roll.
[00:28:35] No, you're not going to roll every single class, but that's the thing.
[00:28:36] And I noticed there's another thing about you.
[00:28:39] You have a way of rolling that is it's not rolling fully, but it's rolling.
[00:28:47] It's like a playful role where you're going through wild positions and crazy things are
[00:28:51] happening and that's another thing.
[00:28:53] And you know, it's, I used to watch you do this when you taught here and I'd be like,
[00:28:56] oh yeah, that's awesome.
[00:28:57] Yeah.
[00:28:58] And I kind of thought of it as like a cool thing.
[00:29:00] And then I just realized when you were here and I was watching, actually I was watching
[00:29:02] you and Pete roll and I was like, oh, this is how this bastard's getting so good because
[00:29:07] he's trying all this wild stuff against a partner that he's kind of playing with that
[00:29:11] playing together.
[00:29:12] Yeah.
[00:29:13] And that's a different thing.
[00:29:14] And I remember that actually Dean and I used to do that.
[00:29:16] Dean and I would do that where we're sort of going.
[00:29:21] But we're also kind of just playing, but if it's going to work, you can kind of tell
[00:29:26] it's going to work.
[00:29:27] And if it's not going to work, you can tell it's not going to work, but you don't get
[00:29:28] all locked up in one position and sit there across the side for 48 minutes, which there's
[00:29:33] not much progress.
[00:29:34] You have to play before you can fight.
[00:29:35] It's like in boxing.
[00:29:37] A boxing coach won't hold paths for you unless you're good at shadow boxing and bag work
[00:29:41] first because you're going to fucking hit them.
[00:29:44] You know, you're going to hurt them.
[00:29:45] As a Jiu-Jitsu coach, I don't want to work with a Jiu-Jitsu student that doesn't have
[00:29:49] a good stance.
[00:29:51] I'm like, let me see your stance.
[00:29:52] And they're like, I don't know what to do with my hands.
[00:29:54] I'm like, whoa, you're not, I'm not rolling with that dude.
[00:29:57] He's going to hurt me.
[00:29:58] And if I roll with him, I'm going to only, only win.
[00:30:02] There's no like letting this dude get anything because he's going to do it wrong and hurt
[00:30:05] me.
[00:30:06] You know what I'm saying?
[00:30:07] And then I start feeling bad because I'm just breaking some dude off like as hard as
[00:30:10] I can.
[00:30:11] And he's all brand new and he doesn't understand.
[00:30:13] I'm just trying not to get hurt.
[00:30:14] Yeah.
[00:30:15] Well, that was another interesting thing you told me one time.
[00:30:18] You said, Hey, for me, the easiest people for me, Jeff Glover to go against is like
[00:30:23] big muscle guys.
[00:30:25] And I witnessed that countless times where like some big jack guy would come in here
[00:30:30] and you could see, you know, whatever he's thinking he's hanging onto is not there anymore
[00:30:35] like a half a second later, it's gone.
[00:30:37] You're all of a sudden slipping over there, slipping over there.
[00:30:41] How about your flexibility, bro?
[00:30:43] You got some wild flexibility.
[00:30:45] How much of that is natural and how much of it is work?
[00:30:47] I mean, it's all natural.
[00:30:50] I don't stretch.
[00:30:52] Never stretched.
[00:30:53] No.
[00:30:54] God.
[00:30:55] That's crazy.
[00:30:56] You ever see me stretch Pete?
[00:30:58] He just like does like freak show stretches just to show people like how twists his ankles
[00:31:03] around.
[00:31:04] But as far as like going out there and doing a yoga, we went to like meet some chicks one
[00:31:09] time.
[00:31:10] How do I was it?
[00:31:13] No, I mean, he was more flexible than everyone.
[00:31:15] Like we're not falling for that again.
[00:31:18] No.
[00:31:19] So, you know, Glover is one of those people, you know, if you tell someone, you know, not
[00:31:23] to use your strength, but then I tell them not to use your flexibility.
[00:31:28] So then, you know, we all have talents that we should.
[00:31:31] But yeah, the way Glover and I play is, we warm each other up in case we really have to
[00:31:39] do something is for most people.
[00:31:42] See, we're expecting to be rolling and then some dude wants to challenge us.
[00:31:47] So we're warming ourselves up at all times as opposed to hurting each other.
[00:31:52] And then someone walks in the room and then what?
[00:31:54] Yeah.
[00:31:55] Then we're already hurt.
[00:31:56] Like the way we play, he's getting sharper.
[00:31:59] I'm getting sharper.
[00:32:01] And then if we really got to do it, then we do it.
[00:32:05] We're sharpening these things pretty much.
[00:32:07] We're not, we're not putting in battle because we already know what it could do.
[00:32:11] But we'll keep it sharp.
[00:32:14] This thing is pretty sharp.
[00:32:15] No, that one's not sharp at all.
[00:32:17] Yeah.
[00:32:18] So, so Jeff, you're saying, you know, white belt, blue belt, you're kind of doing normal
[00:32:25] jiu-jitsu moves.
[00:32:26] You're just doing them super fluid.
[00:32:27] And again, anybody go watch YouTube or whatever and check out some of this stuff.
[00:32:30] Well, what's the first thing you remember kind of, kind of thinking, Hey, I'm making
[00:32:36] this up.
[00:32:37] This is new.
[00:32:38] I'm creating this thing right now.
[00:32:42] I don't know that I did it intentionally.
[00:32:44] It would be somebody else pointing it out to me and be like, Hey, did you notice you
[00:32:48] did this when you rolled?
[00:32:49] And I'd be like, No, I have no idea what just happened.
[00:32:52] I was just, you know, responding to all the training that Fringio put me through.
[00:32:56] And it would just work, you know,
[00:32:59] You're a deep half guard.
[00:33:01] Is that, I mean, you're definitely known for the deep half guard, especially back in
[00:33:06] the day.
[00:33:08] Was that something that you were like, all of a sudden you realized you had this position?
[00:33:11] I remember you teaching me deep half guard.
[00:33:16] And the coolest thing was that you do deep half guard to me and you just like sort of
[00:33:20] pose the question like, What, what are you going to do?
[00:33:23] Jocko, because you're 225 pounds and where are you going to go?
[00:33:27] And you have, you have control of my leg.
[00:33:31] It's like your whole body is on my leg, but then I can't do anything.
[00:33:36] Was the deep half guard.
[00:33:37] Is that, was that the first thing that you started getting recognized for?
[00:33:42] As like your own thing?
[00:33:43] It was our team's thing.
[00:33:45] Frangio used it just as much as I did.
[00:33:48] So did Bill.
[00:33:49] So did Tyrone.
[00:33:50] Anybody who was winning tournaments from Paragon team was using that fucking suite.
[00:33:56] But I think, I think what I did was I recognized that all the sweeps are not just randomly used.
[00:34:06] It works best when you have an initial off balancing movement.
[00:34:10] And I realized at that point that I was doing that I was going into deep half guard and
[00:34:14] just trying random moves and hoping they would work.
[00:34:17] And often they would.
[00:34:18] They would oftentimes work.
[00:34:19] I would be like, let me try this random move and boom, the guy would get swept.
[00:34:22] Like, Oh, cool.
[00:34:23] And then would you load that into your repertoire?
[00:34:25] Yeah.
[00:34:26] I was like, Okay, now I got another suite.
[00:34:28] Well, I, I do it's, I had the light bulb when I realized it was only three sweeps.
[00:34:32] I thought that it was like 15, 20 different things I had to learn when I found out that,
[00:34:37] Oh my God, I keep repeating these three things over and over again.
[00:34:40] And it took me so long.
[00:34:42] I used to do like three months.
[00:34:43] So it would focus on three months on one move.
[00:34:46] Every time I rolled with somebody, I was only doing on a plot for three months.
[00:34:49] And at the end of three months, I was, I was fricking, I hated that move.
[00:34:54] I felt like a cheater.
[00:34:55] If I was, I was so good at it that it's, it wasn't fun anymore.
[00:34:58] You know what I'm saying?
[00:34:59] When you got a move that just works for you so well, you feel like you're cheating, you
[00:35:02] know, doing it to wipe out.
[00:35:03] So you're like, how good do I really feel about that?
[00:35:06] You know what I'm saying?
[00:35:07] I'm sitting the bar higher for myself.
[00:35:08] So it didn't get like that with deep half guard.
[00:35:10] It got to like year three and four.
[00:35:11] And I was still like excited to use it every time I rolled.
[00:35:15] And it was making life so easy.
[00:35:17] And you started seeing the clarity and the simplicity actually get narrowed down over
[00:35:22] time because you thought the half guard was so many different moves, but really you can
[00:35:26] sweep them to the left.
[00:35:28] You can sweep them to the right or you can come out the back.
[00:35:30] That's kind of what it is.
[00:35:31] Basically, yeah, it's always going to be a variation of one of three moves.
[00:35:35] And they all set each other up.
[00:35:37] They're all, yeah.
[00:35:38] There's a whole, there's a whole thing that's really easy to learn.
[00:35:41] You know, if I can grab your leg, I can show it to you and explain it to you in like five
[00:35:45] minutes.
[00:35:46] And most guard systems do not take five minutes to explain.
[00:35:50] Most guard systems, you need like two hours.
[00:35:52] And I can honestly give you the gist of this system in like under 10.
[00:35:56] No, it's.
[00:35:57] Pete explains it better than I do, to be honest with you.
[00:35:59] And it's one of those things that when I, when you, when you were teaching here and
[00:36:02] I was like, this stuff is, it's crazy how it is pretty simple.
[00:36:07] I mean, when you, you were already to the point when you came here, I mean, you were
[00:36:10] a freaking champion and everything else.
[00:36:11] So you were not only highly proficient at the move, you're also highly proficient at teaching
[00:36:17] it and all the little drills.
[00:36:19] Another thing that Jeff Glover has drills, little physical drills that make you better
[00:36:26] at the movement that make you better at jujitsu.
[00:36:31] Motor skills.
[00:36:32] Somebody said that to me the other day.
[00:36:33] They're like, Glover, you got motor skills.
[00:36:35] And I was like, yeah, I said that to you the other day when you were teaching.
[00:36:41] No, what I said was, I feel like if Jeff Glover's watching me try to do one of his moves, he
[00:36:47] just thinks this guy's an idiot.
[00:36:49] Like this guy doesn't, doesn't have any motor skills.
[00:36:54] So you're in this competition mode.
[00:36:56] So now we're talking like, what is it now?
[00:37:00] The year 2000, 2001, now you're competing all the time, 2002, 2003, you're mopping up competitions.
[00:37:07] The other thing that's rad about Jeff Glover is what's Jeff Glover's weight class?
[00:37:14] Whatever.
[00:37:15] Dude, all those old like grappling quest videos where you're going in against guys that are
[00:37:19] 300 pounds, literally 300 pounds, 240 pounds.
[00:37:23] Back to big giant dudes.
[00:37:25] What was the story behind that?
[00:37:26] You just didn't give a shit.
[00:37:28] Deep half garden.
[00:37:29] Deep half garden.
[00:37:30] The bigger they get, the more I use the deep half garden.
[00:37:32] Yeah.
[00:37:33] Come out the back door.
[00:37:34] Yeah.
[00:37:35] No problem.
[00:37:36] Up on a single.
[00:37:37] Or up on any of them.
[00:37:38] They all work really well.
[00:37:39] See, if not, when you're caught in that quarter guard position, when someone's trying to mount
[00:37:42] you, you, if you look at the last ADCC with the super fight of Gordon versus Galvan, Gordon
[00:37:50] had him trapped in the quarter guard.
[00:37:53] So, Galvan had two options or three.
[00:37:56] He could either accept the mount, turn stomach down, give the choke, or he could have went
[00:38:03] and did Jeff Glover right there and dive under the leg and went deep half garden.
[00:38:07] That's something you got to be kind of crazy to do.
[00:38:10] It's the deep half.
[00:38:11] The way I teach the deep half garden, you'll never get mounted again.
[00:38:14] You don't get mounted and you don't get your back taken.
[00:38:16] It's the anti-mount pretty much.
[00:38:17] It's anti this.
[00:38:18] It's how Jiu-Jitsu used to be when we all first started.
[00:38:21] It used to be you go from close guard to mount.
[00:38:24] There's none of this knee slide to side control shit first.
[00:38:27] It was go from close guard to mount.
[00:38:29] When dudes are good at that, it fucking sucks.
[00:38:31] That's what Roger Gracie does.
[00:38:33] And that's what Gordon's so good at that now.
[00:38:35] He's so good at just going straight to mount, dude.
[00:38:37] You know what I'm saying?
[00:38:38] And that's what I used to have to defend with Franjia all the time.
[00:38:41] And Franjia gave up on trying to tell students to do that shit.
[00:38:44] Because everybody on the grappling scene, they were all like, oh, knee slide to side mount.
[00:38:48] And he was like, that's whack.
[00:38:49] Go to mount.
[00:38:50] And people were like, that's harder.
[00:38:51] And he's like, at first it's harder.
[00:38:53] But the end results dog, you get a mount where the submission is just right there now.
[00:38:57] It's like a checkmate type mount.
[00:38:59] And he was like, whatever.
[00:39:00] Nobody wants to listen to me.
[00:39:01] And we were at the whole community.
[00:39:02] We were all like knee slides, knee slides.
[00:39:03] And now Gordon's showing you guys knee slides.
[00:39:05] Mount.
[00:39:06] Right?
[00:39:07] So this deep half guard is designed to deal with that shit.
[00:39:11] To get under that mount.
[00:39:12] To deal with that shit right there.
[00:39:15] That's how Glover's able to beat these big guys because he can either stay there and
[00:39:19] get trapped and mounted or he can dive under and diving under scary because they're right
[00:39:25] above you.
[00:39:27] And if you don't know what you're doing right there, most people try it and then they kind
[00:39:31] of get a, was it claustrophobic, right?
[00:39:33] Yeah.
[00:39:34] They get claustrophobic and bail on it.
[00:39:35] They panic and they bail on it.
[00:39:36] They panic and they're like, it doesn't work.
[00:39:38] It doesn't work.
[00:39:39] Yeah.
[00:39:40] Well, that's another thing you and I were talking about the other day, Jeff, is when you first
[00:39:42] try a move in Jiu Jitsu, it's not going to work.
[00:39:46] I mean, it may work like 10% of the time, but it's the same thing with anything in life.
[00:39:51] When you incorporate something new into your life, if you're working at a, at a business
[00:39:56] and you incorporate some new process at first, it's going to be less efficient.
[00:40:01] That's the way it works.
[00:40:02] So you're going to, no one knows exactly how to do the process or everyone's kind of messing
[00:40:05] it up and they're taking a little longer.
[00:40:08] And so you're going to get less efficient when you first start trying a new process
[00:40:10] in a business.
[00:40:11] Same thing in Jiu Jitsu.
[00:40:12] You bring some new moving to Jiu Jitsu.
[00:40:16] It's going to make you worse for a while.
[00:40:19] And I said for a while, you were like three months because you were teaching a whole
[00:40:24] another series the other day.
[00:40:27] And I said to you, I'm like, bro, I'm going to get my back taken a lot when I start doing
[00:40:31] this.
[00:40:32] And you go, yeah, you are.
[00:40:33] And I was like, yeah, cool.
[00:40:34] That's the way it is.
[00:40:35] And I got done.
[00:40:36] I was rolling and I was like, I got my back to back taken.
[00:40:38] And you were like, yeah, you're going to keep getting your back taken for a while.
[00:40:42] And I remember there was a position I used to teach and and I would teach it to people.
[00:40:46] For me, it was like my main go to position of how to pass guard.
[00:40:50] And it was like kind of unstoppable.
[00:40:52] And I would teach it to people and then I'd see them try and do it.
[00:40:55] They'd be all awkward and all off balance and stuff.
[00:41:00] And I would say to them, they'd be like, I feel like I'm going to get swept and they
[00:41:03] would get swept.
[00:41:04] And I'd say, hey, man, you got to get comfortable in this position first.
[00:41:07] Like it's going to take you a while to get to where you can just be here and just be like,
[00:41:11] you know, nothing's going to happen.
[00:41:12] You can't try and go me.
[00:41:13] You can't arm lock me.
[00:41:14] You can't sweep me.
[00:41:15] I'm totally comfortable here and I'm going to pass your guard.
[00:41:16] But it but it takes a while to get used to that stuff.
[00:41:20] In order to do that, you got to put your ego in check.
[00:41:22] I remember watching you, Jeff, for all you like, people are just getting, you're just
[00:41:27] giving up a rear naked choke.
[00:41:30] 80% of the time you get out 20% of the time you tap and you're like, cool, let's roll
[00:41:35] again.
[00:41:36] Yeah.
[00:41:37] Yeah, well, I was getting paid in those classes, you know, but that if you're not doing that,
[00:41:46] you're not going to improve.
[00:41:47] Yeah.
[00:41:48] I don't, you know, I like, I like making the students truly believe they got coach.
[00:41:56] You know, like, like, like they go home.
[00:41:58] They're like, did I tap coach today?
[00:42:04] You know, he legit like tapped hard and everything and he was struggling, grunting.
[00:42:09] And I don't take time to explain to them whatever they want to ask.
[00:42:12] Did I really get you?
[00:42:13] I'll be like, you know, explain it to them.
[00:42:14] But if they don't ask, I let them go home.
[00:42:16] I'm not going to be like, I let you by the way, I let you get that by the way, just so
[00:42:20] you know.
[00:42:21] Like, I'm like, done.
[00:42:23] Good job today, dude.
[00:42:24] You got to match their energy almost match their heartbeat.
[00:42:28] If they start going harder, we start going harder.
[00:42:32] All right.
[00:42:34] So when did you, what was like the highlight of your competition career, Pete?
[00:42:40] Well, then, well, okay.
[00:42:42] So let's see, besides Rafael Lovato and myself, there wasn't too many Americans pretty much
[00:42:49] going to Brazil.
[00:42:50] Rafael would come out and visit all the time.
[00:42:52] His dad was cool.
[00:42:54] He wouldn't live in Brazil, but he'd come out and so he, him and I were able to do well
[00:43:00] out there.
[00:43:02] And so they put us in the great kid, we would usually get ripped off in tournaments.
[00:43:06] Like we would, I would compete more than him, but the Brazilians liked us because we would
[00:43:12] get ripped off.
[00:43:13] There was no internet so much.
[00:43:14] And, you know, like the last time I competed in Brazil's against Brawlio Stima and it was
[00:43:20] like my fifth match of the world.
[00:43:22] And I should have won, but then they gave him a time out.
[00:43:25] They called the referee.
[00:43:26] He brought over an oxygen tank right after I deep half guard swept them.
[00:43:30] I dumped them, then they called a time out.
[00:43:33] They brought him all the action.
[00:43:34] They put him in his best move.
[00:43:35] I didn't even know what was going on.
[00:43:38] I was like, Carlson came out.
[00:43:41] He made it switch to ref.
[00:43:43] He threw out one of his cousins, the referee.
[00:43:46] And then it was, it was, you just realized like in these type of games, you could get
[00:43:53] cheated.
[00:43:54] They fed him some assaí.
[00:43:57] In the tournament, basically we didn't, in those tournaments back in the day, you just
[00:44:02] stuffed someone in a position you were good at and the time would run out and you'd win.
[00:44:08] That's how I wouldn't have the flash.
[00:44:09] He wins because I would beat people that I wasn't supposed to beat.
[00:44:13] I would go to Brazil and beat all those guys and they would never expect that.
[00:44:18] And I don't even remember most of their names, but there was a lot of good ones and all the
[00:44:21] Brazilians knew me.
[00:44:23] And then when I came back to Chicago, Carlson had moved to Chicago, but the level was low
[00:44:29] because in Chicago.
[00:44:30] Yeah.
[00:44:31] It was just like regular people training.
[00:44:34] And so I, BJ Penn had called me.
[00:44:36] He's one of the friends at Scotty and I went over there and I was, I was living with BJ
[00:44:39] Penn and that, that was a good highlight in Hawaii.
[00:44:42] In Hawaii.
[00:44:43] In Hawaii.
[00:44:44] And he looked, oh, okay.
[00:44:45] So I lived over there for a while.
[00:44:46] So I'm actually Pete, the Greek, Brazilian, Sicilian, Peruvian, Hawaiian.
[00:44:50] There's a whole bunch of them.
[00:44:52] So I lived over there in Hawaii in Hilo.
[00:44:54] And Jack Daniel, Jack Daniel Hill.
[00:44:58] He was another guy that lived over there and trained like six hours a day.
[00:45:04] Yeah.
[00:45:05] It was just me and BJ Penn all day, all day.
[00:45:07] So he'd pick me up and, you know, Hilo is one of those towns where it's adrenaline rush
[00:45:13] all the time.
[00:45:14] It's raining and stuff.
[00:45:15] And we're just having fun cruising and have like Randy Couture come in and teach us how
[00:45:20] to wrestle.
[00:45:21] And he fought Leota Machida at that time.
[00:45:23] So how long are you, how long are you living in Hawaii for?
[00:45:26] For a while.
[00:45:27] Can you put that in some kind of a time perspective?
[00:45:31] I'm still there.
[00:45:32] Like if you go there, they remember me like, look, I'll just be honest with you.
[00:45:37] I went back to Brazil first time in 16 years.
[00:45:39] It was in the middle of COVID.
[00:45:42] Everything was shut down.
[00:45:43] I'm talking about everything.
[00:45:45] No one on the street.
[00:45:46] I brought gorilla hands out there.
[00:45:48] He's from Brazil, but he never been to Rio.
[00:45:49] And he went with me and they just let me and Hanzo out on the street and we actually bumped
[00:45:53] into each other.
[00:45:54] Just me, Hanzo and gorilla hands.
[00:45:56] I have pictures and all of Rio, only people out in the street.
[00:46:00] And they thought I still lived there.
[00:46:02] They think I'm related to Hanzo.
[00:46:03] Like they think I'm one of them.
[00:46:05] That's how it is when I visit here.
[00:46:06] But you look like Hanzo.
[00:46:07] Yeah, or they look like me.
[00:46:08] I don't know.
[00:46:09] We all look like each other.
[00:46:10] Do you still live here?
[00:46:11] You move back.
[00:46:12] So they have no idea I ever left.
[00:46:14] You know, wherever I go, they still think I live there.
[00:46:16] If you go to Hilo, you know, Pete.
[00:46:19] Even here, I'm kind of still, Jeff and I are still here, even though we're not here.
[00:46:23] And so we leave that type of presence because we loved jujitsu.
[00:46:26] Okay.
[00:46:27] So for some unquantifiable amount of time, you're living in Hawaii, you're training
[00:46:33] with, with BJ Penn.
[00:46:35] And this is when BJ Penn is like fighting.
[00:46:37] Yeah.
[00:46:38] Just one, he just beaten Matt Hughes, licked the blood off his face.
[00:46:42] Which also, let me just throw this out there too.
[00:46:44] You were talking about how sometimes the tournaments in Brazil could be very tough for an American
[00:46:48] to win.
[00:46:49] BJ Penn went down there and won.
[00:46:50] But he's not even on the video.
[00:46:51] So if you get the video from that year, that match isn't even on the video.
[00:46:55] You know what I mean?
[00:46:56] So it's like, they kind of like put that, and Hughes to train at Gracie Baja.
[00:47:01] He's from health Gracie, but the same thing happened.
[00:47:04] He got there as a hundred black belts on the mat.
[00:47:06] The first day everyone trained with him.
[00:47:08] The second day no one wanted to even touch him.
[00:47:10] And so then he went over to another team, Carlson Gracie Blackwell, Novo Nyal.
[00:47:16] Pedoneras.
[00:47:17] He goes over there as a purple belt.
[00:47:18] And then he tells me, Pete, I walked up in there, I was nervous.
[00:47:21] He walks up the stairs and Hobbs and Moore was one of their best black belts.
[00:47:25] He's like, I trialed him day one.
[00:47:27] And they were all like, they were surprised.
[00:47:28] He was a purple belt.
[00:47:30] And then they were like talking shit.
[00:47:32] They're like, oh, it was lucky.
[00:47:34] He goes back the next day.
[00:47:35] He's like, I trialed him again.
[00:47:37] And then they gave him a brown belt and they're a competition heavy team.
[00:47:40] And so they needed someone at black belt in the weight class.
[00:47:42] They put him and he won.
[00:47:44] And then I was there at purple belt the next year.
[00:47:48] I think he won 2000.
[00:47:50] So 2001 I was at purple belt.
[00:47:52] They weren't going to let that happen again.
[00:47:53] They're like, no way, dude.
[00:47:56] They're like, you're not coming here and doing that again.
[00:48:00] But people like you, if you're supposed to lose and you win, it's just like, if you're
[00:48:04] a crowd favorite, people like you.
[00:48:06] It doesn't matter what the medal says.
[00:48:08] And I won a lot.
[00:48:10] But then in Hawaii, it hurt my neck.
[00:48:13] How'd you hurt your neck?
[00:48:14] So we went to Sandy's beach, which is like a notorious beach for hurting people.
[00:48:18] And BJ panning them.
[00:48:19] You see, he'd leave me in control a lot.
[00:48:22] When he'd go to Japan and stuff, like he would tell his brothers, Pete's in charge.
[00:48:26] So it left me like, it's hilarious.
[00:48:29] So you know, after some time, I ended up at this beach and I hurt my neck.
[00:48:36] So that took me out of the competition scene.
[00:48:37] There was one.
[00:48:38] What happened to your neck?
[00:48:39] I got slammed on my, I got body surfing.
[00:48:42] I had no idea breakneck beach.
[00:48:45] I had no idea that the most dangerous beach in the world.
[00:48:47] They didn't tell me they're not going to tell you.
[00:48:49] You know what I mean?
[00:48:50] It's like, you're in a, you're in a room full of staff.
[00:48:52] No one tells you.
[00:48:53] So I was like, yeah, you know, just lay on that couch.
[00:48:57] So it's the same.
[00:48:58] That was a jab at me.
[00:48:59] I don't know if you guys knew that was a no side jab at me.
[00:49:01] He thinks all my couches have ringworm and staff on it.
[00:49:03] Fuck you, man.
[00:49:04] He didn't train on me, but MMA people, when you go to their house and you sleep on one
[00:49:09] of their couches, like it's like a joke.
[00:49:11] They're like, yeah, you can stay here as long as you want to stay on that couch.
[00:49:14] It's like a joke.
[00:49:15] Cause you know, like day four, dude's just going to be itching everyone.
[00:49:19] Wow.
[00:49:20] I haven't had ringworm or staff in years.
[00:49:23] No, man, saying it, Jeff doesn't do MMA.
[00:49:24] It's crazy.
[00:49:25] MMA fighters from back in the day.
[00:49:27] I'm not telling, Jeff is clean and he's a, he's a great friend.
[00:49:30] He's a conservative American.
[00:49:32] Well, I've personally witnessed Jeff kick people off the mat for doing whatever kind
[00:49:36] of stuff that, that was a non hygienic.
[00:49:39] Jeff's great.
[00:49:40] So what was the injury to your neck?
[00:49:43] So I get slammed on my neck and I was like, fuck dude, I thought I was paralyzed.
[00:49:50] And I, man, those little guys, I heard some people laugh and I started getting pissed.
[00:49:55] BJ Penn grabbed me out of the ocean cause they think it's funny.
[00:49:57] Like if you, if you get hurt at first kind of, and not being hurt, you know, end up being
[00:50:05] like injury.
[00:50:06] There's an entire series of movies called jackass, which is literally about that right
[00:50:09] there.
[00:50:10] And my friend came up to me and he's like, you know, anytime you want to come back here,
[00:50:12] we'll build a house for you.
[00:50:14] They're just like, they're happy that took it like a man because most people are going
[00:50:17] to be, and I still stayed there for months, like four or five months.
[00:50:20] Did you get surgery?
[00:50:21] Did you get a neck brace?
[00:50:22] What was that?
[00:50:23] Yeah, it was just, it sucks so bad.
[00:50:25] I ended up taking my fight against.
[00:50:26] Did you get numbness in your arms?
[00:50:27] Oh, it was, it was fucked up.
[00:50:28] At first when I got hit, I was completely numb.
[00:50:31] I thought I was paralyzed.
[00:50:32] I was like, I hit it and I was like, whoa.
[00:50:35] And then I usually shake something off.
[00:50:36] I was like, whoa.
[00:50:37] Like, whoa, I'm paralyzed.
[00:50:39] This sucks.
[00:50:41] I'm like, this sucks.
[00:50:43] And I kind of like started accepting it.
[00:50:46] And then I thought about, well, one girl when I was 18 years old, I traveled to Cancun,
[00:50:51] one of my best friends, she died in an ocean undertow and they call me crying.
[00:50:55] Like we lost an ocean.
[00:50:56] I go out there, I find her.
[00:50:57] Just when I was 18, we were on the news and everything in Chicago came back.
[00:51:02] Anyways, first thing I thought of when I thought of her when I got paralyzed, I thought
[00:51:06] of her, I was like, whoa, I was like back in the ocean again, like fuck, I'm paralyzed.
[00:51:11] This sucks.
[00:51:12] And I heard these fuckers laughing.
[00:51:14] And then I felt the pain in calm.
[00:51:15] It was the best pain in my life.
[00:51:17] It was like real pain.
[00:51:19] I was like, and I look at BJ Penn.
[00:51:22] I'm like, I'm hurt, my friend.
[00:51:24] He's like, he looks at me, grabs me up.
[00:51:26] He felt like bad.
[00:51:27] He felt so fucking bad.
[00:51:29] And he grabs me out and his friends didn't know any about it.
[00:51:31] I used to smash them all day.
[00:51:33] It was like purple belts, just random Hawaiians.
[00:51:35] I'd smash the shit out of them.
[00:51:37] They were so happy.
[00:51:39] Random Hawaiians is great.
[00:51:41] I'm just saying, I was there for BJ Penn.
[00:51:46] I wasn't there.
[00:51:47] Like these guys are just like adrenaline dudes.
[00:51:49] Like they're the type of guys that show up when you win and they run when you lose.
[00:51:54] You know what I mean?
[00:51:55] And he knows that I'm talking about BJ Penn, my good friends.
[00:51:57] So it was like those type of friends.
[00:51:59] They weren't like top-notch friends.
[00:52:01] So now you can't, how long before you train?
[00:52:04] I go back to Chicago.
[00:52:07] I'm pissed.
[00:52:09] I was Pete the Greek, Brazilian Hawaiian back in Chicago.
[00:52:12] I was like, fuck.
[00:52:13] Carlson has lost his team.
[00:52:15] He was like, fuck.
[00:52:16] We became best friends.
[00:52:17] We were just like, whoa.
[00:52:20] We're like, we need to gather ourselves.
[00:52:22] Like he's on the phone calling like the shoot box coach, which was the other best team that
[00:52:26] hated top teams.
[00:52:27] Like telling him how to dismantle everyone.
[00:52:29] He's like, yeah, if you're fighting like this guy, be nice to Minotaro.
[00:52:33] Because he wasn't a bad guy.
[00:52:35] But he just telling him how to dismantle these people and call him up.
[00:52:39] And it was just funny.
[00:52:40] Carlson was great.
[00:52:41] And we would study MMA videos every night.
[00:52:45] And not like, like, however, how Jeff and I studied Jitsu, we study MMA and we watched
[00:52:49] Fedor and everything.
[00:52:50] I had Carlson, what do you do here?
[00:52:52] And you stop it and explain it.
[00:52:54] And then I start learning.
[00:52:56] And then we met Stefan Bonner.
[00:52:58] Stefan Bonner walks in as a blue belt.
[00:53:01] And like Carlson, like fuck it.
[00:53:04] Just put this guy to fight, you know?
[00:53:07] Big guy, strong guy, tough guy.
[00:53:10] We taught him to Kimura.
[00:53:12] And UFC calls up.
[00:53:13] We're like, hey, put him in.
[00:53:15] Because Carlson, like that type of person, like people that think are really big, Carlson
[00:53:19] was talking to him like a kid, like Dana Weich, you know?
[00:53:24] Put him in.
[00:53:25] And Stefan changed the whole damn game.
[00:53:28] Well, of course, VTOR did before, but UFC got boring until Ultimate Fighter came out.
[00:53:34] And then that's why Dana Weich and all of them, they love me.
[00:53:37] And when Dana Weich comes to Chicago, he takes Gibson's.
[00:53:41] Every time he shows up, he gets a wine from my friend from Pete to Greek, like automatic.
[00:53:45] Like he's had him like 50 times.
[00:53:48] So we go in there, Stefan, like blue belt, knows one move.
[00:53:52] It feels like the fight of whatever, the sentry against Forrest Griffin, because when you
[00:53:58] fight against Carlson guys, you have Carlson staring at you.
[00:54:01] So he's like, he's not a mean guy, but he's a spiritual guy.
[00:54:05] So it's like, you're just like, fuck, I'm fucked.
[00:54:09] You're fighting that guy.
[00:54:10] You'll find the whole history.
[00:54:12] It's everything.
[00:54:13] And Stefan, he knew enough.
[00:54:14] He did the Golden Globes boxing, knew the Kimura, and he was strong.
[00:54:19] If you grab that damn Kimura, your arms getting ripped off.
[00:54:24] And he did that.
[00:54:25] He changed the whole game.
[00:54:27] The UFC went from rags of riches.
[00:54:28] They were dying.
[00:54:30] Now everyone watching it again.
[00:54:32] UFC's huge.
[00:54:34] People are buying paper views.
[00:54:37] And that's what I did when I was in Chicago.
[00:54:38] And Miguel Torres came too.
[00:54:41] We helped him out.
[00:54:43] And then he won the WEC.
[00:54:47] And that's when Dominic Cruz took over his weight class.
[00:54:50] So it's all related.
[00:54:51] And then I became from the Dominic Cruz's.
[00:54:53] It's all like, those are the smaller guys.
[00:54:56] Those are the smart guys.
[00:54:57] When did you open your academy?
[00:55:00] So I had surgery.
[00:55:01] Mark Coleman, I'm over there at Cobra Kai.
[00:55:04] Because for the Ultimate Fighter, I was like their bodyguard.
[00:55:06] It was funny.
[00:55:07] I'm not a big guy, but they like me.
[00:55:08] So Stefan invites me.
[00:55:10] And so all the guys, Chris Lieben, they're all there.
[00:55:13] And I'm in the limo with them.
[00:55:15] And it was for the Ultimate Fighter Caesar 1.
[00:55:18] And it was like for the grand finale.
[00:55:21] So we're all at layman's Cobra Kai.
[00:55:23] And what's his name tells me?
[00:55:25] What's that big wrestler?
[00:55:26] Mark Coleman.
[00:55:26] He's like, hey, Pete DeGreer.
[00:55:28] I just had back surgery at Dr. Joe.
[00:55:30] It's a guy in Pittsburgh.
[00:55:31] And I show up there and the guy fixes my neck.
[00:55:34] He does like to dissect me.
[00:55:36] He's like a sniper.
[00:55:37] He'll fix you.
[00:55:38] So I go there.
[00:55:40] And I'm like, yeah, I'm here for Mark Coleman.
[00:55:41] He fixed my neck.
[00:55:43] But I didn't want to compete again.
[00:55:48] I said, shoot.
[00:55:49] I'm like one injury from being away from homeless.
[00:55:52] I better open a gym.
[00:55:54] It was like I'm looking for shelter.
[00:55:56] Like, where do I go?
[00:55:57] Who can I trust?
[00:55:58] I'm back in Chicago.
[00:56:00] Like I was even in Brazil.
[00:56:02] Shoot, Rio de Janeiro, Hawaii.
[00:56:04] Now I'm back in Chicago with a broken neck.
[00:56:07] People are laughing at me.
[00:56:09] Like I went and worked in the ghetto in Chicago.
[00:56:12] Doing what?
[00:56:13] So my friends, they're getting all happy.
[00:56:15] Like, we knew you'd end up getting hurt.
[00:56:18] I'm like, you fucking assholes.
[00:56:21] And you got hurt from the body surface.
[00:56:22] You know what I mean?
[00:56:23] But it doesn't matter that people see you.
[00:56:25] Like you got hurt from that jujitsu.
[00:56:27] I'm like, oh, OK.
[00:56:29] I'm like, yeah, I'm here to work a job.
[00:56:31] And so I got my real estate license.
[00:56:33] And I was working for my friends doing section eight housing.
[00:56:36] So I'd pick up people from the projects.
[00:56:38] They would turn on the products and bring them to apartments.
[00:56:41] And I was like, fuck, dude.
[00:56:43] I don't want to do this.
[00:56:46] And then it was in bed.
[00:56:49] But I'm a jujitsu guy.
[00:56:51] Like I'm having to like really, like I'm like,
[00:56:53] I don't want to really have to use jujitsu.
[00:56:55] I want to like, I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:56:57] So I opened up this little gym.
[00:56:59] Like a real little one.
[00:57:00] Glover came.
[00:57:01] He was in a sketchy neighborhood.
[00:57:03] I remember Glover's first day.
[00:57:04] Like the guy comes in.
[00:57:06] Glover's on the door waiting for him.
[00:57:07] He's like, y'all do tap out?
[00:57:08] Because I had a tap outside.
[00:57:10] Y'all do tap out?
[00:57:11] Remember that Glover?
[00:57:12] Wait, that's what Glover said when he walked in?
[00:57:13] The guy that seemed Glover outside the thing.
[00:57:15] Remember the first day outside my gym?
[00:57:16] He remember that.
[00:57:17] Because I had a big tap out sign.
[00:57:18] So people in Chicago thought that I did.
[00:57:21] They thought jujitsu is called tap out.
[00:57:23] It's crazy.
[00:57:24] So then I opened up this little gym.
[00:57:27] Everyone's telling me, you know, you're going to get shot.
[00:57:31] I'm like, yeah, right, dude.
[00:57:33] I open up the gym and bam, I get my best friends, best
[00:57:37] students right from there.
[00:57:38] They're so cool.
[00:57:39] Because right on North Avenue and Western,
[00:57:40] the two biggest streets in Chicago.
[00:57:42] So pretty much everyone can get there from the South side
[00:57:46] and North side, from downtown, from everywhere.
[00:57:49] There's a little gym like 600 square feet.
[00:57:51] And man, I mean, my best friends from there,
[00:57:54] they knew I was hurt.
[00:57:55] I told them straight up, I'm like, look, my neck is hurt.
[00:57:59] I'm like, you guys just got to get good.
[00:58:01] I'm going to tell you what to do.
[00:58:02] I'm not going to fight you.
[00:58:03] Just learn how to listen.
[00:58:05] And man, we got a lot of students in there.
[00:58:07] It was crazy.
[00:58:08] Like cars parked outside.
[00:58:10] And next thing you know, all my friends
[00:58:11] are open up gyms next to me.
[00:58:13] I'm like, oh, thanks.
[00:58:14] You guys are great friends.
[00:58:16] Like you see businesses going great.
[00:58:18] And shoot, gym got big.
[00:58:24] Kid students, I open up a giant gym.
[00:58:27] And things are going great.
[00:58:31] Glover then came to my giant gym.
[00:58:32] I always have Glover out for, he's always about, I'm like,
[00:58:35] guys, we're having a seminar.
[00:58:36] Like what did you guys meet for the first time?
[00:58:38] Like with Scotty.
[00:58:39] That was through Scotty.
[00:58:40] Everything Scotty.
[00:58:41] Everything Scotty.
[00:58:42] I would have never been.
[00:58:45] Scotty taught me how to be a California boy.
[00:58:47] I was just like Chicago, like cold winter,
[00:58:49] that and anything.
[00:58:50] I'm like, yeah, I just need to smash and win and fight.
[00:58:53] And then Scotty shows you like surfing.
[00:58:56] He shows you everything.
[00:58:58] How to roll a joint, stuff like that.
[00:59:00] Scotty had one of those scooters, like a quick scooter
[00:59:04] in Brazil.
[00:59:05] And we would just go like, you're going like 40 miles now
[00:59:07] on a scooter, he had the first digital camera.
[00:59:10] Scotty's like from the future.
[00:59:12] Back then.
[00:59:13] Now I don't know, because now he's with the hospital stuff.
[00:59:15] I haven't spent too much time with him.
[00:59:16] But back then he was from the future.
[00:59:18] He'd teach us all this stuff.
[00:59:20] And man, Hawaii, Brazil, everywhere.
[00:59:23] I go back to Chicago.
[00:59:25] It's kind of like, it's like a community service.
[00:59:28] Like I'm really helping out people.
[00:59:31] Chicago is like a barter system.
[00:59:33] It's like a third world country.
[00:59:34] People don't want to pay you that much.
[00:59:36] They'd rather just barter you.
[00:59:37] And it works out good because everyone there has
[00:59:40] like connections to this and that.
[00:59:42] And this guy owns that place.
[00:59:44] He owns a restaurant.
[00:59:45] You know, if you try and charge him,
[00:59:47] you end up getting less.
[00:59:48] So you're like, hey, everyone trains for free.
[00:59:50] So my gym people pretty much pay.
[00:59:53] It's like, here, you don't charge people that much, Jaco.
[00:59:56] No, we try and keep it.
[00:59:57] We try and keep it so people can come in.
[00:59:59] And I don't have overhead like you.
[01:00:01] Yeah, I've overhead much lower.
[01:00:03] And so it's like, dude, I know if you have money,
[01:00:06] I know if, you know, like pay what you think you should.
[01:00:08] Like, you know, if there's food in the kitchen,
[01:00:10] eat what you deserve.
[01:00:12] And my guys understand that.
[01:00:14] And I could make a lot more money being there,
[01:00:16] but I wouldn't be in Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:00:18] Like I'm doing Jiu-Jitsu as service with the Glover,
[01:00:21] with the Ritolos, with BJ Penn, all these people.
[01:00:25] I'm doing a higher service.
[01:00:27] I could be at home teaching white belts.
[01:00:30] And they might quit in a few months.
[01:00:32] They might win a tournament.
[01:00:33] And I can make a lot more money for sure, 100%.
[01:00:37] But if I'm looking at it from service,
[01:00:40] like we help the whole world.
[01:00:43] We're all over the place.
[01:00:44] The weed is better in California.
[01:00:47] And cheaper.
[01:00:50] And legal, right?
[01:00:50] Is it legal in Chicago?
[01:00:51] That's a big part of it, yeah.
[01:00:53] Chicago, you go to the store, it's like 40% Texas, you know?
[01:00:57] And yeah, I love Chicago.
[01:01:00] I love that place, but with my broken neck,
[01:01:03] see I got hit by, okay, so I opened up the giant gym.
[01:01:06] Bam, Glover comes over, like who are we doing a seminar with?
[01:01:09] Jeff Glover, I'm like, yeah, again,
[01:01:11] every seminar is with Glover at my school.
[01:01:14] Like, it's just the way it is.
[01:01:17] And so we had a couple other ones,
[01:01:19] but most of them like eight out of 10 seminars are with Jeff.
[01:01:22] And-
[01:01:23] The sickest I ever got was one of the seminars
[01:01:27] I did at your school.
[01:01:28] You took me to-
[01:01:30] The Burger King.
[01:01:30] You took me to Burger King twice on the same day.
[01:01:33] That's not how it was.
[01:01:34] Yeah, it was coming out of both ends.
[01:01:36] And I was, you know, Pete's like,
[01:01:39] you all right in there Glover?
[01:01:40] I was like, I hate you, man.
[01:01:42] I'm down in this basement, you know?
[01:01:44] Like I got a great home back in San Diego waiting for me.
[01:01:47] And like this place was here.
[01:01:48] And I'm like in Pete's basement,
[01:01:50] vomiting, I can just taste the like chicken.
[01:01:52] Remember chicken fries?
[01:01:53] It's chicken fries.
[01:01:54] Oh, damn, I ate that shit.
[01:01:56] This is gross.
[01:01:57] Oh, it was bad, yeah.
[01:01:57] That's when, whenever Pete talks about the shit,
[01:01:59] that's all I ever think about.
[01:02:01] So, Jeff, that was the closest I ever felt to death, dude.
[01:02:04] Let me tell you what happened.
[01:02:05] I said, Jeff comes over, I'm feeling great.
[01:02:08] And drunk drivers hit me and break my neck again and my back.
[01:02:13] And then I was just like,
[01:02:15] I can't live here anymore.
[01:02:16] It's too cold.
[01:02:17] And then I went and lived with Glover.
[01:02:19] Glover, would you used to call him?
[01:02:20] You were my therapist.
[01:02:22] Did I? I don't remember that.
[01:02:24] Yeah, you're my physical therapist.
[01:02:26] So then I met you guys.
[01:02:27] So, Jeff, when you started,
[01:02:32] when you started like competing for real,
[01:02:34] like now you're like, no,
[01:02:37] when you started doing the worlds
[01:02:39] and it's like 2007, 2008,
[01:02:42] what's your life like at this point?
[01:02:44] What's your training schedule looking like?
[01:02:46] It's just Jiu Jitsu, Jiu Jitsu, Jiu Jitsu, right?
[01:02:49] I mean, the Jiu Jitsu was the only thing
[01:02:51] that was not chaotic.
[01:02:54] Well, what's chaotic?
[01:02:56] I mean, just life, social life, family life, finances.
[01:03:01] Where do you live?
[01:03:02] Where are you living during this time?
[01:03:03] I mean, like, I live,
[01:03:05] Joe Stevenson let me live in his place for like two months.
[01:03:08] Big daddy.
[01:03:09] I mean, I was living all over.
[01:03:10] I was living in all these places.
[01:03:12] And your whole existence is just a trained Jiu Jitsu.
[01:03:17] Yeah, pretty much.
[01:03:18] Are you still with Franjia this whole time?
[01:03:22] I went between, I started,
[01:03:24] this is where I started realizing
[01:03:25] that like this one place thing wasn't for me.
[01:03:28] That just being with Franjia wasn't gonna cut it.
[01:03:30] And Mark Lehman was already a big influence to me,
[01:03:35] making those videos.
[01:03:36] Mark Lehman was the first YouTube, you know?
[01:03:39] And,
[01:03:40] Where's Mark Lehman from right now?
[01:03:42] He went back home to Michigan.
[01:03:44] Does he have a school out there?
[01:03:45] Yeah, yeah, he's all low-key though.
[01:03:47] And no Instagram, nothing.
[01:03:49] He was a beast.
[01:03:50] But he was very influential.
[01:03:52] And it's cool because I get to say
[01:03:53] I trained with Mark and Dean.
[01:03:55] Because Mark and Dean were the two big.
[01:03:57] It was like who were the best Americans at the time?
[01:03:59] It was always Mark Lehman and Dean Lister.
[01:04:01] And they fought.
[01:04:02] And I got to be,
[01:04:03] I've spent so much time with both those guys.
[01:04:05] And yeah, I started doing the Mark thing.
[01:04:08] And I told Franjia, Mark offered me a job in Las Vegas,
[01:04:10] a full-time teaching job.
[01:04:12] It was my first full-time teaching job.
[01:04:13] And Franjia's school, it was like,
[01:04:16] Franjia, can you match what Mark's offering me?
[01:04:18] And he was like, sorry, boy, I can't.
[01:04:20] If you wanna keep assisting me for free,
[01:04:22] that's cool, and I was like, well, I think I'm a man.
[01:04:24] So I went to Mark Lehman and when Franjia gave him
[01:04:27] my black belt, he tied it around my waist.
[01:04:30] And I had already told him, I was making the move.
[01:04:33] And in my ear, he was like,
[01:04:35] boy, go show those guys how we do the Paragon Jiu-Jitsu
[01:04:38] in the Las Vegas.
[01:04:39] I'm proud of you.
[01:04:40] You know what I'm saying?
[01:04:41] He was like, you welcome back any time, boy.
[01:04:43] You know what I'm saying?
[01:04:44] So I started going between those two places.
[01:04:48] And actually, that's when I started hanging out
[01:04:50] with Rudy.
[01:04:51] That's when I met Rudy at tournaments.
[01:04:52] And Rudy would, I would come visit Rudy.
[01:04:55] And that's how I started making friends with all you guys.
[01:04:57] Right on.
[01:04:58] You know?
[01:04:59] And it was like, yeah.
[01:05:02] How many hours a day are you training at this time period?
[01:05:06] I mean, I would train in every class I would teach
[01:05:11] and I would take Mark's classes, yeah.
[01:05:13] So it was still, it was still, until recently,
[01:05:16] it was like, you know, four times a day every day.
[01:05:18] And eight to 10 hours on the mat.
[01:05:22] We take naps though.
[01:05:24] How many hours a day are the rotolos on the mat right now?
[01:05:27] Like we gotta take naps once in a while.
[01:05:28] Frequent cat naps, yeah.
[01:05:30] And then they gotta be in nature.
[01:05:31] I think nowadays is different training.
[01:05:33] Now we do more nature training.
[01:05:35] Cause just being with-
[01:05:36] I'm doing recovery.
[01:05:37] I'm all about recovery now.
[01:05:38] Yeah. It's good to be outside a lot.
[01:05:40] When you were-
[01:05:41] With surfing, like, you know what I mean?
[01:05:42] They taught me how to surf.
[01:05:43] They taught me how to surf.
[01:05:44] They got into surfing.
[01:05:45] The total was taught me how to surf the other day.
[01:05:47] Nice.
[01:05:48] I surf with them.
[01:05:48] They like, they surf a lot.
[01:05:52] When you were training, and like, let's say you were
[01:05:54] getting ready for ADCC or you're getting ready for,
[01:05:58] you know, the worlds.
[01:06:01] How much drilling you doing?
[01:06:03] Nothing changed.
[01:06:04] All's I, I did everything the same.
[01:06:06] I think there was one tournament that I actually had
[01:06:09] like a professional coach.
[01:06:11] But it was just-
[01:06:13] What, like a Jiu-Jitsu coach?
[01:06:14] No, like a fitness nutrition.
[01:06:16] A guy named Chris Eklund in 2011.
[01:06:20] And he had me doing all kinds of shit.
[01:06:22] And how'd you feel?
[01:06:23] I mean, I, that was the best year in my competitive life.
[01:06:26] Yeah.
[01:06:27] So he, you stepped it up and then that made you better.
[01:06:32] He would, he would like frown at me if I was baked.
[01:06:38] You know, he'd be like, yeah.
[01:06:40] I'd be like, for bread.
[01:06:41] You're making me feel bad for all the times
[01:06:42] that I've smiled at you and you were baked.
[01:06:44] Yeah.
[01:06:45] Like, you know, he would be like, what did you eat today?
[01:06:47] And like stuff like that.
[01:06:49] And make sure I did like real like weightlifting stuff.
[01:06:52] And that year, that was 2011.
[01:06:54] And I had the best results that year.
[01:06:55] Like hands down.
[01:06:58] Did-
[01:06:59] But other than that, I never trained hard.
[01:07:00] I know, I mean, I trained hard, but I didn't work out.
[01:07:03] There was no weights.
[01:07:04] There was no, what do you call it?
[01:07:06] Stadiums.
[01:07:07] There was no stairs.
[01:07:09] There's no elastic bands.
[01:07:11] There was no box jumps.
[01:07:12] Yeah.
[01:07:13] But-
[01:07:14] And there was no bell.
[01:07:15] Those Taco Bell video games.
[01:07:16] And just dope ass jujitsu.
[01:07:18] Yeah, that's the thing.
[01:07:19] And just the best technique, the most like dork about it.
[01:07:23] I would go down the rabbit hole of what's next, what's next.
[01:07:27] Move after that.
[01:07:28] 20, 30 move combinations before the dude
[01:07:30] will just give up and I would tap him.
[01:07:32] Glover trains in his sleep.
[01:07:33] I think that's where the magic happens.
[01:07:36] Dean does that too.
[01:07:37] Like, you know, when he would fight
[01:07:38] and we'd all be like, we were all broken everything.
[01:07:40] And so we'd all stay in like one hotel room.
[01:07:42] And like I'd sleep on the floor, but you'd like wake up
[01:07:46] and Dean would be there like asleep,
[01:07:48] but he would be trying.
[01:07:49] He'd be like, not just his legs would be in a triangle
[01:07:53] and like triangle air.
[01:07:56] And then you'd see him like roll over.
[01:07:57] But when he'd roll over, he would like adjust his feet
[01:08:01] and get like a body lock.
[01:08:02] Like shadow wrestling.
[01:08:04] I'm not kidding.
[01:08:05] Like that's where he would sleep.
[01:08:06] Like he would sleep.
[01:08:07] He'd be doing jujitsu when he was sleeping.
[01:08:08] Or like he'd be asleep and his hands
[01:08:10] would be like on a rear naked.
[01:08:11] Like he'd be asleep like one hand under his head,
[01:08:14] but his hands are in a rear naked choke.
[01:08:16] So he's just like dreaming of jujitsu and sleeping that way.
[01:08:20] I met Dean in Brazil when I was out there.
[01:08:24] He'd hang out with my dad and I.
[01:08:25] My dad came and my dad's a big strong guy too.
[01:08:28] Like Dean, like I'm a runt compared to my dad.
[01:08:31] And he just loved me hanging out with Dean.
[01:08:33] He's like, ha ha ha.
[01:08:34] Ha ha ha.
[01:08:36] Your friend is a cool guy.
[01:08:38] Strong guy, Pete.
[01:08:39] You know, he's like looking at me like,
[01:08:40] why can't I be like Dean?
[01:08:42] You know, I'm just like, whoa.
[01:08:43] So like they'd always hang out.
[01:08:45] It was like for like three weeks.
[01:08:47] And Dean showed up to Scotty's house.
[01:08:50] And that's where I met him.
[01:08:51] Because Scotty a little man.
[01:08:52] I lived at Scotty's house on the weekend.
[01:08:54] During the week I lived mostly at Oswaldo Alves,
[01:08:57] which is a little gym where Andre Galvão lived in
[01:09:00] and Jacaré.
[01:09:02] We all lived in there together.
[01:09:03] Andre was a blue belt.
[01:09:07] And at that time, that place,
[01:09:09] they would lock the door on Fridays.
[01:09:11] So if they locked us in, we'd have to stay inside.
[01:09:14] There was no way out.
[01:09:16] It would be like the door to victory locks
[01:09:18] on Friday until Monday.
[01:09:21] So me and Glory, I figure shit out on the weekend
[01:09:23] if we're living in the little,
[01:09:24] it was a little gym, a little bit bigger in here.
[01:09:26] So I would leave and go to Scotty's house in Baja.
[01:09:29] It's like 40 minutes away.
[01:09:30] It was like vacation.
[01:09:31] Scotty had his house set up like a hostel.
[01:09:33] So all these people would come stay.
[01:09:34] They have the mats.
[01:09:35] I think we had the original.
[01:09:36] He had Dean brought the guys from, I think,
[01:09:39] their original friends' years.
[01:09:42] And he brought them and Dean wasn't allowed to train.
[01:09:45] They wouldn't let him train anywhere
[01:09:46] because he went like the year before
[01:09:48] and leg locked everyone.
[01:09:49] So he was banned from every gym
[01:09:51] and he had ADCC coming up.
[01:09:53] And I was kind of in a similar situation.
[01:09:56] So we just, Scotty had a little thing
[01:09:59] right in the living room
[01:10:01] and Dean just trained with me.
[01:10:04] And he went the first day and lost.
[01:10:07] It was Tony D'Souza was also staying over there.
[01:10:09] Tony got disqualified for making the guy too bloody.
[01:10:12] They disqualified him for being too mean to the opponent.
[01:10:15] No one even seen that match.
[01:10:17] But Dean, Dean was kind of bummed out.
[01:10:19] We went and hung out and we hung out with some chicks
[01:10:22] and had fun that night.
[01:10:23] And he's like, I'm gonna do the absolutes.
[01:10:26] And no expectation.
[01:10:27] The winning goes there and just crushes it.
[01:10:30] And then I was like, whoa dude, like this is so cool.
[01:10:33] Like, that's when, yeah, that's when I met Dean.
[01:10:37] He just became ADCC champ.
[01:10:39] He was like, he just turned in like national superstar,
[01:10:41] Brazil, like after that fight.
[01:10:43] And he leg locked everyone.
[01:10:45] And then I kind of felt happy about that.
[01:10:47] I was reading, I couldn't go down.
[01:10:49] I was, I couldn't go down for whatever reason to,
[01:10:53] cause normally I would corner him, right?
[01:10:54] And I couldn't go down.
[01:10:56] And so I'm reading the updates on the interwebs.
[01:11:01] In the guard forums?
[01:11:02] No, it wasn't on in the guard.
[01:11:03] It was on submission grappling.
[01:11:05] I think submission grappling.com.
[01:11:07] And they're putting, but they're,
[01:11:09] it's a translation from Portuguese.
[01:11:13] But it's like some kind of a computer translation
[01:11:16] that someone's translating it and posting it.
[01:11:18] And I remember paid a Pono that in,
[01:11:20] in Portuguese that translates to cloth foot.
[01:11:23] And so it's saying like the American,
[01:11:27] no, cloth foot has the American.
[01:11:30] The American in an arm strangle.
[01:11:34] Then it says, this American has tubes to his lung.
[01:11:38] The cloth foot cannot make him tap.
[01:11:40] It was, and I'm like, oh dude, he's waiting.
[01:11:42] And then it's like, the American got his back.
[01:11:44] I was like, ah, you know, I'm like reading this.
[01:11:46] I was in my car, I was in my freaking minivan.
[01:11:49] Yeah, I was like in my minivan.
[01:11:50] Like, ah, yeah, you know, totally fired up
[01:11:53] that he's doing this and ends up with the.
[01:11:56] Dean's like a national hero anywhere I go.
[01:11:58] Like if we go to Brazil, he's like,
[01:12:00] we hung out in Chicago.
[01:12:02] He was great.
[01:12:03] I just feel like Dean's in there in the bar.
[01:12:05] He's like, how does he arm his friend?
[01:12:09] He's a great person.
[01:12:10] Shoot, he, you guys really helped out Glover and I,
[01:12:13] cause my dad, like I said, he's like a strong alpha dude,
[01:12:16] but I didn't really grow up with him that much.
[01:12:18] I worked with him.
[01:12:20] And I think Glover and the Saint,
[01:12:21] we have strong moms and stuff,
[01:12:23] but like meeting you and seeing how he was doing
[01:12:25] really helps us like, right Glover,
[01:12:28] we got pretty serious.
[01:12:29] Mostly Echo's arms kind of.
[01:12:31] We got serious like,
[01:12:32] It changed my life.
[01:12:33] And we definitely tried to better our lives
[01:12:35] from meeting you.
[01:12:36] Like that's the truth.
[01:12:38] Glover, right?
[01:12:39] I'm joking, of course, you know that.
[01:12:40] You guys know that.
[01:12:41] Yeah.
[01:12:42] Jeff, when you, when you,
[01:12:44] you always give Dean some, some credit
[01:12:47] or a lot of credit actually, when I watched like interviews,
[01:12:49] you'd be talking about Dean and you'll be talking about
[01:12:50] like how he helped out your leg lock game.
[01:12:54] What did that happen when you were teaching here?
[01:12:56] You were already leg locking and heel hooking people, right?
[01:12:58] Yeah, but I mean, Dean motivated all of us.
[01:13:02] And even those who didn't train with him,
[01:13:03] we were all like,
[01:13:05] What is this guy doing?
[01:13:06] Dean, leg locks are bullshit.
[01:13:07] Yeah, but Dean, you know.
[01:13:11] Best comeback ever.
[01:13:12] Yeah, but Dean.
[01:13:13] You know what I'm saying?
[01:13:13] And Franjia, that was the one,
[01:13:15] that was when Franjia was like,
[01:13:17] I heard him admit like leg locks worked.
[01:13:20] He was like, look, there's this guy, Jeffy.
[01:13:22] I was like, why is this American guy?
[01:13:25] He's Tapsolo.
[01:13:26] I was like, what?
[01:13:27] He taps all his leg lock, Jeffy.
[01:13:28] You know, he was like,
[01:13:31] I'm sorry, I was like, sad day dog.
[01:13:35] Fuck.
[01:13:36] But you know, it's like,
[01:13:38] that Dean made it okay for us.
[01:13:41] You know, that when an OG would be like,
[01:13:42] no, no, no, no, no, be like, shut up, you grumpy old OG.
[01:13:45] This guy's making them, they're legit.
[01:13:47] So.
[01:13:48] It is true.
[01:13:50] Yeah, that's a, what about the game?
[01:13:53] Like I'll read about your game.
[01:13:54] Like you'll do donkey guard,
[01:13:56] which is for anyone that doesn't do jiu-jitsu,
[01:13:58] it's gonna be kind of hard to explain,
[01:13:59] but just imagine someone that you're gonna fight.
[01:14:04] And what they do is they turn around,
[01:14:05] get on their hands and knees and like jump,
[01:14:09] go attack you with their ass, basically,
[01:14:11] is what it looks like if someone doesn't know.
[01:14:14] That's freaking mayhem, dude.
[01:14:15] Yeah.
[01:14:16] Well, it's based off defense.
[01:14:19] It's based off self-defense.
[01:14:21] I'm a master of people grabbing me.
[01:14:23] So you wrap them to grab me.
[01:14:24] You know what I'm saying?
[01:14:25] I encourage you to grab me in positions
[01:14:27] that they think is good.
[01:14:30] And my self-defense kicks in,
[01:14:32] and it just does what it does.
[01:14:34] And I have a heel hook, you know?
[01:14:36] It's a combination of like the flying leg scissors technique,
[01:14:39] you know, that, and just kind of doing things backwards.
[01:14:46] The level of confidence that you have,
[01:14:48] I might be unmatched.
[01:14:50] I don't know if anyone wants to echo.
[01:14:52] I would agree.
[01:14:53] Unmatched level of confidence?
[01:14:54] Unmatched.
[01:14:55] Unmatched level of confidence.
[01:14:55] Unmatched.
[01:14:56] Like no one's even close.
[01:14:57] I think it's an unmatched level of confidence
[01:14:59] to see you compete and see you just offer positions
[01:15:04] to your opponent that seem insane.
[01:15:08] I would rather look stupid than look scared.
[01:15:14] I don't, I also don't think that there's been a grappler
[01:15:19] that is more, I hate to say this word,
[01:15:23] but like more entertaining to watch.
[01:15:25] Like watch it, like I go watch you,
[01:15:28] I go watch you all day, roll Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:15:30] I go watch you all day.
[01:15:32] Like I told you, I have like videos of you and my son,
[01:15:34] like, like, you know, one, one year,
[01:15:37] one like the next year, like eight minute videos.
[01:15:39] You guys are just rolling.
[01:15:41] And I just, I'll just watch them.
[01:15:44] Cause it's just, even though you're going against a kid,
[01:15:47] I'm like, God, what is he doing?
[01:15:48] I'm like, look at what he's doing right there.
[01:15:50] But then when you watch you compete the same thing,
[01:15:52] it's freaking amazing to watch.
[01:15:55] Yeah, thank you.
[01:15:56] Yeah.
[01:15:57] I've worked very hard to be as good at Jiu-Jitsu as I am.
[01:16:00] That level of confidence though, I'm kind of unmatched.
[01:16:04] I mean, even like you've been teaching a series this week,
[01:16:06] it's like stuff I've never even, well, it's weird
[01:16:09] cause you started teaching this series
[01:16:13] and you know, I watched you here for five years.
[01:16:16] I watched you give your back to people.
[01:16:18] I watched you like do these weird positions.
[01:16:19] I'm like, wow, man, that's just like a Jeff Glover thing.
[01:16:22] And then you were explaining it the other day.
[01:16:24] I was like, oh, this is not just a Jeff Glover thing.
[01:16:27] It's just that Jeff Glover is doing something
[01:16:29] that I didn't understand.
[01:16:31] Yeah.
[01:16:32] Which is-
[01:16:33] I trust my Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:16:35] Don't you trust your Jiu-Jitsu?
[01:16:36] Sometimes not as much as you do bro, at all.
[01:16:38] I trust in it dude.
[01:16:39] My coach used to tell me believe and I believe dude.
[01:16:42] Yeah.
[01:16:43] I believe.
[01:16:44] Jeff doesn't reference other people when he does things.
[01:16:46] He'll just think of it and do it way cooler.
[01:16:48] No, that's like, that's why I say dude,
[01:16:50] I feel like an idiot.
[01:16:51] Like you're like, oh, don't you trust your Jiu-Jitsu?
[01:16:53] I'm like, well not as much as you do bro, apparently.
[01:16:56] Cause you're just in there just not caring what happens
[01:16:58] and still, you know.
[01:17:00] Jeff moves well.
[01:17:01] I'm the worst actually.
[01:17:02] I think I'm the worst.
[01:17:04] People ask me about you.
[01:17:05] Every, everywhere I go do my seminars.
[01:17:07] They're like, what's it like to roll with Jocco?
[01:17:09] And I was telling them like you were always so nice to me.
[01:17:11] You and Dean and Echo, you guys are always, you know,
[01:17:13] so gentle with me.
[01:17:15] I'm so little and like all hard.
[01:17:16] And you guys are like, hi little Jeff.
[01:17:18] And one time you actually like turned it on
[01:17:21] and put me in a Kimura, you know.
[01:17:23] And people love when I tell them that.
[01:17:25] Like there's no point to that
[01:17:26] besides people being like, whoa, you know Jocco?
[01:17:29] Like, yeah, he's really good.
[01:17:31] No, that's, well I was, you know, would feel like
[01:17:35] I wanted to learn how to kind of roll that way
[01:17:39] where you learn more, you know.
[01:17:41] You guys are all nice to me.
[01:17:42] I'm not a good roller and learner.
[01:17:45] You're, that's what you do.
[01:17:46] And I tried to like get that from you
[01:17:48] to be a good roller and learner.
[01:17:51] Which is, it's ridiculous.
[01:17:52] Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:53] It's more fun that way.
[01:17:55] No, I can see that's something that
[01:17:57] lasts longer.
[01:17:58] To this day for sure.
[01:17:59] Yeah, I mean, I got like neck surgery.
[01:18:01] Why'd I get neck surgery?
[01:18:01] If we can Dean Lister trying to choke me
[01:18:03] and I'm not tapping.
[01:18:04] Yeah, I was gonna say Dean wasn't as nice to me
[01:18:06] as you guys were.
[01:18:08] Dean would hold me in like growl in my ear and shit.
[01:18:12] Look at Glover, he can't get up.
[01:18:13] Look at, by the way, everybody.
[01:18:15] Everybody, come here, look at.
[01:18:17] By the way, you ever seen a man get out of this?
[01:18:19] Watch, Glover, try to get out.
[01:18:21] Watch, look, he can't.
[01:18:23] Look how weak he is.
[01:18:24] He can't get out.
[01:18:24] That's like being nice compared to what Dean has done.
[01:18:28] I've seen you, I know.
[01:18:30] I saw that shit.
[01:18:31] It's like a test in humiliation, right?
[01:18:34] Yeah, I gained a lot of respect for you.
[01:18:36] How can I do Jiu-Jitsu?
[01:18:38] I have 225 pounds, I lift weights every day.
[01:18:42] Freaking training Jiu-Jitsu every day.
[01:18:44] And I'm a grown man.
[01:18:48] And Dean would put me in positions
[01:18:50] where I could not move or he could not look,
[01:18:54] could not move my body in any way.
[01:18:56] How's that happening?
[01:18:57] No, I remember you'd say that.
[01:18:58] And he's like holding me with one.
[01:19:00] And he doesn't lift weights.
[01:19:01] No.
[01:19:02] You're like, Dean never lifts weights.
[01:19:03] And he would say stuff like that.
[01:19:04] He'd be like, you need more CrossFit, John Coran.
[01:19:07] Where's your CrossFit?
[01:19:08] I thought you could squat a lot.
[01:19:10] What are you doing?
[01:19:11] How's that squat working out right now?
[01:19:13] That's perfect.
[01:19:14] That's so good.
[01:19:15] We all say that.
[01:19:16] Yeah, he did that shit to me too.
[01:19:17] It's good, but it's not good.
[01:19:18] But so speaking of like the Dean Lister Jocko thing,
[01:19:23] because I will say thankfully,
[01:19:25] I got to be Dean Lister's guy.
[01:19:28] In those years when he was becoming a champion,
[01:19:31] I was the guy, I would train with him every day.
[01:19:34] We train two hours, three hours, four hours a day.
[01:19:36] You need to have someone like that in your life.
[01:19:39] You had Bill the grill.
[01:19:41] Yeah, that's right.
[01:19:42] That's your guy.
[01:19:43] So anybody that's doing Jiu-Jitsu,
[01:19:45] you need to find that guy.
[01:19:47] And the only, we talk about the play for rolling,
[01:19:49] and look, I just talked about Dean.
[01:19:52] Like humiliate, and believe me, he'd humiliate me.
[01:19:54] Any day I'd get a position on him,
[01:19:57] bro, I would go twice as hard humiliating him
[01:20:01] and having fun with it.
[01:20:02] Payback's a bitch though.
[01:20:04] But for Jiu-Jitsu, you got to find somebody,
[01:20:07] or like, it's probably going to be one person.
[01:20:09] It's hard to even find more than one person like this.
[01:20:12] But someone that's going to be your like true brother,
[01:20:18] teammate that you're going to roll with,
[01:20:19] you're going to learn with, you're going to work on stuff,
[01:20:21] you're going to stay after, you're going to drill stuff,
[01:20:22] you're going to get tapped out by each other,
[01:20:24] you don't care.
[01:20:25] It's just like that.
[01:20:26] You had Bill the grill.
[01:20:27] How'd he come into the scene?
[01:20:29] Well, he just, he did, you know?
[01:20:31] He just started showing up.
[01:20:32] How far behind he?
[01:20:34] He's five years younger.
[01:20:35] He was 13.
[01:20:36] He was 13 when he started,
[01:20:37] but we had him in the adult class.
[01:20:39] By the time he was 15,
[01:20:40] he was the Purple Belt National Champion,
[01:20:43] breaking off adults.
[01:20:44] Him and Chrome Grace,
[01:20:44] he made it to the finals of a tournament.
[01:20:47] They were both 15 years old.
[01:20:49] Tapped eight dudes in the way to meet each other
[01:20:51] in the finals.
[01:20:52] And it was like, you know,
[01:20:54] like dude, kids can be really tough.
[01:20:56] Oh dude, I had that conversation with Lovato,
[01:20:59] Junior, we were at ADCC.
[01:21:02] Cause he was like 17.
[01:21:04] He was actually, I know he was 17.
[01:21:06] I don't know how old I was,
[01:21:07] but I was like 20.
[01:21:08] I was maybe even, I was a grown,
[01:21:10] definitely a grown man.
[01:21:11] And I was like, dude, you beat me.
[01:21:13] He goes, I said, dude, you beat me.
[01:21:15] I said, we were Purple Bucks, you beat me.
[01:21:17] And he goes, I beat you twice.
[01:21:19] Oh, he beat me in the weight class
[01:21:22] and he beat me in the absolute, bro.
[01:21:24] And I was like, hell yeah, that's a 17 year old.
[01:21:26] I don't remember how he beat me in open,
[01:21:28] but he swept me.
[01:21:29] Like, you know, sometimes you get swept
[01:21:31] and you're just like, man,
[01:21:32] I hope no one got that on video
[01:21:34] cause you feel real ignorant.
[01:21:35] You like landed on it.
[01:21:36] Yeah, he just did like one of those sweeps to me
[01:21:38] that I was all just dumb.
[01:21:39] And, you know, it was just awesome.
[01:21:42] But yeah, a guy that's young, you know,
[01:21:45] I don't care, like a 17 year old can work out a lot,
[01:21:47] but he's not gonna be,
[01:21:48] he's not gonna have man strength yet, you know?
[01:21:50] And that was bad ass Lovato just retired.
[01:21:54] But man, we made it two rounds at ADCC
[01:21:59] against the best in the world.
[01:22:00] It's hard for me to talk about Lovato.
[01:22:02] He's a good dude.
[01:22:03] He's just.
[01:22:04] He just came to my gym.
[01:22:05] It's just so much to say.
[01:22:06] We met him from Scotty too.
[01:22:08] Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:09] Good friend of mine.
[01:22:09] There's another one, OTM.
[01:22:10] I would see him at every tournament.
[01:22:12] Yeah, we were bros.
[01:22:15] Those got, well him, you,
[01:22:16] you guys were just competitors.
[01:22:18] He would go train with Lehman a lot.
[01:22:20] A lot of people would make their way to Vegas
[01:22:22] to spend time with Lehman.
[01:22:23] And I would run into them there
[01:22:24] cause Lehman hired me as his Jiu-Jitsu teacher
[01:22:27] for two and a half years.
[01:22:29] How many classes a day were you teaching there?
[01:22:30] Like, you know, a full ton thing.
[01:22:32] Like I was doing here like four a day.
[01:22:35] I almost had that job too.
[01:22:37] It was a good job.
[01:22:38] Which one, Lehman job?
[01:22:39] Lehman job, but I went to Hilo instead.
[01:22:42] Cause what I used to do is this.
[01:22:43] I used to stay in Vegas Monday through Thursday
[01:22:47] and then drive over to Los Angeles
[01:22:51] just after I got back from Brazil.
[01:22:53] I would drive over to Los Angeles
[01:22:54] and train at Eddie Bravo's school.
[01:22:55] And that's how I met them.
[01:22:57] Joe Rogan, Eddie Bravo, Tate Fletcher.
[01:23:01] It was in the bomb squad.
[01:23:02] I had my friend Rob Kamen.
[01:23:05] He's the Dutch kickboxer and they're over there.
[01:23:07] And so, cause in Vegas, the hotel's like 40 bucks a night.
[01:23:10] I'd stay in Harrah's and the weekend like 300.
[01:23:13] I'm like, oh, I'm going to LA.
[01:23:16] I would say it's Scotty's brother's house, sometimes Cade,
[01:23:19] which was.
[01:23:20] I also used to live there.
[01:23:22] So when Scotty left Brazil,
[01:23:24] he became like the Los Angeles guy.
[01:23:26] So anytime we go to LA, we hit up Scotty.
[01:23:29] And Scotty knew everyone and everything and shoot
[01:23:33] and Glover, that's when I got hurt.
[01:23:35] You know, I was, I wanted to be an MMA fighter.
[01:23:38] So I was more interested in like, I'm like, you know,
[01:23:40] I'll put the metal aside.
[01:23:41] What was your weight?
[01:23:42] BJ Penn, I was a lightweight, light and middle.
[01:23:44] When did you guys see the no G versus the G?
[01:23:50] Like at what point did you see that as sort of
[01:23:52] what you were going to do?
[01:23:54] 80 CC, that would be like when,
[01:23:57] well, if my coach Carlson, he didn't like the G.
[01:24:00] Like, Elio Gracie put him to fight his first MMA fight
[01:24:03] with the G and he told, I'll never do that again.
[01:24:05] You're crazy.
[01:24:07] You know what I mean?
[01:24:07] He took that down and that was that.
[01:24:11] And then that Carlson,
[01:24:12] he never really used the G to use it for the kids.
[01:24:15] They use it to warm up.
[01:24:17] But the best guy is like Carlson would just grab something
[01:24:19] by the neck like this.
[01:24:21] It doesn't mean if they were a kid or not.
[01:24:22] And if they'd flinch like these,
[01:24:24] they'd be like, no, no, you're just jujitsu.
[01:24:25] And if you go like this and the kid,
[01:24:27] he's like, okay, you're fighting.
[01:24:29] He's a man.
[01:24:29] Even if they're adults, he's already old,
[01:24:32] but he's like this.
[01:24:33] And the kid's like,
[01:24:35] like a man who grabbed Nick Diaz like that,
[01:24:36] he's going to be happy.
[01:24:38] Yeah.
[01:24:39] Oh, you're about to fight.
[01:24:40] You go here.
[01:24:41] And so that's how our team was.
[01:24:44] And Carlson, he was nicer to the bigger guys.
[01:24:46] So I feel like a Rona size can be real nice to you.
[01:24:48] If you're like my size, it's kind of like,
[01:24:51] you know what, Pete?
[01:24:52] Jeff gets the same way you do.
[01:24:54] And Jeff gets around to big, big guys.
[01:24:55] He gets mean to me a little bit.
[01:24:57] Carlson the same way.
[01:25:00] No, but I'm just saying like big people,
[01:25:03] they give a good presentation as far.
[01:25:05] Like Dean, he's an example.
[01:25:06] You-
[01:25:07] I respect bigger, I respect size.
[01:25:10] I'm a little dude.
[01:25:11] Big dude scare me.
[01:25:12] He likes it.
[01:25:13] Whether they know jujitsu or not.
[01:25:14] Glover always has big friends, dude.
[01:25:16] Some strong, tough guys, dude.
[01:25:18] I come around like fuck.
[01:25:19] The weird thing about Dean is he's a mutant
[01:25:21] because he's still so flexible.
[01:25:23] He is.
[01:25:24] It's crazy.
[01:25:25] It's a weird flexibility.
[01:25:25] Dean's special.
[01:25:26] He's like the Ritolo brothers, like Glover, like BJ Penn.
[01:25:28] He's all special, like, what do you think?
[01:25:31] Glover, special people, right?
[01:25:32] We're all pretty special.
[01:25:33] Jocko, like dude.
[01:25:34] Jujitsu people are some of the coolest people
[01:25:37] in the world today.
[01:25:38] We have the DNA, like it has to be in our DNA
[01:25:41] to be a superhero, at least know something of jujitsu.
[01:25:45] Yeah, well, there's definitely a threat of like,
[01:25:48] it's, you know, they say martial arts, right?
[01:25:52] Like it's an art form.
[01:25:54] And then you think it's stereotypical artist.
[01:25:56] You think like somebody, a rock and roll artist,
[01:25:59] like he's a little bit crazy.
[01:26:00] Like a painter is a little bit crazy.
[01:26:02] A poet's a little bit crazy.
[01:26:05] Let's face it, the jujitsu player, if he's gonna be good,
[01:26:08] he's gonna be a little bit,
[01:26:09] he's gonna have a little bit,
[01:26:11] there's a decent chance I should say,
[01:26:13] he's a little bit crazy.
[01:26:14] Especially like a deep half garter
[01:26:16] to go under someone like that.
[01:26:18] Yeah.
[01:26:18] We have to be.
[01:26:19] But you gotta be, you know, when you talk to Dean,
[01:26:22] you start talking to him about jujitsu,
[01:26:24] he knows weird things about jujitsu.
[01:26:26] It's like you were saying about Glover the other day.
[01:26:28] Like you asked Glover some questions,
[01:26:29] some detailed question about some weird section of jujitsu
[01:26:32] and all of a sudden he's talking about something
[01:26:33] and you're like, how do you know that?
[01:26:34] How's it possible that you know that?
[01:26:36] That's the way Dean is.
[01:26:38] Have you ever asked Dean like,
[01:26:40] if you say Dean like,
[01:26:41] hey Dean, I'm having trouble with this triangle.
[01:26:44] And he'll say what kind of triangle?
[01:26:46] And you say, what do you mean?
[01:26:47] And he'll say, well, there's nine types of triangles.
[01:26:50] And then he'll tell you what they all are
[01:26:52] and tell you all the specifics about it.
[01:26:54] And the history.
[01:26:55] Dean needs a book like that.
[01:26:56] I think like he has some pretty cool stories.
[01:26:58] Bro, let me tell you a story about Dean.
[01:27:00] We were at an event and we were doing some jujitsu,
[01:27:04] like presenting basic jujitsu kind of self defense
[01:27:07] to a few hundred people.
[01:27:09] Yeah.
[01:27:10] And he's showing a way to escape someone's like bear hug,
[01:27:16] right?
[01:27:17] Basic jujitsu or basic self defense.
[01:27:19] So you grab a bear hug and he's showing,
[01:27:20] oh, you put the one hand in front of the face
[01:27:22] and you put the other hand underneath that one
[01:27:24] and you can make space and you push the person away.
[01:27:26] And so he shows it a couple of times,
[01:27:28] this hand goes here, this hand goes here,
[01:27:30] you push him away, make space, boom.
[01:27:32] And he goes, any questions?
[01:27:34] And a guy in the audience says,
[01:27:36] hey, I have a question.
[01:27:38] Dean says, yeah, what's the question?
[01:27:40] The guy says, I only have one hand.
[01:27:41] And he holds up like he's only got one hand.
[01:27:44] What should I do?
[01:27:46] And Dean without missing a beat,
[01:27:47] like just instantaneously goes,
[01:27:49] oh, if you only have one hand,
[01:27:50] you put this hand here, you use your shoulder.
[01:27:52] He's like had the ultimate solution for a person
[01:27:56] that only has one hand that's doing jujitsu self defense.
[01:28:00] Like that's some next level knowledge.
[01:28:05] You know what I'm saying?
[01:28:06] He can improvise because of the amount of knowledge
[01:28:08] he has when he improvises, it's not bullshit.
[01:28:11] Yeah, that's the weird thing.
[01:28:12] It didn't even, he answered it so quickly.
[01:28:14] He didn't even need to, you know,
[01:28:16] I would need to be like, well, come on out here.
[01:28:17] Let's look at it.
[01:28:18] Let me look, let's go through it.
[01:28:20] Dean like knew what to say.
[01:28:21] No, he's good.
[01:28:22] He doesn't know how to not say anything else.
[01:28:26] It was freaking crazy.
[01:28:28] Jeff, what injuries have you gotten from jujitsu?
[01:28:33] All of them, you know.
[01:28:34] What's the worst ones?
[01:28:36] I mean, I had a back surgery,
[01:28:38] but I can't even say that that happened from jujitsu.
[01:28:40] The injury itself, I don't know where that happened.
[01:28:43] I don't know how that happened,
[01:28:45] but I had like, what'd you have,
[01:28:46] my good discrepancies, what I had, you know.
[01:28:49] So they pulled some discs out,
[01:28:50] wearing your back, lower back.
[01:28:51] Yeah, my lower back.
[01:28:52] And that was the most miserable,
[01:28:55] long chronic pain I've ever had.
[01:28:58] And was it like the pain that people get down their legs?
[01:29:01] Yeah, pretty typical.
[01:29:02] Jeff was crawling around his house.
[01:29:03] No, I was crawling.
[01:29:04] It was to the point where I was, I would wake up,
[01:29:07] cry for like an hour, you know, crawl into the shower,
[01:29:12] and then crawl back to bed,
[01:29:13] call one of my friends to come feed me.
[01:29:15] I mean, it was just horrible, you know.
[01:29:16] That must be you texted me one time.
[01:29:19] Remember dude, I was like,
[01:29:20] Choco, help me.
[01:29:21] Somebody help me do my back hurts, I don't know how to.
[01:29:23] I know when Jeff Glover texted me.
[01:29:26] I know shit's getting serious.
[01:29:28] It's probably like somebody help me.
[01:29:31] It was bad, dude.
[01:29:32] I was eating advils and shit,
[01:29:33] cause I don't want to take like, I don't know.
[01:29:35] I don't want to take like pills.
[01:29:37] Yeah.
[01:29:38] I was like, I'll take the Tylenols or whatever.
[01:29:39] How long ago did you get that back surgery?
[01:29:41] That was in April.
[01:29:42] And how's the recovery?
[01:29:43] It's good.
[01:29:44] I'm back to, I mean, I mean,
[01:29:45] Choco, I wasn't even teaching classes.
[01:29:47] I couldn't, you know, I couldn't do anything.
[01:29:48] Like I'm back to, like I didn't want to be able to roll again
[01:29:54] and I'm rolling again.
[01:29:55] I was like, I was like, listen doc,
[01:29:57] I'm not trying to get you to fix me to the point
[01:29:59] where I win world titles, doc.
[01:30:00] I just want to be able to like be on the mat
[01:30:03] and show a move to somebody without crying, you know.
[01:30:06] And now I'm at the point where I'm like,
[01:30:07] shit dude, should I take matches?
[01:30:09] Like nothing hurts anymore, man.
[01:30:12] My surgeon is a jujitsu guy.
[01:30:14] He's one of Frenzy's students.
[01:30:17] And you know.
[01:30:18] And would he do a discotomy?
[01:30:19] Micro discotomy.
[01:30:20] So he pulls some little disc out,
[01:30:22] get it away from your nerves.
[01:30:23] Yeah, rupture disc, yeah, something like that.
[01:30:25] Jeff took pictures of it.
[01:30:26] Yeah, no, they recorded it.
[01:30:27] They took a whole, they recorded it.
[01:30:28] He showed like a little, looks like a little teeth.
[01:30:31] The doctor was just so kind to me, man.
[01:30:34] He, you know, he was like, you know,
[01:30:36] see you tomorrow at six a.m. for surgery.
[01:30:38] He's like, what?
[01:30:39] Doesn't take a week or nothing?
[01:30:40] He's like, no, tomorrow.
[01:30:41] See you there, got it.
[01:30:43] And just got it done.
[01:30:44] And how long did it, did the relief was like instant?
[01:30:47] As soon as I woke up from anesthesia,
[01:30:49] I was like so happy.
[01:30:51] Were you scared about getting back surgery?
[01:30:54] Not at all.
[01:30:55] You were just like, hey, I've had enough?
[01:30:56] That was done.
[01:30:57] Cause I know a lot of people, you know,
[01:31:00] they go through that time period with like,
[01:31:01] I don't want to get surgery, which I get.
[01:31:04] Because, oh yeah, well I did that.
[01:31:06] I went through that like,
[01:31:07] oh, I'm going to foundational training it away.
[01:31:10] There's like a stance that I'm going to hold for three minutes.
[01:31:12] And it's like, no, no, that shit was working.
[01:31:13] Yeah.
[01:31:14] So you tried all that stuff and it's not working.
[01:31:16] And eventually the pain gets to a point.
[01:31:17] I know people that have had surgeries
[01:31:19] and they haven't gone great and it sucks.
[01:31:22] So I generally tell people like,
[01:31:24] hey, if you can put it off, put it off.
[01:31:26] And then at a certain point you got to go,
[01:31:27] okay, look, I tried and this isn't working.
[01:31:30] And I know a lot of people that have gone just like you.
[01:31:32] They went and got surgery and they wake up and they're like,
[01:31:35] oh, I'm healed.
[01:31:37] I mean, imagine that go from debilitating pain,
[01:31:40] which is what you had, you wake up and you're healed.
[01:31:42] I did that.
[01:31:43] What surgery was that?
[01:31:44] Well, I had five.
[01:31:46] Yes.
[01:31:47] So the first one, the first one was in Hawaii,
[01:31:50] they cleaned it out, that was fixed.
[01:31:52] And then later on, like I had the Glover one in my lower back
[01:31:57] but it went bad.
[01:31:58] Sometimes with those things, like when you get it cut,
[01:32:01] the disc, the disc comes back.
[01:32:03] Your Pete's scar, your scar is so big.
[01:32:05] Like my scar that I have from the thing,
[01:32:07] you can't even see it.
[01:32:08] But when I had my car accident with the drunk drivers,
[01:32:12] I also, it made my neck numb again, my arm and my leg.
[01:32:15] So I had both.
[01:32:16] I was like, whoa.
[01:32:17] There's a good thing, right?
[01:32:18] There is.
[01:32:19] No, there's these ones.
[01:32:20] There's a little here too.
[01:32:21] I don't know, there's some.
[01:32:22] I don't know.
[01:32:24] But I have artificial discs in there.
[01:32:26] And how those work?
[01:32:27] So when they put that in there,
[01:32:29] it took away that numbness.
[01:32:31] I was just like, oh.
[01:32:33] But it still gets sore.
[01:32:35] Of course, it's not perfect.
[01:32:37] But it took away that.
[01:32:38] You're just like, oh.
[01:32:40] And I thought I was getting a dyssectomy in there,
[01:32:42] whatever they call it.
[01:32:43] I went into surgery thinking they were gonna clean it out.
[01:32:46] And I'm reading on a thing that says,
[01:32:48] disc replacements too.
[01:32:49] I'm like, oh, shit.
[01:32:50] I'm like.
[01:32:51] Disreplacements are only like 10 years old,
[01:32:53] 12 years old in the neck.
[01:32:55] Yeah.
[01:32:55] And so it's awesome, right?
[01:32:57] So he, yeah.
[01:32:57] So he says, well, I did it in,
[01:33:00] I met these people.
[01:33:01] I was, I can't tell you where I've been.
[01:33:03] I've been everywhere.
[01:33:05] But I'm also friends with Higgin Machado.
[01:33:07] And I was helping him.
[01:33:08] He was helping me.
[01:33:09] I guess we help each other.
[01:33:10] We're friends in Beverly Hills at his school.
[01:33:13] I was teaching Ashton Kutcher and all the John Wick guys.
[01:33:16] And they had recommended Daniel Bernhardt.
[01:33:19] So he's the director.
[01:33:20] He's the guy that took over.
[01:33:22] See, Michael or Daniel.
[01:33:23] He took over after Van Dam.
[01:33:24] Remember when I was like in kickboxers?
[01:33:26] Like Van Dam, then it became like some other guy.
[01:33:28] That became him.
[01:33:29] And then he is the director of all the Matrix stuff.
[01:33:33] Oh, okay.
[01:33:34] And so his kids liked me a lot.
[01:33:36] I was teaching them private lessons.
[01:33:39] Who else is it?
[01:33:40] All the, Joey Diaz.
[01:33:41] I gave, I got Joey Diaz in the jujitsu actually.
[01:33:45] He, he did a comedy show in Chicago.
[01:33:49] And he calls me, it was in Indiana.
[01:33:51] He calls me up.
[01:33:52] He's like, Peter Greek.
[01:33:53] I haven't met you, but they tell me you're the guy.
[01:33:55] If I'm in Chicago.
[01:33:56] So I went out there to his comedy show.
[01:33:58] And after his show, I'm like,
[01:34:00] he was talking about martial arts with passion.
[01:34:03] I'm like, dude, you need to join jujitsu.
[01:34:06] And he's like, serious?
[01:34:07] I'm like, and he got like a tear in his eyes.
[01:34:09] And he went back when he went back home,
[01:34:11] he actually joined.
[01:34:12] And when I show up to Higgins,
[01:34:15] I saw him there and I did a video and everything.
[01:34:17] And Higgins is a cool dude.
[01:34:20] I don't know why I even brought him up,
[01:34:21] but I just think of him, he's like a Dean.
[01:34:23] He's one of those big dudes that like,
[01:34:26] that people just feel inspired around.
[01:34:28] And she got to shoot.
[01:34:32] If those guys met Glover, they would have went nuts.
[01:34:34] Imagine they liked me, they're freaking.
[01:34:35] No, Higgins used to make a point to come to me
[01:34:38] at every tournament and say the nicest stuff to me, dog.
[01:34:41] No kidding.
[01:34:42] Like this boy is genius, is genius.
[01:34:43] You said like stuff like that back, dog.
[01:34:45] You were so cool and nice to me.
[01:34:46] Thank you.
[01:34:47] We used to hang out Dean and Higgins and I in Brazil.
[01:34:49] My dad and stuff, they was like our little crew.
[01:34:51] And that's what Higgins did.
[01:34:53] He went to everybody.
[01:34:54] Like everybody that was coming up and was cool.
[01:34:56] He would go up to them and just encourage the shit out of them.
[01:34:59] That's pretty cool.
[01:34:59] You know, there was like a zero player hater
[01:35:02] in that dude's body.
[01:35:04] And I have a rule with him.
[01:35:05] Like we're not allowed to talk about jujitsu.
[01:35:08] He likes me because I remember him of Carlson Gracie.
[01:35:10] Carlson was his favorite uncle.
[01:35:12] He's like, if the Machado brothers could have trained
[01:35:14] with anyone, they wished they would have trained with Carlson
[01:35:16] because that was this part that they didn't get into
[01:35:18] as a mixed martial arts part
[01:35:19] because they didn't have him as the coach.
[01:35:21] Like if Carlson was our coach, we would have fought.
[01:35:24] And so I remind Higgins of Carlson a lot.
[01:35:26] He loves to have me around.
[01:35:27] And I met all those high level people and Joey Diaz.
[01:35:32] And I just want to say, man, thanks
[01:35:33] because that was part of my rehab too.
[01:35:35] Was I lived at Higgins house for a while.
[01:35:39] You had rehab for your neck?
[01:35:41] Yeah, just like,
[01:35:42] or for your back.
[01:35:43] Let me think which one it was.
[01:35:44] Car accident.
[01:35:45] The car accident got both of them.
[01:35:47] Cause you got, I was on the news in Chicago.
[01:35:49] It was a big thing.
[01:35:50] Like it took me in all that stuff.
[01:35:53] And that's the gang bangers tried to run off.
[01:35:56] So they hit me and they ran off.
[01:35:58] And it was funny.
[01:35:59] I'm like, these fuckers are running
[01:36:00] and they're running away.
[01:36:01] They're running out of the minivan.
[01:36:02] They hit me and then they just start dropping
[01:36:05] cause they were injured too.
[01:36:06] And then like they take me to the hospital
[01:36:09] and they thought I was part of them.
[01:36:10] They're like, no, just listen here, buddy.
[01:36:12] I'm like, look, I'm the guy they got hit.
[01:36:14] Like we don't want to hear that.
[01:36:16] I'm like, get me out of here.
[01:36:17] And I just left.
[01:36:19] And that was like the same hospital.
[01:36:21] And you see the Joker and Batman.
[01:36:22] Like he's blowing it up.
[01:36:24] It's called St. Elizabeth.
[01:36:25] It's right over there in Chicago.
[01:36:26] I live right in Chicago.
[01:36:29] It was cool.
[01:36:30] I mean, I come from a pizza family, a hot dog family.
[01:36:33] I'm Sicilian and Greek.
[01:36:34] So my grandma's side is the Rottolos.
[01:36:38] It's funny.
[01:36:38] They're Italian.
[01:36:39] They're dad.
[01:36:40] He's actually like, I think we're cousins.
[01:36:43] We feared it out last time.
[01:36:44] Cause their, their restaurant they're related to
[01:36:47] is called La Villa.
[01:36:48] That's the last restaurant I ate at with my mom
[01:36:50] before she passed away.
[01:36:52] It's right by our house.
[01:36:53] It's one of the old, old school restaurants.
[01:36:55] Shoot.
[01:36:57] Let's like this guy was from Chicago.
[01:36:58] Chicago's, it's shy town.
[01:37:00] It's a little town.
[01:37:00] We all know each other and shoot Glover over here.
[01:37:04] I'll tell you one thing.
[01:37:05] I've met a lot of creative people.
[01:37:08] Scotty was creative like Glover in his own way
[01:37:11] as far as putting everyone together.
[01:37:13] So Scott, I know I keep bringing up Scotty,
[01:37:15] but man, I wouldn't have met any of these people
[01:37:17] without him.
[01:37:18] He like propelled Jiu-Jitsu through,
[01:37:23] provided a lot of fuel for Jiu-Jitsu
[01:37:25] when there wasn't much fuel for Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:37:27] In Brazil, he thought he was pocketed on.
[01:37:29] He thought I was Carlson.
[01:37:31] Glover's like Holes Gracie.
[01:37:33] Like maybe like different spirits find,
[01:37:35] I don't know, thinking like that.
[01:37:36] Maybe we find them, but Holes and Carlson
[01:37:39] were business partners.
[01:37:41] Holes was the best black belt from the other side
[01:37:44] of the family.
[01:37:45] And when he became black belt,
[01:37:48] he would come to Carlson's and train.
[01:37:49] And sometimes these guys would beat him.
[01:37:52] There was like two guys that could beat Holes at Carlson's
[01:37:55] and Holes says, you know, I wanna train with you guys.
[01:37:58] And so Holes came over and Carlson said,
[01:38:00] wait a minute, you're not gonna teach at my class.
[01:38:03] You can have your own class.
[01:38:06] So at Carlson's school, they had two rooms.
[01:38:09] So Carlson would teach in like room A Monday, Wednesday,
[01:38:12] Friday, and then Holes would take that room Tuesday,
[01:38:15] Thursday, Saturday, switch and go to the other room
[01:38:17] the other days.
[01:38:19] And then they would have a friendly competition
[01:38:21] between their students.
[01:38:23] And that's how they kept the level so high.
[01:38:25] So when Holes got, Holes was black belt,
[01:38:28] his best black belts were Carl, Carlinos Gracie.
[01:38:32] You know, he had Fabio Santos, he had
[01:38:35] and Carlos Gracie Jr.
[01:38:37] But most of the guys went to Carlinos when Holes died
[01:38:40] because they wanna stick with the Gracie family.
[01:38:42] But the best one of those guys, not the competitor,
[01:38:45] the most technical was Jacare Calvacante.
[01:38:47] It would be like we're Franjina comes from there.
[01:38:49] So that was the most technical of Holes.
[01:38:51] The old, the white one.
[01:38:53] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:38:54] So he,
[01:38:56] I went to his school.
[01:38:57] So that's how we're kinda like,
[01:38:57] I'm more like Carlson side, like, you know,
[01:39:00] no, it's not gonna work.
[01:39:02] And Glover's like, no, no, no, just grab me here,
[01:39:04] grab me there.
[01:39:05] So that's why we're probably friends
[01:39:07] because we kinda, we're kinda like opposites.
[01:39:11] Jeff, what was the discussion you had
[01:39:12] with Hannah Gracie the other day,
[01:39:15] sport jiu-jitsu, self-defense?
[01:39:17] What was that discussion about?
[01:39:21] Yeah, it was like a meme that I saw and it was like self,
[01:39:25] it was talking about how people in like self-defense
[01:39:28] jiu-jitsu will say something like,
[01:39:30] oh, they have problems with tournaments, sport jiu-jitsu.
[01:39:34] I don't do that sport jiu-jitsu shit.
[01:39:37] I do that self-defense style.
[01:39:38] And it was like, imagine a boxer telling you that.
[01:39:40] I've been like, I don't do that sport boxing shit.
[01:39:43] I just do that self-defense boxing.
[01:39:45] It's like, how crazy would they sound saying that?
[01:39:47] So this is someone that might think,
[01:39:49] well, you know, oh, you do that, you know,
[01:39:51] you train on a mat with a guillon, that's not realistic.
[01:39:54] So you'd get your ass kicked in a real fight.
[01:39:56] I mean, listen, whatever it was, it was a funny ass meme.
[01:39:59] And I posted it.
[01:40:00] And then one of his students, some dude,
[01:40:03] wrote just some pretty hostile like,
[01:40:06] you don't know what you're talking about, shit Glover.
[01:40:08] So I went to his page and I saw that he was like,
[01:40:10] this scrawny 35 year old dude, like my size, you know?
[01:40:16] And I'm like, I'm fucked this dude, you know?
[01:40:19] So I like, I like to go,
[01:40:21] I took a screenshot of his belt that he had
[01:40:23] because he had a belt that I had never seen.
[01:40:25] And I'm like, what is this?
[01:40:25] Some karate belt, you know?
[01:40:27] And I was like, look at this is the kind of guy
[01:40:29] who like argues with me about anything in jiu-jitsu
[01:40:31] is some dude who doesn't even do jiu-jitsu.
[01:40:33] And Hannah was like, hey, what up, Jeff?
[01:40:35] Send me a message.
[01:40:37] Da-da-da.
[01:40:37] And I found out that Hannah has his own belting system.
[01:40:40] I didn't know that dog.
[01:40:41] I didn't know that.
[01:40:41] I didn't know I was personally, he was like,
[01:40:43] oh, that was a personal attack, bro.
[01:40:45] And I was like, hey, first of all, as your friend,
[01:40:47] because I've known him for a long time
[01:40:48] since we were both like, you know, 17.
[01:40:50] I was like, as your friend,
[01:40:51] if you feel like I personally attacked you,
[01:40:52] honestly, whatever it was, I apologize.
[01:40:55] I was like, I don't wanna personally attack you.
[01:40:56] You're the man, dude.
[01:40:57] But like on a professional level,
[01:40:58] I didn't know you had your own belting system.
[01:41:01] And that I was like making fun of one of your dudes.
[01:41:04] You know what I'm saying?
[01:41:05] And he's like, yeah, dog,
[01:41:06] we have this whole system, da-da-da.
[01:41:07] He explained it to me for like an hour.
[01:41:10] And you know, I have ADD, dude.
[01:41:11] I can't be listening to you.
[01:41:12] I can't imagine you having it in one hour.
[01:41:14] Dude, I was like-
[01:41:15] I'm pretty surprised we're holding an hour right now.
[01:41:16] Well, that's how I ended the conversation.
[01:41:18] I was like, the weed is wearing off.
[01:41:20] You made your point.
[01:41:21] You know what I'm saying?
[01:41:22] I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.
[01:41:24] Yeah, we all do basic jujitsu,
[01:41:26] but I don't think like,
[01:41:28] I don't think like people who only do self-defense
[01:41:30] will ever be able to beat somebody who does sport jujitsu.
[01:41:34] And that's the end of my point.
[01:41:36] I had a guy on social media over the last couple of days.
[01:41:40] He posted something.
[01:41:41] I wish I could get the exact quote for you.
[01:41:44] But it was something like this.
[01:41:45] And I get the spirit of what he was saying.
[01:41:48] He said, you know, I know this guy,
[01:41:51] it was something along the lines like,
[01:41:52] this guy wants me to train jujitsu,
[01:41:55] but I told him, listen,
[01:41:57] there's a difference between jujitsu and crazy old Marine.
[01:42:02] And you're not going to be armbar in me
[01:42:06] when I'm gouging eyes, right?
[01:42:08] And so that was the comment.
[01:42:09] And he kind of like thought,
[01:42:10] he probably thought like I'd be like, hell yeah,
[01:42:12] because I love the Marines and I love the military.
[01:42:15] But I haven't responded to him yet,
[01:42:17] but I'm going to respond to him.
[01:42:18] And I'm going to say, hey, bro, like,
[01:42:20] actually you're not going to be gouging anybody's eyes
[01:42:22] when you're getting choked and arm locked
[01:42:24] because that's what's really going to happen.
[01:42:26] And, you know, Dean always has a good explanation of like,
[01:42:29] oh, you know, some of the guy will say to Dean,
[01:42:34] like, well, yeah, I would just like bite your face.
[01:42:36] And Dean, Dean's like, yeah, cool, then I'll be mad.
[01:42:40] Yeah. Nice.
[01:42:40] You know, cause then you make Dean mad.
[01:42:43] Well, you make a jujitsu guy mad.
[01:42:44] So now when they're mounted on you,
[01:42:47] like they're gonna bite your face.
[01:42:48] Yeah, we had a friend here that was a seal,
[01:42:52] a jujitsu guy and he got into a street fight.
[01:42:55] And he like was a cross side on the dude.
[01:42:59] You might remember, he got his ear bitten off,
[01:43:00] like kind of not bitten off, but like,
[01:43:02] if you took a piece of pizza and like turned it to the side
[01:43:06] and took a bite, not out of like this,
[01:43:08] the tip of the triangle, but like out of the side,
[01:43:11] it looked like that, like just a bite was gone.
[01:43:13] You know what I'm saying?
[01:43:14] Like a bite was gone of this dude, of this seal's ear.
[01:43:19] But now what happened in the fight?
[01:43:21] Now he was pissed.
[01:43:23] Oh, man.
[01:43:24] Oh yeah, I mean, he just like annihilated this guy,
[01:43:26] could have killed him or whatever.
[01:43:28] But yeah, so that self-defense stuff of like,
[01:43:31] well, I'll kick you in the nuts or I'll gouge you
[01:43:36] or I'll fish hook you.
[01:43:37] No, you actually, or you may, maybe you will,
[01:43:40] but it's not gonna help.
[01:43:41] It's not gonna help.
[01:43:42] And the other thing is like, oh, well, oh, jujitsu,
[01:43:45] why would you wanna go to the ground in self-defense?
[01:43:48] Don't wanna go to the ground in self-defense.
[01:43:49] Hopefully you don't have to.
[01:43:50] Hopefully you just knock a dude out, you know?
[01:43:52] Hopefully you just, you know, give him a nice one, two, three
[01:43:55] and the dude's knocked out and you move on,
[01:43:56] carry on with your day.
[01:43:57] Yeah, but we landed there and now we're here.
[01:43:59] Yeah, but all of a sudden I got, you know, gang tackled
[01:44:03] or tackled by somebody or a trip to fell.
[01:44:05] And now the only way I can handle this situation
[01:44:07] is if I know how to get back all my feet
[01:44:08] and do jujitsu or unbox somebody or whatever.
[01:44:11] And I'm a purple belt pan am champ,
[01:44:12] so guess what's gonna happen?
[01:44:13] Yeah, we do all that shit you just said.
[01:44:16] Yeah, yeah, it's gonna be not good.
[01:44:20] So yeah, that's definitely something to think about.
[01:44:23] Have you ever had, how has jujitsu performed for you
[01:44:27] in the streets?
[01:44:28] I mean, I've never lost a street fight.
[01:44:32] I'm a witness.
[01:44:34] What is your go-to move in a street fight?
[01:44:38] No, you're not.
[01:44:39] You've never seen me fight anybody.
[01:44:43] I'm a witness.
[01:44:44] Oh no, I'm not a witness.
[01:44:45] That's right.
[01:44:46] Ripping statement.
[01:44:50] Dude, you know what?
[01:44:51] You're just imagining how kick ass it would be.
[01:44:53] But that's what happens when Glover tells you
[01:44:55] about a fight that he had, it's like, I'm there.
[01:44:57] Like I already imagined it,
[01:44:57] cause I know his moves, he's like, yeah,
[01:44:59] I double-legged the guy, ran around him, I left at him.
[01:45:02] He tried to chase me.
[01:45:03] That must be so crazy.
[01:45:04] That's what I was trying to say with Hinner,
[01:45:05] is that Hinner is like, he fails to mention
[01:45:08] that he's a bad ass wrestler dog.
[01:45:10] He's a dope ass boxer.
[01:45:12] You know what I'm saying?
[01:45:13] It's like, how did you win streets fights?
[01:45:14] I'm like, I never really used jujitsu.
[01:45:16] I always like faked double legs
[01:45:18] and then punched the shit out of you
[01:45:20] when they fell to the, oh, I'm gonna get double-legged
[01:45:22] and I punched them and I was like,
[01:45:23] well, didn't even use any jujitsu there.
[01:45:26] But, but, no.
[01:45:27] Well, my coach was with, with Ilyo.
[01:45:29] He was, he was his best student.
[01:45:32] Look, on this subject, it's like I started off with,
[01:45:34] many truths exist at the same time with this subject.
[01:45:37] Oh.
[01:45:38] They're both true and they're both exist at the same time.
[01:45:42] And it's almost pointless to talk about this.
[01:45:43] What do you call it, a paradox?
[01:45:45] What do you call that?
[01:45:46] I don't know, what do you guys call that?
[01:45:47] They're like loaded in questions.
[01:45:47] They sound like something echoing.
[01:45:48] As far as like jujitsu.
[01:45:49] Yeah, I do a lot of times when people have a strong argument
[01:45:53] for against their, they look at it, what my brother would
[01:45:56] call it in a vacuum.
[01:45:58] So they'll take a very individual thing unchallenged
[01:46:00] in the real world kind of a thing.
[01:46:02] And then a concept.
[01:46:04] No, I'm not saying jujitsu as a whole.
[01:46:06] Just like how you said,
[01:46:07] bro, there's so many truths going on in there.
[01:46:09] But I'm saying a concept and then they'll challenge it
[01:46:11] against sometimes a straw man, but sometimes not another
[01:46:15] in the vacuum concept and then they'll go to battle.
[01:46:18] But a lot of times, especially kind of what you were saying
[01:46:22] in that debate.
[01:46:23] Do you know what straw man is Pete?
[01:46:24] No.
[01:46:25] Like the worst example.
[01:46:26] I'll let Echo explain it.
[01:46:27] In a nutshell, it's like the worst example of someone's
[01:46:30] side, it's usually like inaccurate.
[01:46:32] Oh, I got it, now I understand.
[01:46:35] But either way, like when you talk about a competitor
[01:46:38] in jujitsu and then the other side would be like,
[01:46:41] oh, you would never pull guard on the street,
[01:46:44] which is true, but then they're representing that
[01:46:47] as like their position.
[01:46:48] I wouldn't say never.
[01:46:50] I wouldn't never say never.
[01:46:50] They'd say they'd say never.
[01:46:52] They'd say they'd say never.
[01:46:53] They'd say they'd say never.
[01:46:53] They'd say they'd say never.
[01:46:54] And then even that, that's not necessarily true.
[01:46:57] Maybe for Jeff and that's all.
[01:46:59] No, because if you jump full guard,
[01:47:00] you're gonna land straight on the pavement.
[01:47:02] And to Henners credit, he did say some things that,
[01:47:06] I think the jujitsu community wanted to hear him say.
[01:47:08] I asked him if he thought John Danerher was the number one
[01:47:11] dude in the world right now.
[01:47:12] What did he say?
[01:47:12] I'm like, is we all agree on that?
[01:47:13] Do you agree with that?
[01:47:14] Or are you gonna say your grandpa?
[01:47:16] You don't say anything?
[01:47:17] He said, yeah, John Daner is number one.
[01:47:18] I can't deny that.
[01:47:19] Cool.
[01:47:20] And I was like, okay, do you think jujitsu guys
[01:47:22] who do tournaments can win street fights?
[01:47:25] And he was like, yes, I agree with that.
[01:47:26] Well, you know, I was like, cool, that's all I was saying.
[01:47:29] I was like, I don't disagree with anything he says.
[01:47:31] Yeah, and see, and then that's,
[01:47:32] so the conflict really comes when the interchangeability
[01:47:36] of generalities versus specifics kind of goes on.
[01:47:38] And that's how it goes.
[01:47:39] It's not going deep right now.
[01:47:40] No, I meant, yeah.
[01:47:41] I'm just gonna say that.
[01:47:42] And look, if someone could always say,
[01:47:44] generally speaking, if someone always could say that,
[01:47:46] and then when they go specific, they say, well, specific.
[01:47:49] That's great.
[01:47:50] A lot of specifics have no place in a general argument.
[01:47:53] That's great.
[01:47:54] So people don't understand that.
[01:47:55] So they get this, this week's console.
[01:47:56] Line jujitsu coming out of a freaking apple top.
[01:47:59] It's the way it works.
[01:48:00] See it happening all the time.
[01:48:01] Write that down, Pete.
[01:48:03] Jeff, generalities are different in specifics.
[01:48:06] Yeah.
[01:48:08] I always say I'm one of the worst people
[01:48:10] to introduce people to jujitsu because I'm like big and strong.
[01:48:15] And so if I, when I would like introduce someone to jujitsu,
[01:48:18] they'd be like, well, that's just because you're big and strong.
[01:48:21] Matter of fact, to this day, someone will be like, well,
[01:48:22] yeah, good role.
[01:48:23] You're really strong.
[01:48:25] You're big and strong or whatever.
[01:48:26] And I'm always like, yeah, thanks, man.
[01:48:27] That's why I lift.
[01:48:28] Hell yeah.
[01:48:29] But Jeff, I think you're like, I think you're the ultimate.
[01:48:34] I lift too, but yeah.
[01:48:35] I think you're the ultimate person
[01:48:36] to introduce jujitsu to other people
[01:48:39] because you are unassuming.
[01:48:41] And what made me think of that is, dude,
[01:48:43] I can't imagine the fool and how crappy it is when someone sees
[01:48:50] you and they're like, I'm going to talk some shit to this little
[01:48:53] skinny white kid right now.
[01:48:54] Oh, it happens.
[01:48:57] I've been a witness.
[01:48:58] Wait.
[01:48:59] I know nothing.
[01:49:03] Aren't you Mexican though?
[01:49:05] My dad is half Mexican now, pretty much.
[01:49:08] So you are Mexican, is that it?
[01:49:10] Yeah.
[01:49:10] Well, my dad.
[01:49:11] Boy, you look like a white boy, man.
[01:49:12] He speaks Spanish.
[01:49:13] He's like half white, half Cherokee Indian.
[01:49:17] But they would just say Mexican.
[01:49:18] Wait, your dad is half white and half Cherokee Indian.
[01:49:21] Is your mom like the whitest person ever?
[01:49:24] She is, yeah.
[01:49:25] Because damn.
[01:49:26] Yeah, I'm white.
[01:49:27] You are white.
[01:49:29] Dude, it would look crazy when I'd be with my grandma.
[01:49:31] People would think she like kidnapped me.
[01:49:33] All right.
[01:49:38] ADCC.
[01:49:39] So speaking of which, I saw you up there this year.
[01:49:42] What did you think of everything?
[01:49:44] What was your impression?
[01:49:45] Let me start off by saying this.
[01:49:46] Yeah, it's great.
[01:49:48] Bro, when I went and saw you when I was talking about going
[01:49:50] to see you at the ADCC trials, that was literally in like a,
[01:49:55] what was it, in like a hotel back room or something?
[01:49:58] There's a hotel ballroom.
[01:49:59] Yeah, like a hotel ballroom.
[01:50:00] Not a nice hotel either, but just like some shitty hotel.
[01:50:03] And they put some mats on the floor.
[01:50:05] I thought it was nice.
[01:50:06] There's like 200 people watching, right?
[01:50:08] Less than that.
[01:50:09] Less than that.
[01:50:10] Just the people there.
[01:50:11] There was no one to be watching.
[01:50:12] Yeah, actually, there's just people competing and then
[01:50:14] there's people competing and then watching others compete.
[01:50:16] Yeah.
[01:50:19] This one was crazy.
[01:50:20] It was epic.
[01:50:22] There was 15,000 people in a big damn stadium.
[01:50:26] And the Jiu Jitsu was just freaking nuts to watch.
[01:50:31] It was nuts to watch.
[01:50:32] What are you seeing in the evolution of Jiu Jitsu right now?
[01:50:36] It's interesting, right?
[01:50:37] And I have a very interesting perspective.
[01:50:38] I wish I could explain it.
[01:50:40] I wish I had the vocabulary to explain that.
[01:50:42] But remember when you first saw those first ADCC matches
[01:50:47] with the chic and they're like, the drums
[01:50:53] and the Arab dudes playing drums in the background?
[01:50:55] And it was something so magical.
[01:50:57] It was like being a kid again.
[01:50:58] It was like all of a sudden, remember when you found out
[01:51:01] pro wrestling was fake?
[01:51:03] You know what I'm saying?
[01:51:04] You were so heartbroken.
[01:51:05] I was.
[01:51:06] And then I found Abu Dhabi.
[01:51:07] And I was like, oh my god, it's not like pro wrestling's real
[01:51:09] again.
[01:51:09] It's real.
[01:51:10] You know, these dudes are real real.
[01:51:12] Like Dean's a real fucking pro.
[01:51:13] Like Macho Man is like, you know, that was like Dean Lister.
[01:51:17] Dean's Lister is like a real life Macho Man.
[01:51:18] You know?
[01:51:20] So yeah, it's just every year it's always so special.
[01:51:24] You could go back and watch ADCC 1996 and untrained eye
[01:51:29] and watch that shit and be like, wow, that's fucking amazing.
[01:51:32] I can't imagine somebody who just started Jiu Jitsu last year
[01:51:35] watching ADCC and being like, oh, what am I getting myself
[01:51:38] into?
[01:51:38] That was crazy.
[01:51:40] You know, am I going to be doing that?
[01:51:41] Like, whoa.
[01:51:42] It's just, yeah, it's, I don't know how people don't want to do it.
[01:51:48] What do you think about the evolution of the game?
[01:51:52] Like what it looks like now?
[01:51:54] It's a tough question.
[01:51:55] People ask that one.
[01:51:56] That's a tough one.
[01:51:56] I don't know.
[01:51:57] Has it really evolved?
[01:51:58] We're all just going for neck, arms, and legs.
[01:52:00] Yeah, that's true.
[01:52:01] I was pleasantly surprised the last couple
[01:52:04] matches in big tournaments I've been watching because like,
[01:52:08] I'll be here and training.
[01:52:11] And like, this is an example.
[01:52:14] I'm freaking trying to pass Dean's Guard,
[01:52:16] trying to pass Wes' Guard, whatever.
[01:52:19] What's your, like, Echo's Guard.
[01:52:20] Like, they spend a lot of time trying to pass Guard.
[01:52:24] And man, sometimes I think, dude, I just suck at Jiu Jitsu.
[01:52:27] Now I need to freaking, you know, like just find a new sport
[01:52:30] to go start playing croquet or some shit, you know, like.
[01:52:32] Why, because you're bored?
[01:52:34] No, because I suck.
[01:52:35] And I'm like, dude, I suck.
[01:52:37] And then we'll go and watch, like, at ECC.
[01:52:39] I was like, I was watching.
[01:52:40] I was like, that's right.
[01:52:42] And I'd realized this six months ago.
[01:52:45] I was like, oh, this is what Jiu Jitsu looks like more now.
[01:52:48] People are better.
[01:52:49] Their guard is better.
[01:52:51] Their leg attacks are better.
[01:52:53] You can't dive into stuff the way you could.
[01:52:56] Everyone's just better.
[01:52:58] So it takes more skill and more time to pass the Guard.
[01:53:02] And as I watched all these matches, I'm like, yeah,
[01:53:04] this is, it's just a different game.
[01:53:07] Now there are evolutions that are happening right now.
[01:53:11] And I'm seeing like, Pete, you were talking about them
[01:53:13] some of the other night.
[01:53:14] Well, we're trying to do like, OK, so with the IBGF
[01:53:17] tournaments that were before, well, they still have them now.
[01:53:22] You don't have to be specifically too good at that many skills.
[01:53:25] You could be good at two or three positions
[01:53:27] and hold the person and win.
[01:53:29] But now at these tournaments are submission only,
[01:53:32] or Glover has a tenor tap system.
[01:53:34] There's ADCC systems.
[01:53:36] You're getting penalized for just holding a guy in one
[01:53:39] position.
[01:53:40] So with no g, you're not going to be able to hold anyone down
[01:53:44] under sweaty.
[01:53:45] So what people are doing now is leaning on the person
[01:53:48] and making them carry the weight.
[01:53:50] And then on the bottom, you're pretty much.
[01:53:53] That's not changed.
[01:53:54] It's always been like that.
[01:53:55] I guess so.
[01:53:55] I'm finding more of the evolutions coming in.
[01:53:57] OK, pretty much.
[01:53:58] I'm failing to find that.
[01:54:00] Yeah, there's, yeah, it's just like.
[01:54:02] It's just different styles.
[01:54:03] It's always going to look.
[01:54:04] That's what's so cool about this.
[01:54:04] It's always new and what's new is old.
[01:54:05] Look at these old Greek guys like Achilles and Zeus.
[01:54:08] And like those dudes knew how to grapple.
[01:54:11] I guarantee you, like, who are you kidding?
[01:54:13] Didn't he come up with the Achilles lock?
[01:54:14] Yeah, all that stuff.
[01:54:15] You know what I mean?
[01:54:16] They had the wristlock guy.
[01:54:18] They had all that stuff.
[01:54:19] When did you get all freaking focused on wristlocks
[01:54:22] while we're going down this rabbit hole?
[01:54:23] OK, so when I lived in Brazil, I lost it.
[01:54:28] In the world, it was like my fifth match in Oswaldo
[01:54:31] Alves there.
[01:54:31] He's an old guy with Andre Gauvara.
[01:54:33] Just tell the story kind of faster.
[01:54:34] The way he's wearing off.
[01:54:36] Come on, Peter.
[01:54:36] So they come live with us.
[01:54:38] And this old guy is the wristlock master.
[01:54:41] Can I tell your story for you?
[01:54:42] Stop.
[01:54:43] And then he taught me a couple wristlocks.
[01:54:46] And then when I hurt my back, I couldn't do arm bars anymore.
[01:54:49] So if you grab the arm, you got to spin all the way around.
[01:54:52] Like Glover, you seem to grab some arm.
[01:54:54] He's jumping around.
[01:54:56] I just, I focus on the wrist and elbow and I snap it.
[01:54:59] And if it works, it works.
[01:55:02] If it doesn't work, I use it to pass the guard.
[01:55:04] You could see like Cade Ritolo, he used a wristlock.
[01:55:07] And it's Mika Galvan.
[01:55:09] He starts snapping his wrist.
[01:55:11] You highlighted that.
[01:55:12] Mika pulls out.
[01:55:14] And then he starts coming around, circling,
[01:55:17] goes back to the center, goes again.
[01:55:19] Mika hides his wrist, gives him the pass, and he takes the leg.
[01:55:23] And then he stuck his leg in.
[01:55:24] And I only had these videos out for a couple of years.
[01:55:27] Now mind you, I came out wristlocked the world
[01:55:30] when I was living with Glover.
[01:55:31] We're sitting over there in National City over here
[01:55:33] working with you guys.
[01:55:35] And I was so pissed, I was like, fuck the world.
[01:55:38] I'm like, no.
[01:55:41] Wristlocked the world.
[01:55:43] Wristlocked, butting.
[01:55:47] Like, yeah.
[01:55:48] Glover's like, fuck you, Pete.
[01:55:51] I need something like that.
[01:55:52] Come up with something like that for me.
[01:55:54] And then it just took off.
[01:55:57] You know, I started WTW, stands for a lot of things.
[01:56:01] PTG stands for past a guard, past a guac.
[01:56:06] Past a guard.
[01:56:06] Pressure the guard.
[01:56:07] Pressure the guard.
[01:56:09] Pray to whomever you choose.
[01:56:12] There's a lot of things.
[01:56:14] And man, doing Jitsu at Glover is fun.
[01:56:17] And I can honestly say, I don't have, like, you had Bill,
[01:56:22] or you had Dean.
[01:56:22] I had Carlson.
[01:56:23] He passed away.
[01:56:24] So I was like, my guy is gone.
[01:56:26] So thank God I end up in the best rooms with the best people
[01:56:29] that love Jiu Jitsu.
[01:56:30] And lately, I've been somehow ended up with the Rotolo
[01:56:34] Brothers.
[01:56:35] With them every day, we do this foundations training.
[01:56:39] And then we do, like, spears like this.
[01:56:40] And all this stuff is fixing them.
[01:56:43] But I get to be around them.
[01:56:44] So it's fixing me.
[01:56:45] And the guys are, like, living in Hawaii,
[01:56:48] where I got hurt initially.
[01:56:50] And so it's all coming full circle.
[01:56:52] And that's what's so cool about martial arts is,
[01:56:56] comes around full circle.
[01:56:57] Last time we were here, was there a Jocko podcast
[01:57:00] when we were here years ago?
[01:57:01] Like, I don't even know.
[01:57:02] This has only been around for about six years?
[01:57:05] Seven years?
[01:57:06] Seven years, yeah.
[01:57:07] Which is weird.
[01:57:08] So it's all coming full circle.
[01:57:10] And I think the more you love Jiu Jitsu, the more it'll love you.
[01:57:13] And Jeff and I have made how many videos?
[01:57:16] I mean, like, I showed up to BJJ Fanatics.
[01:57:18] I made Rislock the World.
[01:57:20] Dana hers the one that actually got me that job.
[01:57:23] Like, I don't know him so well, but he gets a kick out of me.
[01:57:26] And they call me up, Bernardo called me up,
[01:57:28] and I show up there.
[01:57:29] And I seen they had a Jeff Glover DVD in their own collection.
[01:57:33] It was with, like, another company.
[01:57:35] I forgot their name.
[01:57:37] I thought Pete was full of shit.
[01:57:39] I was like, dude, Pete's full of shit.
[01:57:40] I'm like, Glover, what am I supposed to do here?
[01:57:42] I've been here like...
[01:57:43] Full of shit about what?
[01:57:44] Just everything he said.
[01:57:45] I was like, this dude's just, he lies about all kinds of shit.
[01:57:47] He always thinks I'm a scammer because he hasn't met, like,
[01:57:50] I'm Sasain in Greek.
[01:57:51] He's used to, like, Mexican, white...
[01:57:54] And then met the owner of the company.
[01:57:55] He met me before.
[01:57:56] He thinks I'm a scammer.
[01:57:57] Wait, this is BJJ Fanatics.
[01:57:58] Yeah.
[01:57:59] And when the guy, he was like, oh yeah, just passively.
[01:58:01] He's like, yeah, Dean gets these bubble blood checks every month.
[01:58:04] I was like, what?
[01:58:05] I'm like, Glover, get your ass over it.
[01:58:06] He's like, fuck you, Pete, I'm not leaving San Diego.
[01:58:09] Yeah, I was like, I don't want to go out there.
[01:58:11] He's like, go back.
[01:58:12] He's like, go to...
[01:58:13] He's cold out there.
[01:58:14] He's cold out there.
[01:58:15] I'm like, all right, Glover.
[01:58:16] And then I get out of there and shit, and then Glover always...
[01:58:18] We always try to top each other.
[01:58:20] That's what's really cool.
[01:58:21] Like, so, like...
[01:58:22] What we do is we hang out extremely a lot and then we disband and we try to like come
[01:58:28] up with who can come up with more stuff.
[01:58:30] But I got hurt before him.
[01:58:32] So like the people are like, they got to really be into it to know me.
[01:58:37] They got to pretty much be into it to know him.
[01:58:40] They don't even got to be into it to know Joe Rogan.
[01:58:42] Joe Rogan, like he's the one that probably like...
[01:58:44] He's like the Scotty now.
[01:58:46] He's like...
[01:58:47] He's like...
[01:58:48] You know what I mean?
[01:58:50] The Scotty was like that for us as kids.
[01:58:53] But now you got like Joe Rogan and we're all friends.
[01:58:57] Eddie Bravo.
[01:58:58] Eddie's our good friend.
[01:58:59] Like, shoot, like...
[01:59:01] He does the other half guard, you know?
[01:59:03] What do they call him?
[01:59:05] Lockdown.
[01:59:06] So like Nemesis, Glover and Eddie.
[01:59:09] They're kind of like...
[01:59:10] They're from the same planet or something.
[01:59:12] I don't know, but he's my other good buddy.
[01:59:15] Shoot, he gets a kick out of it.
[01:59:17] And we're all connected.
[01:59:18] And Joe Rogan, hey, thanks a lot because every Jitsu school in the world should think that
[01:59:25] guy.
[01:59:26] For sure.
[01:59:27] Period.
[01:59:28] Right?
[01:59:29] Yeah, for sure.
[01:59:30] Spreading the word.
[01:59:31] And Joey Diaz, I gave him that class.
[01:59:33] Changed his life.
[01:59:34] He put the video out and shout out to him too.
[01:59:37] Because he's...
[01:59:39] And he knows everything about martial arts, believe it or not.
[01:59:42] He did Kung Fu and all that stuff.
[01:59:43] And I looked at him and I said, you know what?
[01:59:45] You need to get on the match, brother.
[01:59:48] And I talked to him at least once a week.
[01:59:49] Like when my mom was on hospice, we call up Joey.
[01:59:53] He thinks he's really...
[01:59:54] He's like, yeah, this is your uncle from your mom's side.
[01:59:56] It's weird.
[01:59:57] It's like we're really related.
[01:59:58] And cool dude.
[02:00:00] He loves Glover.
[02:00:01] I know everyone is...
[02:00:02] Yes or no?
[02:00:03] Like dude, these guys call me...
[02:00:07] Spit that shit, dude.
[02:00:08] Look, my mom's sick.
[02:00:09] My mom just passed away a few weeks ago.
[02:00:11] Look, Eddie Bravo calls up every night, plays music for her.
[02:00:15] Crazy.
[02:00:16] That's awesome, man.
[02:00:17] Eddie follows me up.
[02:00:18] Do you guys remember the Eddie Bravo video that was Cribs?
[02:00:22] Oh yeah, I'm in that video.
[02:00:25] I tried to find it on...
[02:00:26] It's not on YouTube.
[02:00:27] But we got to get the access to that.
[02:00:29] I got it at home.
[02:00:30] It's called the Twister.
[02:00:31] I'm on the Easter egg.
[02:00:32] So if you go up, down, left, right, up, down, left, right, I show up.
[02:00:35] Yeah, so it was on that DVD.
[02:00:37] So that's why I have it.
[02:00:38] So I must have it.
[02:00:39] But I don't even have a DVD player anymore.
[02:00:41] Yeah, there's a way you press up, down, left, right.
[02:00:44] They're called Easter eggs.
[02:00:45] Scotty's brother, Kate, who's like a computer genius.
[02:00:48] This guy put it in there.
[02:00:49] So when you put the little code in and I pop up and Eddie Bravo, yeah, he's...
[02:00:54] Shoot, just a regular dude like us.
[02:00:56] And then next thing you know, he's another one.
[02:00:59] Like shoot, 10 planet.
[02:01:00] They're everywhere.
[02:01:01] Yeah.
[02:01:02] They're nice to Glover and I.
[02:01:03] Like we've been to how many 10 planet schools teaching seminars.
[02:01:07] It's one thing that's cool.
[02:01:10] Back in the day, it seemed like there was more animosity.
[02:01:12] And maybe there still is, but between Jiu Jitsu schools and all that stuff, it seems like
[02:01:18] that's not so...
[02:01:19] Definitely, what?
[02:01:20] Let me say it doesn't even seem.
[02:01:21] They're definitely not that as much animosity as there used to be between, or maybe it's
[02:01:25] just between all the people we know.
[02:01:27] We're in their systems.
[02:01:28] You know, they have moves named after Glover.
[02:01:31] They have wrist socks after me.
[02:01:32] I'm sure they have moves.
[02:01:34] When you're part of someone's system, there's no denying it.
[02:01:38] Glover's got like, they have like moves and they have a system of moves.
[02:01:43] Like they have like, how can you not be friends with your inner system?
[02:01:47] Geez.
[02:01:48] Well, right on.
[02:01:49] So what, so if guys are looking to follow you guys now, I want to do a seminar.
[02:01:54] How do they get to do a Jeff Glover seminar in their Academy?
[02:01:57] I have the same booking agent that Dean has.
[02:02:00] It's a guy named Dave Herbert.
[02:02:02] So where do they go?
[02:02:03] Like is it a website?
[02:02:04] Striker's International.
[02:02:05] It's a, it's a, it's a, you know, booking agency where he does seminars for striking
[02:02:10] people and whatever.
[02:02:12] Dean came to my tournament, introduced me to the guy, bought a Bing, bought a Boom.
[02:02:15] He's booking all of our seminars for us and making it easy.
[02:02:18] So Striker's International on Instagram is the guy's page.
[02:02:23] And or you could just contact me on Instagram and we can book seminars and flat rate and
[02:02:27] all that stuff.
[02:02:28] And your, and your Instagram is Jeff, Jeff Glover BJJ.
[02:02:32] That's right.
[02:02:33] You guys are both, you already mentioned this, BJJ Fanatics, which is a compilation website
[02:02:37] of all the best guys in the world making videos, instructional videos.
[02:02:43] Both you guys are on there.
[02:02:44] We have a lot of content.
[02:02:46] Most of the people have a couple of videos.
[02:02:47] Jeff and I are there a lot.
[02:02:49] Like we have between the both of us who made probably 40 videos in a past year and a half.
[02:02:54] And I'm, I'm just, I just started working with Striker's International too.
[02:02:59] So you could contact them or you could find us.
[02:03:01] Do to remind me after this, let's talk to the boys at BJJ Fanatics and put like a special
[02:03:06] on when this comes out.
[02:03:07] You know what I'm saying?
[02:03:08] So maybe people could buy like a, like 10 of your videos or something in a package or
[02:03:13] something.
[02:03:14] There's always like, even if you buy one video, every little bit helps, you know, Jeff and
[02:03:18] I actually taught, we taught a lot of classes.
[02:03:20] I remember we taught the, we taught the Marines together and stuff.
[02:03:23] Yeah.
[02:03:24] Joel Hoffman, remember?
[02:03:25] Colonel Joel, you trained here?
[02:03:26] Yeah.
[02:03:27] So there's no discrimination.
[02:03:28] We're here to teach, you know?
[02:03:29] If you're watching this years from now on Instagram, maybe it doesn't even exist.
[02:03:33] Who knows?
[02:03:34] You can always find us Pete the Greek, you know what I mean?
[02:03:36] Jiu-Jitsu and Jeff Glover, Jiu-Jitsu and Jocko.
[02:03:40] You could find us if you want us.
[02:03:41] Echo to it only, Vecho.
[02:03:42] He's a black belt.
[02:03:43] He's a black belt.
[02:03:44] All these guys, you know what I mean?
[02:03:45] You're at Pete the Greek, wristlock the world.
[02:03:48] Is that one big thing on Instagram?
[02:03:49] Is it that whole thing or is it just Pete the Greek?
[02:03:51] That whole thing.
[02:03:52] Pete the Greek.
[02:03:53] There's some other Pete the Greek guy that's kind of fake.
[02:03:56] Your BJJ school is called RioBjj.com.
[02:04:01] Let's see, what's the...
[02:04:03] And that's also where you can get t-shirts or whatever.
[02:04:07] Just go to wristlocktheworld.com.
[02:04:09] I bought that one.
[02:04:10] Oh, okay.
[02:04:11] It brings you to everything.
[02:04:12] I'm at Instagram.
[02:04:13] wristlocktheworld.com.
[02:04:14] I put a link tree so you can set up all your links.
[02:04:17] And like I said, if Instagram's not around in the future, you can always find us.
[02:04:22] You know, we do Jiu-Jitsu.
[02:04:24] You'll find Glover in the Greek.
[02:04:28] Right on.
[02:04:29] And the Ritola brothers, I want to give a shout out to them because my mom just passed away.
[02:04:33] I was feeling down, Jeff all the way in Santa Barbara and these kids, like, I don't know,
[02:04:39] I have a good connection with them.
[02:04:42] And they're about the only ones as cool as watching Glover as far as I'm concerned.
[02:04:47] Because most of the matches, I fall asleep.
[02:04:49] And these guys, I get that.
[02:04:51] They're the only ones that remind me of Glover.
[02:04:53] I just want to add, when his mom died, I showed up.
[02:04:57] No, Glover's great.
[02:04:58] It sounded like I wasn't there, motherfucker.
[02:05:00] I was there for that.
[02:05:01] Okay.
[02:05:02] Glover was in Santa Barbara.
[02:05:03] I came to be with you.
[02:05:04] No, my mom looked at me.
[02:05:05] She goes, I'm tired of seeing.
[02:05:06] I'm tired of seeing.
[02:05:07] Is anyone listening?
[02:05:08] Things I'm a bad friend.
[02:05:09] That's not true.
[02:05:10] My mom's a big mo.
[02:05:11] She's from Chicago.
[02:05:12] And my grandma's Leona.
[02:05:13] These are all like pizza people.
[02:05:15] My grandma's the first woman in Chicago to have a restaurant, a business.
[02:05:20] So a shout out to Shaitown, dude.
[02:05:22] Shout out.
[02:05:23] You know what I mean?
[02:05:25] Right on.
[02:05:26] Awesome.
[02:05:27] Echo, you got anything else?
[02:05:28] Oh yeah, a couple things.
[02:05:29] Sandy Beach.
[02:05:30] That's real.
[02:05:31] Sandy Beach is on a Wahoo though, by the way.
[02:05:32] It's not in Hilo.
[02:05:33] They might have taken me there.
[02:05:34] They're on somewhere.
[02:05:35] Hey, we're going to go.
[02:05:36] We're going to go training.
[02:05:37] Oh yeah.
[02:05:38] So it's very notorious for the short break.
[02:05:42] You Google break that beach.
[02:05:44] Short pound, sure, if you will.
[02:05:45] I'm saying in this scenario, it's probably appropriate to go to a short pound.
[02:05:48] Oh yeah.
[02:05:49] And it's super common for guys to get injured there.
[02:05:51] So they post signs and all that stuff.
[02:05:54] But you know.
[02:05:55] P. degree, can't read no signs.
[02:05:56] No way.
[02:05:57] When you're going with the boys, they're going.
[02:05:58] Yeah, the local guys, they don't.
[02:05:59] Yeah, so you got to watch out though for that.
[02:06:02] It's notorious for that kind of stuff.
[02:06:04] Or the short break.
[02:06:05] Yes.
[02:06:06] Built my spirit.
[02:06:07] Watch out for Sandy Beach.
[02:06:08] Spirit.
[02:06:09] Secondly, I think I figured out maybe 5, 10% of your whole thing.
[02:06:15] Who?
[02:06:16] Jeff Glover.
[02:06:17] Jeff Glover.
[02:06:18] Please inform us.
[02:06:19] You like, you took the original structure, if you will, of Jujitsu and you were like,
[02:06:24] oh wait, there's more stuff underneath the hood here.
[02:06:27] So you just like, you know how you ever buy like a remote control car and be like, okay,
[02:06:31] cool.
[02:06:32] And you take it apart and you see the motor and you see how everything works.
[02:06:34] You're like, okay, you take the original structure of Jujitsu and then when you roll,
[02:06:38] you sort of take it apart.
[02:06:40] Like you do stuff that you're not supposed to do.
[02:06:41] You let them out.
[02:06:42] Just see what happens.
[02:06:43] See, let me take off this wheel.
[02:06:44] Is that reverse engineering?
[02:06:46] In a way.
[02:06:47] But more and more, it's like a, it's a form of experimentation.
[02:06:52] So it's like when you do that, you start to see little connections like, oh, this piece
[02:06:56] doesn't have to fit here.
[02:06:58] I dig it.
[02:06:59] It can fit like over here.
[02:07:00] I dig that.
[02:07:01] And the reason we're one of the days that you're teaching and I figured that out is you did
[02:07:04] this drill that I never been a part of before.
[02:07:06] You're like, okay, get into whatever position mount, right?
[02:07:11] And then you'll just call out another position or submission and you'll be like, get there
[02:07:14] as quick as you can.
[02:07:15] And some people would be like, Oh, I got to go here.
[02:07:18] Some people, they don't even know how to get there.
[02:07:19] They'll just sort of climb over and for which won't really work, but it's part of the drill.
[02:07:25] You know, find the shortest path.
[02:07:27] I was just going to say, you're right.
[02:07:28] Find the shortest path.
[02:07:29] But there's a test as a test to see who stumbles through that one and just, you know, makes
[02:07:35] the 15 moves that could have been too.
[02:07:37] But I felt it though, because when you were like, Oh yeah, I'm out.
[02:07:41] We're in mount.
[02:07:42] And you said, go to the kneebar.
[02:07:43] And I was like, I know the drill, so I'm not just going to just go to the kneebar.
[02:07:47] Like the way you kind of can't really do it.
[02:07:49] I got to go to another step first.
[02:07:51] It's like, okay, I go half guard then the knee bar from, you know, Dean's knee bar or
[02:07:55] whatever.
[02:07:56] And I remember you watching and being like kind of looking as if just a little bit disgusting.
[02:08:01] No, no, no.
[02:08:02] The opposite.
[02:08:03] It was kind of approved.
[02:08:04] And not to say that that was such a great performance of the drill.
[02:08:07] It was more like, this is how I felt.
[02:08:09] I don't know.
[02:08:10] I couldn't read his mind.
[02:08:11] I just read his look where it was like.
[02:08:13] The way I felt at that time was like, this is the purpose of this drill is to like, don't
[02:08:17] think of it in terms of like, Oh, I know what an armbar is.
[02:08:20] Let me just go there.
[02:08:21] It's more like, figure out the quickest way and you'll probably figure out that there's
[02:08:26] quicker ways than how you do it when you really roll.
[02:08:29] Or there's actually ways to get there, even though it doesn't seem right there available
[02:08:34] at the time.
[02:08:35] It seems sane.
[02:08:36] And then I started thinking back and not to say I did this all in one day or nothing
[02:08:38] like that.
[02:08:39] But when you think back to like a lot of your stuff, like you'll do a darts choke choke
[02:08:44] when they're passing your guard.
[02:08:46] And I'm like, Oh, that's not usually where they teach the darts choke.
[02:08:49] Is it?
[02:08:50] It's usually from a very specific, you know, number of positions.
[02:08:53] And then if you look like his match against, um, this was in 2009.
[02:08:58] It was you went against Joel first and then Bill the girl Cooper.
[02:09:01] I forget who you went with first.
[02:09:03] It was like one of the first.
[02:09:04] No Martinez.
[02:09:05] I think that was the day to.
[02:09:07] Darts choke that guy, you know him, he's a good dude, but it was a random tournament
[02:09:11] in Delmar.
[02:09:12] Yeah.
[02:09:13] And that was the first time I think I've seen you in real life and I was watching you do
[02:09:17] stuff.
[02:09:18] I was like, wait, he's like doing a lot of creative stuff.
[02:09:21] Yeah, it's creative, but it's like you're violating a bunch of rules just so you can
[02:09:25] implement something that works by the way.
[02:09:28] And then when it's a good demonstration, the best demonstration of that, that I remember
[02:09:32] is you against bill the girl when you guys were both doing it.
[02:09:35] God.
[02:09:36] And we closed out several pro events where we were like in the finals against each other.
[02:09:41] Yeah.
[02:09:42] And he's like, this is my little brother, you know, we would just like, let's, let's
[02:09:45] put on a dope show.
[02:09:46] Yes, it's going to be a fixed match, but it's going to be so cool that people don't mind
[02:09:50] watching a fixed.
[02:09:51] Oh yeah.
[02:09:52] It was, yeah, it was crazy.
[02:09:53] It was really.
[02:09:54] Yeah, just like, uh, it's like why I talk about like musicians and how a musician that's
[02:09:58] really like Jimmy Page, you know, he played like as a studio musician for, for decades,
[02:10:05] like as a, as like a teenager, he was playing as a studio musician, like play these exact
[02:10:09] notes at this exact time.
[02:10:10] And he's so got so disciplined and so good that when he got to Led Zeppelin, he's like,
[02:10:14] oh, watch this, I'm going to play a note here with a freaking violin thing, whatever
[02:10:19] that thing is called.
[02:10:20] And I'm going to start playing a guitar in a totally different way and it's going to
[02:10:23] work and it's going to sound awesome.
[02:10:25] That's to me.
[02:10:26] That's like Jeff Glover on the mats of justice.
[02:10:27] I got compared to Led Zeppelin.
[02:10:29] Yeah.
[02:10:30] Yeah, you did.
[02:10:31] Right on, fellas.
[02:10:34] You guys coming down.
[02:10:35] I'm looking forward to taking classes after dude.
[02:10:38] Yeah, that's all I got.
[02:10:39] Yeah.
[02:10:40] Thanks, fellas.
[02:10:41] Thank you boys.
[02:10:42] We out.
[02:10:44] And with that, Jeff Glover and Pete, the Greek have left the building.
[02:10:50] Little jujitsu talk today.
[02:10:51] Yeah.
[02:10:52] Uh, you know, for me, from my perspective, it was kind of interesting to be like last
[02:10:59] night thinking I was going to do this podcast talking about jujitsu with Jeffy and Pete.
[02:11:05] And it was kind of, it's kind of, it's a lot different, right?
[02:11:09] A lot of times I'm reading from a book or I'm, you know, we're talking to someone that's
[02:11:14] been through some horrific things and it's usually pretty heavy, emotionally heavy.
[02:11:23] So it was kind of, I must say, it was kind of relaxing to come in and just be like, oh,
[02:11:29] we're going to talk about jujitsu with, with Jeff and Pete, who are both, you know, like
[02:11:34] nice and chill.
[02:11:36] So there you go.
[02:11:38] Uh, jujitsu jujitsu.
[02:11:40] So my, I came in this jujitsu scene in 2005 and which was in kind of the beginning of
[02:11:47] the height of ju, of Jeff Glover.
[02:11:51] So I saw Bill the grill, Jeff Glover, like these guys or whatever.
[02:11:55] So it is interesting to hear like his version of that timeline.
[02:11:59] And so I was like, Oh, that's when, that's when I came on the scene grapplers quest,
[02:12:03] best of the West, freaking the world submission grappling championships.
[02:12:10] It was like grapplers quest.
[02:12:12] You were a little behind when there used to be, God, there used to be some really interesting
[02:12:18] tournaments, good tournaments.
[02:12:20] But yeah, sounds like there's a, there's a series of tournaments that the tournaments
[02:12:23] you're talking came after.
[02:12:26] There was like, what was that one, like the Olympics of grappling or something like this
[02:12:32] grappling games.
[02:12:34] So I think that one faded by the time there was a place in LA called neutral grounds.
[02:12:40] That was old school back in the day.
[02:12:42] I mean, we're talking like there'd be 50 people there in a cage, like with a grappling matches,
[02:12:46] we're in a cage.
[02:12:49] Dean Lister had a tournament or a match against a guy there and Dean got him in some kind
[02:12:54] of hold, some kind of choke hold, but like, Oh no, Rico Rodriguez got this guy, but the
[02:13:01] guy didn't tap.
[02:13:03] And he like, when the ref stopped it or whatever, the dude like didn't get up for a while.
[02:13:09] Like they were thinking this guy might not be alive.
[02:13:12] Yeah, there were some crazy stuff, but a little bit rogue back in those days.
[02:13:18] Yeah.
[02:13:19] It's crazy how different it is now.
[02:13:21] It is the popularity of Jiu Jitsu is awesome to see and Jiu Jitsu is fun.
[02:13:28] And that the way that Jeff Glover rolls makes it even more fun watching him roll.
[02:13:32] Yeah.
[02:13:33] Get fun.
[02:13:34] Yeah.
[02:13:35] He's like the ideal of like exploratory to do and then what you gain like when you are
[02:13:42] I mean, him as the example, like what he has gained from exploring Jiu Jitsu in that way.
[02:13:47] So much is that's what makes it so like, you're not used to that kind of stuff.
[02:13:53] And so it comes off as so amazing and it's available to most people like that, but it's
[02:13:58] hard to like get in that mindset because he does it straight up during competitions.
[02:14:03] Like watch like MetaMorris.
[02:14:05] I think it was like four secret match.
[02:14:07] Oh yeah.
[02:14:08] He's the announcer, by the way, you know, like a secret match and it's Barry Yoshida,
[02:14:12] who just wasn't the hall of fame of ADCC, by the way.
[02:14:16] Barry Yoshida versus somebody.
[02:14:17] It's a secret, right?
[02:14:18] It's like a surprise.
[02:14:19] And they're like, Jeff Glover, the announcer gets off, takes off his suit and goes rolls.
[02:14:25] And boom, exploratory Jiu Jitsu, Donkey Guard, all this unorthodox stuff, but it's like,
[02:14:31] it's by design, you know?
[02:14:33] And it's interesting too, because they're like, they live kind of for lack of a better
[02:14:37] term like a Jiu Jitsu nomad style, right?
[02:14:39] Where they go around, everyone knows them.
[02:14:41] They know everybody.
[02:14:42] Is that Kang and Kung Fu walking the earth?
[02:14:46] It's crazy that for like five years, I have victory MMA and fitness.
[02:14:52] Look, we have Dean Lister teaching, like, which is insane just to think you can learn
[02:14:56] all this stuff from Dean Lisch.
[02:14:59] But for five years, we had Dean Lisch, which is as good as it's going to get.
[02:15:03] And Jeff Glover, they're both here.
[02:15:06] It was crazy.
[02:15:07] It was like every day was just, it was crazy.
[02:15:10] It was epic.
[02:15:12] Sometimes I rolled with Jeff and I've rolled in many, many times.
[02:15:16] And so the thing I remember about, or the thing that makes this very memorable is this
[02:15:21] was the whole day I rolled with him.
[02:15:22] I got a bunch of times where we're rolling, he's being all, he's keeping it playful or
[02:15:27] whatever.
[02:15:28] And then he switched and kept it real.
[02:15:31] Cause if you didn't know, there's two, two modes, keeping it playful and keeping it real.
[02:15:35] That's Hannah and he don't grace me up those terms, by the way.
[02:15:37] He, he, he switches over to keeping it real and bust out some wrestling on me.
[02:15:42] And I don't mean on me cause I'm so good.
[02:15:44] And so that's why I'm not saying that I'm saying because I outweighed him by a lot and
[02:15:48] he just put it on me.
[02:15:50] Another notable thing is earlier.
[02:15:53] Okay.
[02:15:54] So I like Kimura, especially on smaller guys.
[02:15:57] He saw the Kimura coming.
[02:15:59] He gave me the Kimura and he reached behind his back and just held his arms as if to be
[02:16:03] like, I'm giving you this Kimura, but it's your job to finish it.
[02:16:06] I couldn't finish it.
[02:16:07] I was like, bro, see that's the, and it's not like I'm smaller than him where it's like
[02:16:11] I'm bigger.
[02:16:12] Like the, the, the chance of me finishing it is going to be higher than, you know, maybe
[02:16:15] a smaller guy still does it, but that's that exploratory process that's going to allow
[02:16:20] him to understand all his available maneuver maneuvers.
[02:16:23] When your hand is already behind your back.
[02:16:26] He has that, we talked about it, but that level of confidence, like an insane level
[02:16:29] of confidence in duty.
[02:16:30] You know, when you watch Dean Lister with footlocks, he has that specifically with
[02:16:35] footlocks at hill.
[02:16:36] There's been tournaments where Dean would like stick his feet out like, go ahead, please
[02:16:40] try and footlock me.
[02:16:41] But man to Glover has that from a positional attitude.
[02:16:46] Like he doesn't care what position someone gets.
[02:16:49] He's going to.
[02:16:50] So awesome stuff.
[02:16:53] Thanks for those guys for coming on.

[02:17:01] We can't even start to, you can't even start to explain how much Jiu-Jitsu is going to
[02:17:05] help you in your life.
[02:17:07] You got to, you got to, you got to say, listen, I, you got to have faith in what we're saying.
[02:17:12] Right.
[02:17:13] Cause I can't explain it.
[02:17:14] Echo can't explain it.
[02:17:16] You got to have a little bit of faith just to go try it.
[02:17:18] And my recommendation is you do Jiu-Jitsu until you submit someone.
[02:17:22] That's the, I made that, I did make that up.
[02:17:24] I'll take credit for it.
[02:17:26] You do Jiu-Jitsu until you submit someone.
[02:17:28] Once you submit someone, if you decide, oh, I don't like this, did you move on?
[02:17:31] That's probably not going to happen.
[02:17:32] Cause once you submit somebody, you're like, it's like a drug.
[02:17:36] Yeah.
[02:17:37] Right.
[02:17:38] And you know what else is like a drug if you have the right attitude is getting submitted
[02:17:41] is like, damn, how'd that happen?
[02:17:43] How'd that happen?
[02:17:44] You know, it's a, it can be a horrible thing.
[02:17:47] But start training Jiu-Jitsu.

[02:20:20] the critical part of this.
[02:20:21] Because there's companies out there right now
[02:20:23] that are gonna try to sell you something.
[02:20:24] They got a brand, right?
[02:20:26] They got a brand.
[02:20:27] Making a brand.
[02:20:28] Oh, our brand is whatever.
[02:20:30] And what they do is they come up with some ideas
[02:20:32] and they design it and there's four people working there,
[02:20:34] seven people working there.
[02:20:36] And you know what?
[02:20:37] They design it and then they order it from China.
[02:20:42] And then over in a sweatshop,
[02:20:43] some slave labor makes it, sends it to here.
[02:20:46] They sell it and they keep that money and they go,
[02:20:50] cool, we made money.
[02:20:51] Let's do it again.
[02:20:52] That's not what we're doing.
[02:20:53] We're making it in America.
[02:20:55] So we do design it.
[02:20:57] But then we bring the designs to the factory.
[02:21:00] Our factories here in Maine and North Carolina
[02:21:04] and we make it.
[02:21:05] Americans make this stuff.
[02:21:09] And you'd think all it must be seven times more expensive
[02:21:12] than the slave labor.

[02:24:49] As for us, and by us, I mean Echo, Charles and myself,
[02:24:53] we're also on the interwebs.
[02:24:57] We're on Twitter.
[02:24:58] I've been getting a little bit back into Twitter
[02:25:00] since it seems like it might be picked up by Elon Musk,
[02:25:05] who may or may be probably going to do a better job
[02:25:07] of not censoring people,
[02:25:09] which makes you kind of question the whole gig.
[02:25:13] So Twitter, the Graham, Facebook,
[02:25:17] we're on there, Echoes at Echo, Charles,
[02:25:18] I'm at Jocko'willing.
[02:25:20] Of course, you got to watch out for that algorithm,
[02:25:23] because it will catch you.
[02:25:24] And the reason I know it'll catch you
[02:25:26] is because what I cheat when I go in my ice bath,
[02:25:31] kind of cheat when I go in my ice bath,
[02:25:33] I will look at the Instagram or some social media
[02:25:38] when I'm in there and time just goes by.
[02:25:40] You're like, oh, it's been six minutes,
[02:25:41] how did that happen?
[02:25:42] Oh, because my brain was captured.
[02:25:43] Yeah, yeah, sedated.
[02:25:45] So that's a good rule of thumb.
[02:25:47] You can only look at social media
[02:25:50] when you're in some uncomfortable scenario,
[02:25:52] but get into a wall squat.
[02:25:55] And as long as you can hold it, you can scroll.
[02:25:57] Yeah.
[02:25:58] You know, you get seven minutes, cool.
[02:25:59] You know what I'm saying?
[02:26:01] Go, could you hang off a pull-up bar?
[02:26:04] No, because you need your hand to scroll.
[02:26:05] Maybe you could.
[02:26:06] What other, what's another crappy position to get in?
[02:26:09] Ice bath for sure.
[02:26:11] Talking to you.
[02:26:12] Ice bath, yeah, you could sit there
[02:26:13] and have to talk to me.
[02:26:15] You a little frustrated today?
[02:26:17] What was the frustration about?
[02:26:19] I wasn't frustrated today.
[02:26:20] No, no, no, I can tell.
[02:26:20] That was yesterday.
[02:26:21] No, you were roid raging.
[02:26:22] I wasn't roid raging today, that was yesterday.
[02:26:24] Hoi.
[02:26:26] Cause you took it upon yourself to interrupt me
[02:26:28] in the morning, by the way.
[02:26:29] In the middle of my workout with some nonsense.
[02:26:33] But you responded during a workout.
[02:26:37] Yeah, that's true.
[02:26:37] Is that a good move you think?
[02:26:38] No, no, I know now, yeah, no.
[02:26:41] Bad move, terrible.
[02:26:42] What was the trigger statement that I made?
[02:26:45] No, no, I'd have to go through the thread,
[02:26:47] but there, cause there was a few.
[02:26:52] Multiple.
[02:26:53] So I made multiple comments that I did.
[02:26:55] Multiple, well, yeah, it's true, true story.
[02:26:57] Then you have to come here and sit here
[02:26:58] and talk to me for a long period of time.
[02:27:01] So I should have been scrolling social media
[02:27:03] during that time.
[02:27:05] It's mental anguish.
[02:27:06] Yep.
[02:27:07] Ha ha, check.
[02:27:10] All right, well, watch out for that algorithm
[02:27:12] unless I'm verbally abusing you,
[02:27:15] then it could be a nice little escape.
[02:27:16] See, that's what you need.
[02:27:17] You need a little escape from my abusive personality,
[02:27:21] you know, apparently.
[02:27:22] The world makes sense.
[02:27:24] You're going to train after this?
[02:27:25] I don't know, 50, 50.
[02:27:27] I have another engagement that I have.
[02:27:31] You knew we were doing this today.
[02:27:32] Yeah, I have my clothes, everything.
[02:27:33] Okay.
[02:27:35] All right.
[02:27:35] Okay, well, hey, that's on, you know,
[02:27:38] that's on the world, you know?
[02:27:39] Guess it's not your fault.
[02:27:41] See your whole tone right now.
[02:27:42] Yeah, see, that's what that's it.
[02:27:43] This is part of what I'm talking about.
[02:27:44] That's the abusive.
[02:27:45] It's part of it.
[02:27:46] It's part of it, yeah, it is, yes.
[02:27:48] Check.
[02:27:48] All right, well, once again,
[02:27:51] thanks to Jeff and Pete for coming down.
[02:27:52] Thanks for what you guys have done for Jiu-Jitsu.

[02:28:06] And I also want to thank our service members
[02:28:08] from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard.

[02:28:24] and actually you should make a chance,
[02:28:25] go find a way to train Jiu-Jitsu.
