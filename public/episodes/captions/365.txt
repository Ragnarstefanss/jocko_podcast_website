[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 365 with echo Charles and me jockel willing. Good evening echo. Good evening
[00:00:06] Also joining us tonight Dave Burke. Good evening Dave. Good evening
[00:00:10] All of you here this evening are leaders. I am pleased to meet you
[00:00:15] What you do may well dignify the past
[00:00:20] explain today and
[00:00:22] Secure for all of us
[00:00:24] tomorrow
[00:00:26] That's a little excerpt from a speech that was given and
[00:00:35] Was captured and transcript from general of the army by the way
[00:00:42] General the army Omar Bradley
[00:00:44] Who Dave and I well, I mean the Bradley fighting vehicle?
[00:00:49] We we are very fond of the Bradley fighting vehicle. So Omar Bradley
[00:00:53] We're gonna dig in this document, but a little bit about him
[00:00:56] born in a
[00:00:59] Little farming town in Clark, Missouri
[00:01:04] February 12th 1893
[00:01:07] Wicked poor parents very poor, but he got into West Point
[00:01:12] Went into West Point graduated in 1915
[00:01:16] Number 44 out of 164. It's only 164 people going to go into West Point in a class
[00:01:24] You know now it's like but I think it's about a thousand a class now
[00:01:28] So he graduated with that class of 1915 in which by the way, this is interesting this class the Eisenhower was in that class
[00:01:34] But 56 people in that class became generals
[00:01:39] One class of 164 people
[00:01:41] Became generals so they call that class the class that the stars fell on World War one
[00:01:48] He was in an infantry regiment, but he never left America. So didn't do anything
[00:01:54] So that's rough
[00:01:56] That was that's that's hard happen to some guys in the teams. They missed Vietnam and
[00:02:02] They were in the teams and there's nothing going on and then they got out of the teams September 11th happens. It's like a
[00:02:08] a bad deal a bad deal
[00:02:12] So he's in World War one happens. He just never leaves America in between
[00:02:17] the wars he's
[00:02:20] Going to you know various assignments spends a bunch of time as a student or a teacher at military schools makes Brigadier General in
[00:02:28] 1941
[00:02:30] 1942 to 1943 commands the 82nd and 28th Infantry Divisions March 1943
[00:02:38] March 1943
[00:02:40] He is requested by Eisenhower to go to North Africa and this is when he becomes the deputy commander
[00:02:48] Under patent which gets represented in the movie patent
[00:02:53] To core
[00:02:54] After that he's selected as the army group commander for D-Day for operation overlord D-Day and in D-Day
[00:03:01] He's on the ground
[00:03:03] Leading the fight through the the hedgerows of Normandy and then after the battle of St. Low
[00:03:09] August 1st. He takes command of the 12th Army Group and to the war. He's now a full general and
[00:03:14] By the way, check this out full general. He's in charge of overall in charge of 43 divisions
[00:03:25] 1.3 million
[00:03:27] I think that's the largest army that has ever been assembled in America
[00:03:32] 1945 comes back after war. He becomes the administrator for the for the Bureau of Veteran Affairs
[00:03:39] Gets on with that job 1948 back to the army
[00:03:45] 1949 first chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[00:03:48] So that's kind of a landmark role
[00:03:52] First chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 1950 of course Korea War starts in June in September
[00:03:57] He gets promoted to general of the army five-star. He's the fifth five-star general and the last five-star general we've had in America
[00:04:04] Army grows from 1950 to 1952 the whole army grows from 1.5 1.4 million troops to
[00:04:13] 3.5 million troops
[00:04:17] Didn't really have a great relationship with MacArthur and I should say MacArthur didn't have a great relationship with him
[00:04:25] kind of convinces Truman to get rid of to fire General MacArthur and
[00:04:28] I I tried to figure out exactly what this meant. I read several different sources about this
[00:04:34] So he he stopped active service in
[00:04:39] 1953 but he stayed on active duty. I guess it's because you're a five-star general you're like permanent like you're not going anywhere
[00:04:46] so
[00:04:47] He's still active duty
[00:04:49] Even though he's not maybe in the exact position, but he's still on active duty
[00:04:53] And then he just like chairs a bunch of you know chairs the the Commission on Veterans Pensions
[00:05:00] Member of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board
[00:05:04] His chairman of the board of below the watch. How do you say below the watch company below the below the below the say yeah
[00:05:10] Or but I've heard below but the boat. Okay. I don't know how to say it
[00:05:14] American company. Did you know that? No, I always thought it was a foreign company. No, it was American company
[00:05:18] Not made in America anymore. Unfortunately
[00:05:20] Um wrote a book called soldier story, which I'm sure we'll cover on here at some point
[00:05:25] He was a consultant in the movie
[00:05:29] Patent for the movie patent because of course Pat had died in what 1947
[00:05:33] Was even quicker. It's like 45 is like right after the war like the war was just barely over
[00:05:38] So Pat wasn't alive and and so he's a consultant on the movie patent and of course in the movie
[00:05:45] It shows them as kind of like
[00:05:47] Friends, you know close friends little different personalities
[00:05:52] But in reality they didn't get along apparently very well. He died April 8th
[00:05:58] 1981 so that means he was on active duty
[00:06:03] From August 1st 1911 when he when he went to the when he went to West Point until April 8th 1981
[00:06:11] He was on active duty for 69 years eight months and seven days
[00:06:15] Obviously a ton of experience and like I said, I'm sure at some point we'll cover that whole book on the podcast
[00:06:25] But I was reading this transcript the other day because he had visited the Carlisle barracks
[00:06:31] which is where the army war colleges and
[00:06:34] He had stopped by to talk to some students about leadership
[00:06:38] And he had some great insights there that I thought it'd be worth sitting down and covering
[00:06:44] So let's get into it
[00:06:48] Omar Bradley five-star general stopping by to talk to your class about leadership. What do you got?
[00:06:53] So he starts off like I said, I use already already all of you here this evening our leaders
[00:06:59] I'm pleased to meet you what you do may well dignify the past explain today and secure for all of us tomorrow
[00:07:05] So that's how we that's how we kind of kicks this thing off
[00:07:07] Then he says perhaps I can touch upon a few factors that will underscore the value of good leadership
[00:07:16] Leadership is intangible no weapon no impersonal piece of machinery ever designed can take its place
[00:07:23] Now he didn't have AI yet
[00:07:25] Right
[00:07:27] No, he did not he did not have AI. No AI is getting close man
[00:07:32] Have you seen the chat GBT? You know I'm talking about no, what is that?
[00:07:36] It's like this AI that's writing things for people. Oh, yeah, do you see the AI art?
[00:07:41] Yep, yeah, I try and now everyone's like doing their thing whatever
[00:07:44] But doesn't AI kind of defeat the whole purpose of art though
[00:07:47] Yeah, kind of and the other thing of that I've noticed about AI art people that have posted AI art of themselves
[00:07:53] Is it's basically the most completely like fantasized vision of yourself you could ever have?
[00:08:01] Like hey, it's it's me Jocko except for I
[00:08:05] You know just like a
[00:08:08] 270 pound shredded six foot five dude with like
[00:08:13] That's pretty much what it is. Yes, sir. Yeah, that's probably written into the AI like they probably like plump your lips
[00:08:20] Oh to get you to get you to like the picture and post it and spread it got it from red
[00:08:26] And that's how it what do you call one that AI takes over like info. That's how it like
[00:08:30] Disseminates right that's how it like freaking propagates itself. Yeah, so he's saying there's no machine that can take its place
[00:08:38] But I'll tell you what you can definitely make some incredible
[00:08:43] Calculations using artificial intelligence. I think you're always gonna have a little sanity check on things
[00:08:49] but
[00:08:51] according to Omar Bradley in
[00:08:54] 1971 which is when he made the speech they're never gonna be able to replace leadership
[00:08:58] He goes on to say this is the age of the computer you wasn't kidding
[00:09:03] And if you know how to program the machine you can get quick and accurate answers
[00:09:07] But how can you include leadership and morale which is affected by leadership into your programming?
[00:09:13] You actually can do some of that right?
[00:09:16] Some of it. Yeah, you have to be able to right? Yeah, fully
[00:09:21] Let us never forget the great importance of this element leadership and while we use computers for certain answers
[00:09:27] Let us not try to fight a whole war or even a single battle without giving proper consideration to the element of leadership
[00:09:36] I'm gonna concur with that
[00:09:38] Another element to be considered is the man to be led and with whose morale we are concerned I
[00:09:46] Am constantly reminded of this point by a cartoon which hangs over my desk at home
[00:09:52] Which depicts an infantryman with his rifle across his knees as he sits behind a parapet
[00:09:59] Above him is the list of the newest weapons science has devised and the soldier behind the parapet is saying
[00:10:06] But still they haven't found the substitute for me
[00:10:12] Now I'm gonna tell you they're getting closer. I
[00:10:15] Mean you Dave Burke you're all but replaced
[00:10:18] You've been beating the the the
[00:10:22] Aviation AI drum for a while. This is not like this. This is not like a new thing
[00:10:27] I you've been thinking about we've been talked we talked about this
[00:10:29] We have and I am of I still think of the minority mindset that we're one airplane away from
[00:10:34] No longer having man fighters. Wait, there's who thinks that we're do people think we're more than that. Yes, I think so
[00:10:41] Oh really? I think I
[00:10:43] Don't have any data to back this up other than just conversations. I think most people in aviation think we have more
[00:10:50] Man fighters to build. I think we have one more. I think it's not would not surprise me if we built one more
[00:10:56] One more past the F-35. Yes
[00:10:58] One more you think you're gonna need another manned aircraft past the F-35. No, I don't oh you don't I do not
[00:11:05] I'm telling you I would not be surprised if the next one that they're designing now is the last man fighter
[00:11:09] Okay, it would not it would not surprise me at all
[00:11:11] I think a lot of people would say no way
[00:11:14] The other the other interesting thing is there's a dynamic where you there's no reason to even have a
[00:11:20] Big aircraft like that, right? I mean you could just make smaller multiple smaller aircraft
[00:11:24] Yeah, there's a whole lot of things happening right now like I forgot what the terms
[00:11:28] But basically they're even looking at F-35 certainly the next iteration of fighters is I think they call it like the swarm
[00:11:35] Which is all these you know smaller?
[00:11:38] Drones or you know remote pilots that this lead pilot, you know when an actual aircraft might have a bunch of control over
[00:11:45] But the swarm is always unmanned aviation, you know centric vehicles working with that person
[00:11:50] the progress that they made with drones in like a few years was insane
[00:11:57] Yeah
[00:11:58] We had one we had these drones in task unit bruiser
[00:12:02] I think they were called Ravens and they were sort of like a big
[00:12:05] Model airplane, you know little radio controlled airplane and
[00:12:11] Like single prop and you had to throw them into the air and then you had to be a legit pilot to be able to fly them
[00:12:18] You'd be flying them around in circles around the target the pilots all sucked so they're like crashing them
[00:12:23] What was one of laze one of laze AOI's no one of laze AOI sees
[00:12:27] He begged me we had something he goes hey, can I use our our UAV for this? Can I launch the UAV and I was like all right?
[00:12:34] So we were on
[00:12:37] NAB Coronado, I think and he throws this thing to launch it and it no kidding goes like 80 yards and
[00:12:44] plows into a building just head-on right
[00:12:47] Totally good, and then the second time he's used it
[00:12:50] We're out at our our urban training and he like launched it and again imagine a little tiny
[00:12:56] Model airplane. It's got a crappy camera like this is before you know
[00:13:00] This is like worse than a blackberry camera in 2005 right?
[00:13:05] This is just junk. It's not like now where you and I like we're all sitting at this table
[00:13:09] We all have like how many megapixels are on our iPhone?
[00:13:13] Did blackberry have a camera yeah, it did yeah, cuz I have like a
[00:13:18] Folder that says blackberry pictures. So yeah, it exists, right?
[00:13:23] And they are low quality so anyways you got this knucklehead you got this crappy camera
[00:13:28] You got this knucklehead seal like that's
[00:13:31] Like no pilot by any stretch
[00:13:33] He probably went to a three-week school or something and he's flying around a target and
[00:13:37] Try and the camera is not like we take for granted now you can just lock a camera in position
[00:13:42] It's it's got a little geo stabilizer and all that stuff. This didn't have any day. It's like
[00:13:48] Absolutely awful. It was literally worthless. So he's he's tell me like you know hey boss
[00:13:53] I got this thing. I will go with the UAV. We'll get a look at the target. All right, bro
[00:13:56] So he launches it you can't see anything. We're waiting to launch. I go. Hey man. Just bring it back here
[00:14:01] We got to go he brings it back and he tries to land and it crashes right over our home V's square into a tree, bro
[00:14:09] Just totally destroyed so
[00:14:12] They've made massive progress. I think I don't I mean I think your your crew is definitely out of a job in
[00:14:19] Next fighter for sure
[00:14:22] Who's thinking you still need to be in there? I think a lot of people
[00:14:25] What what is it what if you were to argue their side? What would you say?
[00:14:28] I think the argument of their side is like all the nuance that goes in with real-time decision-making and
[00:14:34] The flexibility that goes along with that requires a human being to understand sort of the nature of the the the three-dimensional
[00:14:42] Unpredictability in the fog of wars you need a human being to be able to make decisions as opposed to a computer
[00:14:48] I'm not an expert on AI, but it is startling
[00:14:51] It and it's not just what it can do. I think your point is a more important point is
[00:14:56] How how steep that curve is and if you think about like if you think about 30 years and how much happens in 30 years?
[00:15:05] That's why I'm looking at it like alright
[00:15:06] We're gonna start designing this thing now like we'll build we'll buy it and we'll build it and like we'll fly it and then
[00:15:11] Like 30 or 40 years from now. We're gonna do it again
[00:15:13] and I'm like 40 years from now like
[00:15:16] If I think about how old I'm gonna be and how much is gonna happen in that 40 years or 30 40 years
[00:15:21] I think it's really hard to not at least envision
[00:15:26] It's it's gonna be dramatic how much different the world is and just the concept of even what AI means
[00:15:31] It's not like it's going through something where it can like cook food for you or draw a piece of art
[00:15:36] It's like doing level eye level thing that is well beyond anything you can comprehend and just visualizing
[00:15:42] It'd be like saying the to the right brothers. So like hey
[00:15:45] What you just flew an airplane? That's amazing in 40 years. We're gonna walk on the moon. Maybe like that doesn't compute
[00:15:51] They can't make the connection of like 40 years later. It'll be like the 50s and we're gonna start putting people in outer space
[00:15:59] So I think if you think about that like what's gonna happen in 30 40 years
[00:16:02] I think that curve is so freaking steep that it's hard not to visualize
[00:16:05] It's gonna be something way beyond all we can imagine and the idea of like me Dave Burke you needing me to do that is
[00:16:11] It's a little arrogant. I guess basically you think of it like hey, man, you know
[00:16:16] I I love to consider myself a smart guy, but give give the computers 35 years from now
[00:16:20] I think I think a lot is gonna change. There's a lot of things changing right now
[00:16:24] Yeah, there's a lot of things change right now the you know the battlefield in Ukraine right now
[00:16:29] The tanks are getting taken out at like a couple miles away
[00:16:34] With no, you know by a ground by a man-packed
[00:16:37] Munition that's a game changer that like all of a sudden in one
[00:16:43] Short period of time tanks are a little bit obsolete if you look at it from that perspective
[00:16:48] So things are changing. All right back to leadership here
[00:16:51] Of course with this particular group of service personnel
[00:16:54] I I am considering leadership as it applies to a military unit
[00:16:57] However, having been associated with industry for some time now
[00:17:00] I find it difficult to completely separate the principles of military and industrial leadership
[00:17:05] They have much in common so he agrees with us
[00:17:09] leadership is leadership in
[00:17:12] Selecting a company in which to invest our savings
[00:17:14] We often give primary consideration to the company with good leadership in a similar manner a military unit is often judged by its leadership
[00:17:22] Good leadership is essential to organized action where any group is involved the one who commands be he a military
[00:17:29] officer or captain of industry
[00:17:31] Must project power and energizing power which coordinates
[00:17:36] Coordinates and marshals the best efforts of his followers by supplying that certain something for which they look to him be a guidance
[00:17:44] support encouragement example or even new ideas and imagination
[00:17:52] So I
[00:17:54] Mean this is um
[00:17:56] This is what why the leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield, right? But it's so it's so interesting that this guy
[00:18:05] He's talking about these these like sucky this guy that spent his whole life in leadership
[00:18:10] Can't really put his finger on what he's talking about
[00:18:12] You know what I mean? He's like could be could be guidance could be support could be encouragement could be example could be new ideas
[00:18:19] That's a lots of wide range of stuff
[00:18:21] The test of a leader lies in the reaction and response of his followers now that's a good that's a good statement
[00:18:26] If your people aren't doing what you need him to do you're you're doing something wrong
[00:18:34] He should not have to impose authority
[00:18:37] Bossiness in itself never made a leader
[00:18:42] So there you go
[00:18:43] Which is also again for those of people that are up there with a stereotype that you're not doing anything wrong
[00:18:48] Which is also again for those of people that are up there with a stereotype of the military leader
[00:18:52] Here's this guy saying you should have to put impose your authority
[00:18:56] And you know we were at Gettysburg
[00:18:59] And I started talking about authority and like authority
[00:19:03] What the things people call on for authority rank?
[00:19:08] time in experience
[00:19:12] Knowledge technical knowledge like all those things people can call on that and use it as authority
[00:19:17] Like I've been doing this. Hey, I've been podcasting for three years, man
[00:19:21] You don't know what you're talking like that kind of thing. That's just a that's just an argument of authority
[00:19:26] So it goes beyond just rank
[00:19:30] Continue on he must make his influence felt by example and the instilling of confidence in his followers the greatness of a leader is
[00:19:38] measured by the achievements of the lead
[00:19:40] This is the ultimate test of his effectiveness
[00:19:47] Chuck I'm on board of that
[00:19:49] Yeah, and and listen, I'll make this comment now so I'm gonna have to come back to it like that comments
[00:19:54] I would say a timeless comment
[00:19:56] Your achievement as a leader is based on what your people accomplish
[00:19:59] If you've listened to what I said five minutes ago and like oh, I'm just gonna outsource my leadership to a computer down the road
[00:20:05] That's not a good plan the attributes that the the behaviors of good leadership
[00:20:10] Regardless of what computers might be able to do in the future
[00:20:12] The most important thing you could ever possibly do is make you and the people around you better leaders
[00:20:16] So don't get all wrapped up on this AI is gonna solve your problems
[00:20:20] I don't know when it will if it ever will but between now and then learning how to be a good leader is a really good use of your time
[00:20:26] Well, it's the most important thing
[00:20:29] Nothing nothing that you can do as an individual human can ever compete with what you can do with a team
[00:20:33] That's it. Yeah
[00:20:37] Too frequently we use the words leader and commander
[00:20:40] synonymously
[00:20:41] We should not forget that there are far more staff officer assignments than there are command billets and a good staff officer
[00:20:49] Can and should display the same leadership as a commander while it takes a good staff officer to initiate an effective plan
[00:20:56] It requires a leader to ensure that the plan is properly executed
[00:21:01] That is why you and I have been taught that the work of collecting information
[00:21:06] Studying it drawing a plan making a decision is 10% of the job and seeing that the plan seeing the plan through is the other
[00:21:14] 90% a well-trained officer is one who could serve effectively either as a staff officer or as a commander
[00:21:22] You know, this is the the conversation that you and I have we've had it at the muster a few times because
[00:21:28] When and I wrote about it in extreme ownership
[00:21:34] with Seth stone and
[00:21:36] writing on his
[00:21:38] Writing on his Humvee window
[00:21:41] Relax, here's what you do when you start getting shot at bro one relax to look around three make a call
[00:21:46] And then you and I had a conversation about about it
[00:21:49] And you were lining it up with the oodaloop and the last thing in the in the oodaloop is
[00:21:53] Act after you decide you act and they didn't quite line up because I didn't
[00:21:59] Say execute or act when I put that thing on Seth stones board on his window
[00:22:04] And the reason I didn't have to say that is because his platoon was like ready to do whatever the hell he said to do
[00:22:08] Right, they weren't having a problem with execution. He was just having a problem with decide
[00:22:13] You were only solving the parts that he wasn't doing so you need to add a component that was already happening with that guy
[00:22:18] Yeah, and that's what this is
[00:22:20] It's getting people to actually do things. That's what he's saying is 90% of the job
[00:22:27] sitting there and coming up with a plan is
[00:22:30] Okay, I mean it's you know, there's there's some small challenges to come up with a plan, but not really I mean
[00:22:36] If you have time to plan then you have time to assess different angles and look at things and come up and try different little courses of
[00:22:41] Actions and run through some war games some some possibilities and then you got a plan you're good
[00:22:45] But getting people to actually execute that thing that's what's a challenge. That's where things fall apart by the way
[00:22:53] That's where dreams die
[00:22:56] I'm gonna tell you that right now
[00:22:58] dreams die in
[00:23:01] Execution they don't the dream comes out man. The dream flourishes in someone's mind, right?
[00:23:07] People go people live out the entire fantasy. They've the entire dream
[00:23:11] People live out like echo comes out up with an idea for a movie, right?
[00:23:18] He lives out the whole fantasy the Oscar awards like the whole thing the limo's like the red carpet
[00:23:23] He's got that whole thing
[00:23:25] But guess what he fails on execution, right? Like it's like oh, but now I got to work
[00:23:30] But now I got to take and I got to do this thing
[00:23:33] So dreams die in that in that space
[00:23:36] Between decide and act that's where dreams die between idea and execution. That's where dreams die and that's why a
[00:23:44] Leader's a leader's job is to make that execution happen and here's the thing
[00:23:50] There's another thing said Cess don't we got interviewed about the battle of Ramadi and and
[00:23:55] Seth told the interviewer that I had to like beat
[00:23:58] I had to beat my head against the wall for every operation that we were able to do which was an exaggeration
[00:24:03] But the fact the matter is and I would tell that story to the young officers like if you think you're gonna do a mission without
[00:24:10] Like making that mission happen. You're not going to be able to you know, it's almost it's very rare that you're gonna be able to
[00:24:18] That that an operation you come up with a plan and it and like okay
[00:24:21] I said it in motion and now it's just gonna happen. No, you have to like fight every step of the way and that's the way it is in business
[00:24:25] That's the way it is in life
[00:24:27] Yeah, I I'm picturing trying to convince other people that that you need to be on board with when you've come up with a plan
[00:24:37] Knowing that they're gonna have to be on board with that plan and when when he says you're gonna beat your head against the wall
[00:24:43] I think like you said your point is just the amount of sheer work that it takes
[00:24:47] You don't just like hey you guys and they're like cool and it just happens
[00:24:50] It's all the other people and all the things they have to do and where leadership comes in on that just to convince people
[00:24:56] And I hate to say it there are times that are people out there that just want to say no
[00:25:00] they just want to say no to your plan and
[00:25:04] You especially if there's rank involved you can't just tell those people what did you get a lead your way around those things and there's so much
[00:25:09] harder than sometimes people give credit for and
[00:25:12] How often I'll see people run into a barrier and then stop and and give up that until I literally wrote down dreams that execution
[00:25:20] I mean, it's kind of funny when you say it
[00:25:22] But that's the hardest part not the I could sit at my desk and I would do this all the time in Ramadi had these ideas like hey
[00:25:27] We're gonna do this. We're gonna go here. We're gonna make all these things happen
[00:25:31] And then reality is in there and the hardest part about there that is the people you have to get on board to making this stuff happen
[00:25:36] Not your people going ready to go execute
[00:25:38] But all the things that get in the way of to the point where you can go execute that plan
[00:25:42] Yeah, you ever heard the term idea guy and I he's not you guys, you know, which is a bummer
[00:25:48] It's it's what and this is this is a huge dichotomy is that
[00:25:55] For me like okay, let's say I'm right a book. Let's say I'm right way of the warrior kid
[00:25:59] The idea is the is by far the hardest part of that. It is so hard to come up with an idea like that's viable and good
[00:26:09] It well I can't even say it's hard work. It's almost like it's almost like life
[00:26:15] It's almost like a life
[00:26:17] It's almost like life like you can't you can't create life like hey a
[00:26:23] Scientist knows the various ingredients that are in a cell
[00:26:26] But they can't make it they can't mix them together make it come to life, right as tenacious D said you can't manufacture in
[00:26:34] Spirado so so it's it's this dichotomy because the hardest thing you could do like write a hit song
[00:26:41] Right. Oh my gosh, like everybody knows what chords it is
[00:26:45] Like there's four chords five chords that you're gonna be using whatever and yet
[00:26:50] Jack White is writing hit song after hit song after hit song coming out
[00:26:54] He's he's bringing them out of thin air, right?
[00:26:57] And yet someone else is spending their entire life trying and they can't make it happen
[00:27:03] So it's weird that you can have because I kind of wrote down a note. I was like ideas have no value
[00:27:09] Because ideas by themselves have no value they have no value
[00:27:12] And you have a riff in your head or you got an idea for some new component or whatever
[00:27:17] If it's just an idea man, it has no value and that's proven out in the fact that if you go and find investors for your idea
[00:27:23] They're gonna buy your idea for pennies on the dollar
[00:27:25] You're gonna own like a little tiny piece of it if you're lucky if you are if now if you are able to hang on to the idea
[00:27:31] And you're able to execute you could end up being you know
[00:27:34] Peter teal or Elon Musk that came up with the idea of PayPal and held on to it for long enough that okay here we go
[00:27:44] so
[00:27:45] Have you got anything got it you think it's like it's like a it's a war man
[00:27:50] It's a war the whole thing from the idea that you come up with that's great to the executioner and by the way if you're an idea guy
[00:27:57] and
[00:27:58] Your stubborn
[00:28:00] The don't be so I'm gonna I'm gonna give you some advice don't be stubborn find somebody that's an execution guy and be like
[00:28:06] Hey, dude, I got a really good idea
[00:28:07] Do you want to help me execute this thing and there's all kinds of different people out there and
[00:28:12] Some people idea people and some people are execution people and you got to work with these other people to get things to move very few people
[00:28:18] Are gonna come up with an idea
[00:28:21] Execute the idea properly with the right logistics to make this thing work. That's why you build a team
[00:28:26] So I was a radio man in the day was back in the day
[00:28:31] So I was a radio man
[00:28:32] So which man I was always on the field and I had a little flashlight with me right a little red lens flashlight
[00:28:36] And I would tape it up
[00:28:37] So it'd be really really dim because a little bit of light goes a long way and you just need to look at your your
[00:28:42] Radio in the dark and you got a turn on your little flashlight
[00:28:45] but you know you have a batteries and
[00:28:49] They wear out and you know where it gets left to like all those all kinds of problems and it's big
[00:28:53] And I remember one day I was in a helicopter
[00:28:58] And I'm looking at the pilot and the pilot's reading his map and he's got a lip light, you know, this is day
[00:29:03] I'm sure you do. Yeah, right. It's like so where they where they're headset, you know where the radio comes out
[00:29:09] There was a little cool. How did you turn it on?
[00:29:11] I think like either like your tongue or something like whatever the
[00:29:15] magnet electro or I'm Donald Blight but like
[00:29:17] You're your contact with it illuminated the light and what if you bite down on her or to close your eyes or something
[00:29:25] So but all it was was an LED a little dim LED light that you could see and
[00:29:31] It's like LED like every light in my house right now is an LED light
[00:29:35] But I but I didn't think oh I should make a flashlight a little tiny tiny flashlights like that because you had
[00:29:42] You wouldn't have looked at remember when you were kidding you had some kind of a toy that was lit up with an LED light
[00:29:47] It's like any random toy. They had little LED lights
[00:29:50] Those are bright enough to be a flashlight and I was a radio man and I didn't put two and two together and
[00:29:57] By the time when Iraq the Iraq war started someone else came out with little LED flashlights and now that's all they're gonna use
[00:30:03] This period so there's a classic example
[00:30:06] I'm I didn't that idea is worth probably hundreds and hundreds of millions probably worth billions of dollars now of
[00:30:11] LED flashlights
[00:30:13] It was right in front of you is dancing around. I didn't see it
[00:30:15] So that that idea would have had it unlimited value to me if I could have executed, but I couldn't I didn't know it
[00:30:22] I just didn't know it so
[00:30:25] That's why the idea has limitless value, but at the same time if you don't execute some no value at all
[00:30:31] That's the kind of the same as Bluetooth remember cuz when Bluetooth came out, right? It was like
[00:30:37] Just the earpiece. It's like that's Bluetooth now like everything is good to the truth
[00:30:42] It's like no wire. There's no wire anymore necessary and Bluetooth owns like Bluetooth
[00:30:48] They own that stuff so they're getting yeah, yeah
[00:30:50] Imagine getting paid on every set of head of Bluetooth headphones now and every to speaker and boot. Yeah
[00:30:57] So there's a good one
[00:31:00] Little technology activity. All right
[00:31:02] I'm back to the book here. I can recall a former vice president of one of the companies with which I'm associated
[00:31:07] He would formulate some good plans, but never followed up to see it as plans got expected results. I
[00:31:12] Knew he had served in World War two so out of curiosity
[00:31:16] I looked into the nature of the service and found that his entire period of service was a staff officer
[00:31:21] He had never had the advantage of a command job. So his training was incomplete
[00:31:26] Maybe if he'd remained in the service longer, we could have deployed
[00:31:29] He'd developed his leadership qualities as well and this man would still be with the company that you got fired
[00:31:37] So there you go
[00:31:39] Couldn't execute good coming up with plans just couldn't get him executed. You may have heard the story about general perzing World War one
[00:31:46] While inspecting a certain area he found a project that was not going too well
[00:31:50] Even though the second lieutenant in charge seemed to have a pretty good plan
[00:31:53] General perzing asked the lieutenant how much pay he received and when the lieutenant replied a hundred and forty one dollars and sixty seven per
[00:31:59] Months or general perzing said just remember that you get paid a dollar sixty seven for making your plan and issuing the order and a hundred and forty
[00:32:07] Dollars for seeing that gets carried out. I
[00:32:10] Think I heard that story about Paton too. I guess maybe Paton heard it from from purging I
[00:32:17] Am not sure that I would go to that extreme
[00:32:20] Certainly in these days problems are complex and good staff work plays a large part in resolving them
[00:32:25] I have known commanders who were not too smart
[00:32:28] But they were very knowledgeable about personnel and new enough to select the very best for their staffs
[00:32:34] Remember a good leader is one who causes or inspires others a staff or subordinate commanders to do the job
[00:32:40] Isn't that interesting word causes?
[00:32:43] Or inspires like it's just happening
[00:32:46] Furthermore no leader knows it all
[00:32:51] Although so you sometimes may find one who seems to think he does and that's coming from that's from the document
[00:32:57] Even he had a deal with people that thought they knew everything
[00:33:01] A leader should encourage the members of his staff to speak up if they think the commander is wrong
[00:33:07] He should give he should invite constructive considered criticism
[00:33:11] It is a grave error for the leader to surround himself with a yes staff. Oh
[00:33:17] See he developed this idea and I executed in the book leadership strategy and tactics don't be you know
[00:33:22] No, no yes, man, right? He's knowing this
[00:33:27] General George C. Marshall was an excellent excellent exponent of the principle of having subordinates speak up
[00:33:35] when he first became chief of staff of the army
[00:33:37] The secretariat of that office consisted of three officers who presented orally to General Marshall the staff papers or studies
[00:33:45] Coming from the divisions of the general staff. I was a member of the secretariat
[00:33:49] We presented in abbreviated form the contents of the staff studies citing the highlights of the problem involved the various possibilities course
[00:33:56] various possible courses of action considered and the action recommended at the end of his first week as chief of staff
[00:34:02] Marshall called us into his army
[00:34:05] Staff Marshall called us into his office and opened the discussion by saying I am disappointed in all of you
[00:34:12] When we inquired if we might ask why he said you haven't disagreed with a single thing I have done all week
[00:34:20] We told him it so happened that we were in full agreement with every paper that had been presented that we knew what he wanted
[00:34:26] And that we would add our comments to anything that we considered should be questioned
[00:34:30] The very next day we presented a paper as written and then expressed some thoughts which in our opinion
[00:34:38] Made the recommended action
[00:34:41] questionable
[00:34:42] General Marshall said now that is what I want unless I hear all the arguments against an action
[00:34:48] I am not sure whether I am right or not
[00:34:54] I was at FTX with us along front
[00:34:57] And I said something along the lines of and I actually wrote it down
[00:35:01] But it's something along the lines of if you don't get any pushback
[00:35:06] It's it's a warning
[00:35:09] So and that's his leader and it could be a warning for a bunch of different. It's a symptom for a bunch of different problems
[00:35:14] Like the primary one. Hey, maybe everyone's scared of to tell you what they actually think of your stupid plan
[00:35:21] Maybe you're hoarding information so they can't even assess whether a plan is accurate or not
[00:35:28] Maybe you've got them trained to a point where all they want to do is agree with you if you train your leaders
[00:35:35] Like you can do such a exquisite job training your leaders that you've replicated yourself
[00:35:41] And you don't want to replicate yourself
[00:35:45] You want to have people that have different perspectives. That's the goal
[00:35:48] Yeah, I wrote down
[00:35:50] You're going kind of going through that list of all the potential reasons why I know there's more but I wrote down
[00:35:55] We all see it the same way and how easy is to fall in the trap for like that's a good thing
[00:35:59] That's not a good thing
[00:36:00] We I don't want people and the whole point of the risk behind that is is we can have a great relationship
[00:36:06] You see the way I operate we get aligned we get fundamentally observing in the world the same way and that seems like such a good thing
[00:36:12] But it's not I actually want you to see it from a perspective from a perspective that I don't see him like hey dude
[00:36:19] You don't see what I'm seeing over here
[00:36:21] So when we talk about being aligned we want alignment on what our outcomes want to be and what the objective is
[00:36:28] But I don't want everybody seeing the problem the same way that I see the problem
[00:36:33] And you know even
[00:36:36] Checking out what we want our outcomes to be I've worked with clients before where I'm like well
[00:36:43] Why do you want to do that?
[00:36:45] I
[00:36:47] Remember was working with a client that was like what we want to grow by X percentage. I was like well, why do you want to do that?
[00:36:52] What's the reason well because because we want to grow okay?
[00:36:56] So what is it going to take to grow and you start like why do you want to do that?
[00:37:01] It's some some businesses they get into a good spot and look we are programmed now in the business world right?
[00:37:07] Program to hey growth
[00:37:10] growth is success and
[00:37:12] There's a lot of reality to that right there's a lot of reality to growth is success depending on the type of business
[00:37:19] but like you you get a small family business and
[00:37:21] And well they got you know husband and wife they got a good business going and they have a
[00:37:31] kid and
[00:37:33] They want to grow the business well
[00:37:35] You know what was that kid want to do? Does that kid want to take over the family business?
[00:37:40] Is do they want to keep this business at a sustainable rate where they can kind of?
[00:37:44] Continue on with their business and don't have to look you're getting oh you oh you go to uh?
[00:37:50] You go to Florida every every winter for three weeks
[00:37:54] When you're if you grow your business all of a sudden that Florida trip three weeks you can't do that anymore
[00:37:58] So you listen what are you trying to do?
[00:38:01] So even like where's our outcome you need to even question that and this is a great example
[00:38:06] You know we've gone through in the well with Vietnam
[00:38:09] with
[00:38:11] Iraq and Afghanistan, you know
[00:38:14] To what end?
[00:38:15] And I know Jamie just did on the woman's assemble. She taught she talked about to what end which is a book by Ward Justin and
[00:38:23] She took what I had talked about at the council at the council. I kind of opened up talking about
[00:38:29] To what end and this is what Ward just was all asking about the Vietnam War here
[00:38:35] We are we're spending billions of dollars. We're losing American lives
[00:38:41] We're killing a bunch of Vietnamese people
[00:38:44] To what end what are we trying to do here? And if you have that attitude in
[00:38:52] Every decision that you make, you know when echo wakes up in the morning goes down, you know to the donut shop
[00:38:58] In orders of donut like to what end are you doing this if you ask yourself that honestly to what end well?
[00:39:04] I know it's gonna taste good. Okay, but like where are you gonna be in a few years? Well, you know what actually I'm doing this right now
[00:39:10] I get it. I'm just gonna have this donut, but you know, I'm gonna do a hard workout later
[00:39:15] And I'm not gonna eat anything else sweet for the next, you know, couple days. Okay, so you have a plan
[00:39:20] But where people lose it is when they're not actually thinking about where they're trying to go
[00:39:26] That's a problem so ask yourself that question to what end and
[00:39:32] If your boss is telling you to do something
[00:39:35] Or your boss has come up with a plan or you're presenting a boss a plan to your boss
[00:39:39] And your boss doesn't agree with you. You might be you might not be aligned on where you're trying to go
[00:39:43] Well, wait a second
[00:39:45] Are we trying to grow the business? Okay. Well, what part of the business are we trying to grow?
[00:39:48] There's all kinds of questions to be asked here
[00:39:51] So pay attention to those things
[00:39:57] If you happen to be a detail if you happen to be detailed to a staff try to be a good staff officer
[00:40:03] And if possible avoid being a yes, man
[00:40:05] I would suggest to all commanders that they inform the members of their staffs that anyone who does not
[00:40:10] Disagree once in a while with what is about to be done is is of limited value and perhaps should be shifted to some other place
[00:40:17] Where he might occasionally have an idea
[00:40:19] So you got someone that never disagrees with you get rid of them. They're they're not helping you
[00:40:27] Of course, I am thinking about the decision-making process
[00:40:30] After decision is made everyone must be behind it a hundred percent
[00:40:34] I thought the British were admirable in this respect during World War two no matter how much discussion
[00:40:40] There had been on a subject as soon as a decision was made you never heard any doubts expressed
[00:40:45] You had to believe that everyone involved in making the decision had never entertained any ideas
[00:40:51] Except those expressed in the decision
[00:40:55] We could talk for a long long long time about this
[00:40:59] And the reason we could talk for a long long time about this is
[00:41:04] Because there's an element that comes into play when Dave and I are an echo or discussing how we're gonna execute something
[00:41:10] And that's that thing that comes into play is Dave's ego
[00:41:13] Echoes ego and my ego and once those things are in play
[00:41:18] all of a sudden
[00:41:20] It's very difficult for us to walk out of the room feeling like I support Dave's plan a hundred percent
[00:41:27] It's very very difficult because damn I'm just a little bit more
[00:41:32] Practically savvy than Davis and he's imposing this plan on me and he's not listening to what I'm saying and I'm gonna be pissed
[00:41:40] and
[00:41:41] By the way, I'm pissed echoes even more pissed because his plan was even more desperate than mine
[00:41:47] was from Dave's plans and his ego is even bigger so now we now he's
[00:41:52] Totally against what we're doing, but you've barked the order so we're gonna go do it
[00:41:56] We're gonna do it pissed and we're not gonna be successful. Will you put ego into this equation? This is what causes this problem
[00:42:02] Yeah, and that ego
[00:42:06] That ego when it comes out
[00:42:09] Will reveal itself when I now have to do your plan and it doesn't quite go the way that you were thinking and I kind of know
[00:42:14] That's gonna happen that my ego is almost gonna be happy to see that failure
[00:42:18] I'm gonna take some and I might I might be keeping my ego mostly in the control
[00:42:22] But there's a little part of me if I don't really have that thing in check
[00:42:25] a little part of me that's
[00:42:27] Once this little hiccup this little error this little failure this little setback
[00:42:31] I almost want it to happen and
[00:42:34] When I get to the point of how I'm actually supposed to work through that and solve that problem and my ego is really
[00:42:39] Barking at hate you knew this was coming you knew tacos plan was stupid and you knew this is gonna happen
[00:42:44] It's almost like I want that failure to occur
[00:42:47] So I can see do you go
[00:42:49] Told you man as opposed to
[00:42:51] Solving that which I probably can but how powerful the ego is and I think you've said it like I'd rather
[00:43:00] Be right then win. Oh, yeah, there's been countless people and and you know a good the the ultimate example
[00:43:07] That is there's people that would rather die themselves
[00:43:11] and get their men killed
[00:43:14] Then subordinate their ego to someone else or admit that they were wrong about something like that
[00:43:18] And then there's there's examples throughout history disgusting examples like that
[00:43:23] now
[00:43:25] Here's a I'm gonna give everyone
[00:43:28] Just a beautiful beautiful piece of advice right now
[00:43:32] And you know, I don't say this very often. This is a beautiful piece of advice to for everyone
[00:43:36] Here's my default mode when I walk into the planning room with Dave and echo
[00:43:42] My default mode is going with Dave's plan or I'm going with echoes man. My default mode is to support someone else's plan
[00:43:49] That's my default mode
[00:43:50] My default mode is not to impose my plan on everybody else never and by the way
[00:43:54] It doesn't matter if I'm the boss walking in to talk to you guys or if I'm the subordinate walking in to talk
[00:43:59] It doesn't matter my default mode is I'm gonna go with someone else's plan. I'm gonna go with what you recommend
[00:44:06] The only and look if you come up with the most wazoo plan ever created BTF Tony
[00:44:11] BTF Tony who I love
[00:44:15] Who's the freaking tactical is he's as tactically sound as any human has ever been and like he came up with
[00:44:24] In Ramadi, he's like I want to take the freaking like he wanted it. It was something that was like legitimately insane
[00:44:32] He wanted to take the little side be like a little side-by-side with himself just by himself and do like a patrol out
[00:44:38] It's just some random part of Ramadi and set up in a building or something because he thought he could get away with it
[00:44:43] Just going by himself
[00:44:45] I was like Tony, bro
[00:44:48] You can't do that dude
[00:44:49] You can't you can't just go by yourself and you know what? Hey, there's actually a 90% chance that it would have worked
[00:44:54] It's also a 10% chance. We never saw Tony again, which I was put the risk out, right?
[00:44:59] So Tony, I'm sorry, but like unless someone just comes up
[00:45:03] But other than that one time Tony and I in the time that we work together
[00:45:08] We were never in disagreement about a plan more than like
[00:45:14] 0.01% huh, you know like oh hit it from here up sounds good
[00:45:17] And you know what basically eventually as I worked with Leif and Seth it all became that now what I had to be careful of is
[00:45:27] What you already gave warning of like I didn't want
[00:45:30] To say like oh life came up with a plan. That's great. I don't question
[00:45:34] I would always pull myself back far enough to go. Okay, just make sure life. I'd make look at stoner's plan
[00:45:39] I'll just make sure yep. Hey, is there anything I can I poke any holes in this I?
[00:45:43] Hate saying devil's advocate, but you have to be a little bit of a devil's advocate to make sure that you're you're trying to poke holes
[00:45:50] In plans to see if there's any holes in there because you don't want to miss anything
[00:45:54] And the only way to be able to do that is if you're detached obviously
[00:45:57] but
[00:46:00] default
[00:46:02] Subordinate your ego and let's go with Dave's plan sounds good man
[00:46:05] And and and that's how you roll. That's how you solve that problem and
[00:46:11] By the way, the only part of you that really thinks your plan is better
[00:46:15] It's just your ego because because here's what you're planning what your planning is something that you can't know
[00:46:21] You're planning something that's gonna happen in the future
[00:46:23] Something that's gonna happen on enemy territory or against a competitor or in a market. You don't understand. That's what you're doing
[00:46:30] So when you come up with a plan
[00:46:33] It's about something that you can't guarantee anyways
[00:46:36] So why would you commit or over commit to it doesn't make any sense?
[00:46:44] So be careful that
[00:46:46] I
[00:46:48] Don't want to overemphasize leadership of senior officers my interest extends to leaders of all ranks
[00:46:55] I would caution you to always remember that an essential qualification of a good leader is the ability to recognize select and train junior leaders. I
[00:47:04] Would like to quote from a book entitled the born at Reveley and written by Colonel Red reader. I have this book in the queue by the way
[00:47:11] Colonel reader was on a trip for General Marshall and one of his assignments was to inquire into his junior leadership
[00:47:17] This is an account of his conversation with Colonel Bryant more on Guadalcanal
[00:47:23] Colonel more I said tell me something about leadership. I
[00:47:27] Had hit a sensitive spot. He forged ahead leadership
[00:47:30] The greatest problem here is the leaders and you have to find some way to weed out the weak ones
[00:47:36] It's tough to do this when you're in combat
[00:47:39] The platoon leaders who cannot command who cannot foresee things and who cannot act on spur of the moment
[00:47:46] In an emergency or a distinct detriment. That's what's so interesting
[00:47:52] This had a bunch of conversations with my last client about
[00:47:58] The psychology of military incompetence and
[00:48:01] The authoritarian mindset and how people do well that do well in garrison
[00:48:07] Don't do well in combat
[00:48:10] And that's what he's talking about people who can't foresee things people who cannot act on the spur of the moment in an emergency
[00:48:17] He goes on to say here. It's hot here as you can see men struggle. They get heat exhaustion
[00:48:22] They come out vomiting and throwing away equipment
[00:48:26] The leaders must be leaders and they must be alert to establish straggler lines and stop this thing
[00:48:31] The men have been taught to take salt tablets, but the leaders don't see to this the result heat exhaustion
[00:48:39] The good leaders seem to get killed
[00:48:42] The poor leaders get the men killed
[00:48:45] The big problem is leadership and getting the shoulder straps on the right people
[00:48:53] 60 millimeter Japanese mortars fit shells fell about 30 yards away and attacked a number of coconut trees
[00:48:59] I lost interest in taking dictation and the colonel stopped talking when the salvo was over and things were quiet again
[00:49:05] Bryant Moore said where was I you saw that patrol?
[00:49:09] I tell you this not one man in 50 can lead a patrol in this jungle
[00:49:13] If you can find one who the good patrol if you can find out who the good patrol leaders are before you hit a combat zone
[00:49:21] You have found something
[00:49:23] I have had to get rid of about two people
[00:49:26] I have had to get rid of about 25 officers because they just weren't leaders
[00:49:33] I had to make the battalion commander weed out poor junior leaders
[00:49:37] This process is continuous our junior leaders are finding out that they must know more about their men
[00:49:44] The good leaders know their men
[00:49:52] Man
[00:49:54] The
[00:49:57] It's weird that he would wrap up that section with good leaders know their men after talking about all these other things good leaders know their men
[00:50:06] He goes on now this is getting out of the quote from that book
[00:50:11] Raised it or born at Reveley says what are the distinguishing characteristics of a leader?
[00:50:17] There are many essential characteristics that he must possess
[00:50:20] But I will mention a few that come to mind as perhaps most important first
[00:50:24] He must know his job without necessarily being a specialist in every phase of it a few years ago
[00:50:29] It was suggested that all engineering subjects be eliminated from required studies at West Point. I
[00:50:36] Objected for example bridge building is a specialty for engineers yet
[00:50:40] I think every senior officer should have some idea of what is involved when we reach the Rhine in World War two
[00:50:46] It was not necessary that I know how to build a bridge, but it was very helpful that I knew what was involved so that I could see
[00:50:53] That the bridge engineers received proper support to in tonnage allowed and the an idea of the time involved
[00:51:02] Specialties dominate almost every problem faced today by the military leader or the business manager the this individual must get deeply
[00:51:10] Enough into his problem that he can understand it and intelligently manage it
[00:51:13] Without going so far as to become a specialist himself in every phase of the problem
[00:51:18] You don't have to be a tank expert in order to effectively use a tank of your command
[00:51:27] Yeah
[00:51:28] This makes me think at the basic school for the Marine Corps is that philosophy is I don't care what your job is gonna be
[00:51:34] You're gonna have some exposure to everything else
[00:51:36] You're not gonna be an expert in any of it
[00:51:38] But it sure does help a lot if I'm gonna work with you and you're an engineer and have some framework for what you're doing
[00:51:44] So I know what the challenges are
[00:51:46] So I know how to help you or support you or make sure you're at least getting what you need
[00:51:50] And the idea of not being a specialist but knowing what all your specialists are dealing with I
[00:51:56] Mean that served me well, and I think the very start for that for them for me was the Marine Corps the basic school
[00:52:01] Yeah, they get that baseline set for everybody everything
[00:52:04] Yep, and and look when you're at a business or you go into a business or you take over a business or you move into a new department
[00:52:11] You don't have to become an expert but to sit down and walk around walk the floor
[00:52:17] Go and do that thing, you know go go get on the manufacturing line and do the various parts of the job
[00:52:25] So you look you're gonna be terrible at it. You've never done it before
[00:52:29] But go do it. Yeah, and
[00:52:31] It's crazy how how easy that is and how much and I'm not exaggerating like in one day in one day
[00:52:37] How much you can learn from just spending one day out there?
[00:52:40] You do not need nor do they expect you to be an expert on any of this stuff and not just the mileage you get by just building the
[00:52:47] relationship but
[00:52:49] The amount of time that it takes to get
[00:52:52] Exposure what they're doing is actually really small. You don't need that much time to get out there on the line
[00:52:56] I go, oh, hey, let me try that. Hey, can I see that? Hey, how does this work and just in a few hours what you can learn?
[00:53:01] Especially when you're starting at zero if you're starting at zero you're gonna learn infinitely more in just a little bit of time
[00:53:07] So if you see this some giant daunting task, it's really not it's not nearly as hard
[00:53:11] And I remember this learning about you know inside of a squadron all the different things worked
[00:53:15] You spent an hour or two with somebody and just sit with them and have them show you their job
[00:53:20] And then you do their job for a little bit in a couple hours what you can learn from that
[00:53:23] Yeah, and compared to the people that didn't do that. You're a freaking expert totally
[00:53:28] so
[00:53:30] All right, here's one of his one to remember Thomas J. Watson of IBM once said that genius in an executive is
[00:53:39] The ability to deal successfully with matters. He does not understand
[00:53:44] So good and and my note when I read that is
[00:53:54] The genius
[00:53:56] What will make this person be able to successfully deal with matters that they don't understand is
[00:54:02] Having the humility to admit that they don't understand and saying all right
[00:54:08] Let's let's get this figured out because I don't know what to do right now
[00:54:11] This leads to another principle of leadership which I have often found neglected both in military and in business
[00:54:18] While you need not be a specialist in all phases of your job
[00:54:21] You should have a proportionate degree of interest in every aspect of it
[00:54:27] And those concerned your subordinates should be aware of your interest. That's what you just talked about Dave
[00:54:34] You must get around and show interest in what your subordinates are doing even if you don't know much about
[00:54:40] the technique of their work and when you are making these visits
[00:54:44] Try to pass out praise when do as well as corrections or criticism. There you go
[00:54:48] It's what you just talked about go light on the criticism part. You don't even know what the hell you're doing
[00:54:53] Let me show you how to work that thing there son. No, don't do that
[00:54:58] We tend to speak up only when things go wrong
[00:55:01] This is such a well-recognized fact that a complete department is an essential part of many business firms to my knowledge
[00:55:08] No comparable faculty exists anywhere to expedite the handling of praise for a job well done
[00:55:16] It's a good point
[00:55:19] We all get enough criticism and we learn to take it even Sir Winston Churchill despite his matchless
[00:55:24] accomplishment found occasion to say I have benefited enormously from criticism and at no point did I suffer from any perceptible lack thereof
[00:55:33] So he's always getting criticized even Churchill but let us remember that praise also has a role to play
[00:55:40] Napoleon was probably the finest exponent of this principle of recognition through his use of a quarter inch of ribbon to improve the
[00:55:46] Moral and get results since the quote from Napoleon where he said you can basically get someone to do anything by giving him a little ribbon
[00:55:53] And he's right
[00:55:57] Both mental and physical energy are essential
[00:56:00] To successful leadership how many good leaders have you known who were lazy or weak or who couldn't stand the strain
[00:56:08] Sherman was a good example of a leader without standing mental and physical energy
[00:56:12] I cite him with some trepidation because some of you may be from Georgia
[00:56:16] However during the advance from chat chat a new job chat a new guy to Atlanta
[00:56:21] He often went for days with only two or three hours of sleep per night and was constantly in the saddle
[00:56:26] Reconning and often knew the dispositions and terrain so well that he could maneuver the enemy out of position without a serious fight and with minimum losses
[00:56:37] Conversely a sick commander is of limited value it is not fair to the troops under him to have a leader who's not functioning 100%
[00:56:47] I had to receive relieve several senior commanders during World War two because of illness
[00:56:51] It is often pointed out that Napoleon didn't lose a major battle until Waterloo where he was a sick man
[00:56:57] So lazy weak
[00:57:00] That's a problem
[00:57:03] A leader should possess human understanding and consideration for others
[00:57:08] Men are not robots and should not be treated as though they were machines so this goes back to the idea of AI
[00:57:15] But I think you're I think you're a very good leader
[00:57:18] I think you're I think they're pretty easily going to be able to put morale and emotion emotional programming into
[00:57:28] Leadership decision-making oh squints squints over there from echo Charles. Am I wrong?
[00:57:35] Eventually, I mean I guess that the argument for AI is like you know how AI works
[00:57:40] It's like it's a constantly learning learning learning learning right from like input input learn learn learn
[00:57:45] So in the beginning it'll probably be like freakin you watch a demolition man
[00:57:50] Remember I'm moving I think I'm pretty sure I walked out of the movie demolition man
[00:57:56] Okay, so and then I miss something big like it was dumb
[00:58:01] I'm not gonna argue whether it was a semester song. Yeah, yeah, I walked out of it was dumb
[00:58:05] So it was dumb seemingly was really dumb right seemingly but oh there's an odd layer
[00:58:10] I missed out on yet metaphorical masterpiece that I get snuck by me, but I wouldn't say masterpiece. Okay, but
[00:58:18] There's a part on there real subtle part subtlety subtlety where Simon Phoenix, right? He's a bad guy
[00:58:25] I got a cryo prison whatever and he goes to one of these booths as these booths rolling around like that
[00:58:30] There's just a booth for like whatever you want kind of a thing. It's like an ATM for anything
[00:58:35] So this booth can give you like it's like the internet is on there and all this stuff
[00:58:42] But it can give you a mood adjustment
[00:58:44] So if you're like, oh, I want to ego boost right and you press the buttons or whatever and it says boy
[00:58:50] You look great today
[00:58:51] Like that can stuff but in real life that wouldn't really work right because you're programming the machine
[00:58:56] I need to go but oh you look great today a machine giving me compliments after I asked it like brother
[00:59:00] That doesn't work like that, but the AI thinks it does see I'm saying so if you're trying to program
[00:59:06] Emotional stuff like morale boosting stuff in an AI at first. It's gonna look like that. Yeah, but but here's my counter argument
[00:59:14] I don't really want to go full like Lex Friedman like discussion on AI because I don't know enough about it
[00:59:19] but
[00:59:20] you could probably
[00:59:22] Put a program in there that we would say something like hey echo Charles. I've assessed your appearance and
[00:59:29] and
[00:59:30] Comparatively to the rest of the population today. You are in the top 6% of looking good
[00:59:37] Congratulations echo go have a fun day. So now all of a sudden it's giving you some data
[00:59:41] Here's my hypothesis. I get it and look that's not a terrible assessment
[00:59:46] But I would think I think anyway and try search your emotional soul not you jockeau Dave
[00:59:54] search your emotional like party where like
[00:59:56] Even if it's true if it's coming from a machine who cares it has to come from a actual person who quote-unquote
[01:00:04] Understands me at the very least as a person. So I'm saying so like a ego boost from machine
[01:00:09] Just the mere fact that it's not from an actual person
[01:00:12] Brats it's hard. Yeah, I can't have you ever had any kind of like
[01:00:18] feelings
[01:00:19] Towards an inanimate object
[01:00:21] Like a guitar like you've got like real expensive computers, right? Yes
[01:00:26] Have you ever had a computer that you kind of had like some kind of bond with no?
[01:00:30] No, and here to answer your question Dave. Did you have any kind of bond with your airplane? Oh hell? Yeah, absolutely
[01:00:36] But it's like I have feelings for the airplanes that I flew there. I remember looking at I'm going down
[01:00:42] Right, but I would be surprised if you didn't look at a heavy machine gonna go
[01:00:46] I really like the way you look today. Yeah, but the machine isn't the thing that's giving you the compliment
[01:00:51] It's like it'll have to do I think you know, I don't know I could be wrong. I'm not Lex Friedman. You guys know this
[01:00:58] It's usually has to do a lot with or probably everything to do with what you specifically did in
[01:01:04] With this machine that gave you certain personal feelings like personal unique very unique in like not replicable
[01:01:13] You got to remember like right now. There's chat. There's people right now. There's bots on Twitter today
[01:01:19] We're probably less today, but there's there's bots and stuff out there that are having conversations with people and people can't tell
[01:01:24] Yeah, they can't tell yes true, but once they knew it was a bot if you tell them it's a bot brother
[01:01:29] It's gonna change right they're not gonna be oh equally as in lover only thing you got to get over is like the little hump of
[01:01:38] You just tell people like oh no this thing can actually assess
[01:01:41] Wait where you're at and then people go okay. This computer is smarter than your wife
[01:01:46] So your wife telling you look good is fine, but this thing telling you look good is factual. So there you go
[01:01:53] Believe it you go up. What'd you say ego boost you go boost? Yeah
[01:01:56] Go boost I'm trying to think like because not now that you put it like that. I kind of like yeah, maybe but like I
[01:02:02] Still it's hard. Let me give you an example. Let me give you an example JP to know sure hell
[01:02:08] Yeah, he was wearing like a wrist strap that told him if he was tired or not
[01:02:15] Yeah, he believed it. Yeah, he took it off. Yeah, because he was having bad days
[01:02:22] Because that thing told him he was tired. He didn't feel tired, but he that thing said hey, you're tired and he was like oh damn
[01:02:28] I'm tired. Oh, yeah, and so he did that happened a few times. He said you know what this is bullshit
[01:02:33] Yeah, but so he believed the machine it affected his mood because it had the data
[01:02:39] Hmm so end of discussion. I think you can just stand down bro because I think that he's got proven wrong
[01:02:47] So like if it was like an evil you got ego down
[01:02:52] So if it was like a report card like
[01:02:55] Hmm a report card that maybe cuz think about it. Okay, this team needs a morale boost
[01:03:00] They're losing right or whatever
[01:03:02] So what what would the machine do like assess the good things that are happening and report back?
[01:03:07] Yeah, imagine imagine at halftime
[01:03:10] The the coach comes in and he's like hey, I'm checking your your whoops straps right now
[01:03:15] I'm checking your data
[01:03:17] Everyone has more energy than they had at halftime than we did at the last game that we won
[01:03:21] You guys have the power to get and that was true. Yeah
[01:03:25] Yeah
[01:03:27] So that's that machine can you affect your mood is what I'm saying
[01:03:31] I guess yep, yep, I guess like hidden information or something that you might be ignoring like that something like that
[01:03:38] I'm saying that a
[01:03:42] Machine
[01:03:44] Can affect someone's mood. Hey, I you know what I have a machine affect my mood
[01:03:49] Damn printer doesn't work. Yeah, right printer doesn't work all of a sudden. I'm like damn. I'm mad. I get angry
[01:03:56] I think that's a different thing, but
[01:03:58] All right, so check this out what we're saying is men are not robots
[01:04:02] It should not be treated as if they were and he says this I do not by any means suggest coddling
[01:04:09] But men are highly intelligent complicated beings who respond favorable
[01:04:15] Favorably to human understanding and consideration by this means their leader will get maximum effort from each of them
[01:04:23] He will also get loyalty and in this connection. It is well to remember that loyalty goes down as well as up
[01:04:31] The sincere leader will go to bat for his subordinates when such action is needed
[01:04:38] Take care of your people and your people will take care of you a
[01:04:43] Good leader must sometimes be stubborn
[01:04:46] Here I am reminded of the West Point cadet prayer a leader must be able to choose the harder right
[01:04:52] Instead of the easier wrong armed with courage of his convictions. He must often fight to defend them
[01:04:59] Then he has to come to decision after thorough analysis and
[01:05:04] When he assures, he's right. He must stick to it even to the point of stubbornness
[01:05:08] Grant furnishes a good illustration of this trait
[01:05:12] He never knew what he was supposed to be licked a less stubborn man might have lost at Shiloh
[01:05:18] Maybe you've heard the story of Grant in the Richmond campaign when after being up all night making his reconnaissance and
[01:05:25] Formulating and issuing orders. He laid down under a tree and fell asleep sometime later
[01:05:30] A courier rode up and informed the general that disaster had hit his right flank and that his troops at the end of that line
[01:05:37] Were in full retreat
[01:05:39] General Grant sat up
[01:05:41] Shook his head to clear the cobwebs and said it can't be so and went back to sleep and
[01:05:48] It wasn't so he had confidence in himself and in his subordinate leaders
[01:05:54] so
[01:05:55] There you go, and we just
[01:05:57] Did you have a chance to listen to Civil War? No, not yet excursion
[01:06:00] We're just about the grants just about the role in the scene from the east or sorry from the west the Western or the Western campaign
[01:06:07] Grants about the role in there because he's winning
[01:06:09] So it's gonna be it's gonna be cool to get into him as a leader
[01:06:14] He goes on to say this
[01:06:15] I do not mean to infer that there is always just one solution to a problem usually there's one best
[01:06:21] Solution but any good plan boldly executed is better than indecision. There is usually more than one way to attain results
[01:06:27] This goes back to what I was saying earlier. That's why I'll go with Dave's plan. I'll go to the echoes plan
[01:06:31] I don't care. I don't care because the time we waste arguing about which way is better is
[01:06:35] Time of indecision and that's what's gonna cost us
[01:06:40] So Dave you got a decent plan a minimally viable plan cool go execute
[01:06:45] Damn we we work together right now Dave
[01:06:49] You are executing things like
[01:06:52] wildly
[01:06:55] Often executing plans executing missions and I mean you usually
[01:07:01] Sometimes give me like a after-action report sometimes about how it went and everything
[01:07:06] You know if there's something outstanding that happened outstanding in any direction
[01:07:10] Maybe something good. Maybe something like oh this week we could have done this better. Yeah, but I
[01:07:15] mean
[01:07:17] That's how you have to run things so much easier
[01:07:21] Yeah, I'm
[01:07:24] There's a lot of these comments that he's made like the course that you're reading
[01:07:28] I'm trying to picture hearing this and
[01:07:33] There are times you say something and and people like oh
[01:07:37] He just said defend defend your convictions
[01:07:40] And it's like a little if you don't understand what the context of that
[01:07:44] There's a little bit of risk in there because that can be like hey listen
[01:07:47] I'm sorry, Jocko, but this is how I want to get this thing done and I'm gonna defend
[01:07:52] That conviction and I just can't help but think about
[01:07:55] Like this the example you and I that you were talking about about you and me and
[01:08:00] Something we have to think about echelon for all the time is a lot of times when people hear these military examples
[01:08:06] We're talking about the conflict. We're having with our enemies
[01:08:10] Like he just told that story like a lesser man when I've lost that battle. Hey listen when you're fighting like an actual enemy
[01:08:15] Defend those convictions, but if Jocko and I are on the same team and we're actually working together
[01:08:21] I am far less inclined. I'm almost not inclined at all to defend my convictions
[01:08:28] And of course I gotta be careful with that too. You said it well, that's a dichotomy
[01:08:31] I don't want to just roll over and say whatever you want, but if I come in with a plan you come into the plan
[01:08:35] I go oh
[01:08:36] Dude, that's a that's a totally reasonable plan. That plan will probably work. I
[01:08:41] Am not inclined to defend my convictions against you. Who is my ally?
[01:08:46] Who's my friend who's who wants the same out?
[01:08:48] You know good outcome that I want which is very different from an
[01:08:52] Actual opponent an actual enemy, you know in the military those are very stark obvious contrasts. We're fighting against the Nazis
[01:08:59] We're gonna defend those convictions to the end or like another company that
[01:09:03] They don't want to coexist with you want to take all your clients and run you into the ground
[01:09:07] So just even being cautious with the idea of defending those convictions if it's someone on my team and they have an idea
[01:09:13] The chances are especially if it's like most companies most people aren't dumb most people are pretty smart
[01:09:18] They got an idea they thought about it
[01:09:19] If I can find any reason to abandon my position and go your position
[01:09:23] I'm gonna do that unless once like you said once in a blue moon like dude
[01:09:28] Your idea is terrible and we just kind of talk through it. It's not that big of a deal
[01:09:32] I reveal a couple things move on but 99 times out of 100 your ideas and my ideas
[01:09:37] They're actually both gonna work and if you got an idea
[01:09:40] I am not inclined to be quite honest. I am not inclined to defend my idea not because I want to I don't want to upset you
[01:09:47] And you're my boss right it's because I don't do that's totally gonna work
[01:09:50] Let's just go execute on that and what that actually gives me is what you just described the end is
[01:09:56] and I want to be careful with this but I
[01:10:00] Don't spend a lot of time telling you what I plan on doing now. Listen. We are strategically aligned
[01:10:06] We have we as a whole company we meet and we get aligned strategically
[01:10:09] And I don't mean to say that people should be out there operating the total autonomy
[01:10:13] But in terms of this day this event this thing
[01:10:16] It's I don't spend a lot of time walking you through with what my plans are because six seven years into this
[01:10:23] We've gotten to a point where Dave can go execute and you're comfortable with that
[01:10:27] and my point of that is
[01:10:29] Because I don't spend a lot of time trying to force my way into what I want to do you've learned like hey Dave's a flexible guy
[01:10:34] He's he's gonna get to the same outcome his way my way doesn't really matter and that's cultivated a bunch of trust
[01:10:39] So defending your convictions if you're not careful can actually make you appear to be stubborn to a fault and now
[01:10:45] Jocko might be like is Dave gonna adjust as he needs to with this client or is he gonna just dig into his plan?
[01:10:52] so
[01:10:53] Be careful about defending your convictions as well depending on the situation especially what it is that you're trying to accomplish
[01:10:58] Yeah, I think
[01:11:00] What could get confusing for someone?
[01:11:03] It's just confusing the words conviction and idea. Yeah, right
[01:11:07] For me to have a conviction that we should take care of our clients
[01:11:15] I'm gonna defend that conviction so when Dave rolls up to me and it's like hey, Jocko
[01:11:19] I think we could screw this client over and get some more money from them and do less work and it
[01:11:24] Doesn't really matter about what the outcome is. Yeah now. We're I'm not gonna be like that sounds like a good idea
[01:11:32] Because we're not aligned
[01:11:34] Now but defending ideas which is like ideas like I said earlier ideas can be pretty much worthless, right?
[01:11:41] And and if we are gonna assign value to an idea
[01:11:45] We're assigning value to my idea and assigning value to your idea
[01:11:50] We can't assign a lot of value to either one of those things because neither one of them has any execution behind it yet
[01:11:55] So we're just basically assigning value to air. It's like it's like dogecoin, right?
[01:12:01] We're just kind of assigning or what is it f TT which is the f TT is what the FTX token
[01:12:08] So these are the guys Sam Bakeman Friedman Sam Bake Friedman
[01:12:13] SPF this guy ripped off billions of dollars from people and one of the ways that he did
[01:12:18] What was they made their own little cryptocurrency and just assigned value to it said?
[01:12:23] Oh, yeah, this this has this value and then they borrowed money against this thing that they made up
[01:12:27] And everyone said this guy's smart and he's really nice. So we're gonna give him we're gonna let him keep doing it
[01:12:32] That's what that's what so when we assign if I assign my idea value and I assign your idea value
[01:12:38] I can't assign it that much value because it's just something that we both made up. Yeah, so why am I gonna over invest in FTT?
[01:12:45] It's worthless
[01:12:47] It has no value. You also can't see the future. I can't see you. What are you arguing?
[01:12:52] What are you fighting me over? Yeah, the the unknown of the outcome
[01:12:55] So the convictions, you know when we're in combat and the conviction of hey
[01:13:02] We need to do to have the high ground morally with the enemy. Yes
[01:13:09] I'll defend that high ground. I'll defend that conviction all day now
[01:13:15] Even the idea of hey Dave, we need to get the high ground tactically
[01:13:19] I'll defend that really strong
[01:13:21] But you might say hey, John, listen, we got a AC 130 that's gonna be overhead and we don't need the high ground
[01:13:26] And we could it'd be much smarter to have these troops over here on this piece of terrain
[01:13:30] Which will set up a blocking force for where the enemy is located. I
[01:13:34] Can adjust that that's an idea and look I'm as I'm as about committed to the tactic of taking the high ground as a human could possibly be
[01:13:43] But I'm not going to die. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna die on it unless you know
[01:13:49] Dave's like well the high ground doesn't matter whatever and I'm looking at it
[01:13:53] Well, what are you gonna do if the enemy gets up there? Yeah, well, I'm not worried about it. Okay. Well, we need to worry about it
[01:13:57] So that's a different so just don't confuse
[01:14:00] Defending your conviction with defending your idea defending your plan defending your thoughts even and open your mind
[01:14:08] That that conviction versus ideas is awesome because the conviction we actually have to agree on we are going to take care of our people
[01:14:15] We are going to help these clients be successful and if you discover that I'm like actually what I want to do is
[01:14:21] I'm gonna lie to them that makes a month. Yeah, that's the conviction and then the ideas
[01:14:26] It's so much easier to not care so much about the ideas if you know that we're aligned on that conviction like oh
[01:14:31] Dave's going a totally different direction. He's gonna get to that high ground. It's just his way of doing it
[01:14:35] But he actually sees we that clients getting taken care of or give an impact and my point to that is
[01:14:41] We don't talk about the tactical ideas nearly as much as we used to because you're like, oh, yeah, I know where he's going
[01:14:46] I know what Dave's doing and and
[01:14:48] Yeah, we have a pretty good thing going and you don't just cut people loose
[01:14:52] But if you can be aligned the convictions, it's so much easier to be flexible the ideas. Yeah, like
[01:14:57] worst case scenario
[01:15:00] You didn't actually you like as long as you're not going against the convictions that we share
[01:15:06] There's actually nothing you can screw up bad enough to like have a problem, right?
[01:15:11] You know, there's nothing that we can't clean up on a phone call. We're like, hey, dude
[01:15:15] I
[01:15:16] I over indexed a little bit
[01:15:17] We spent a little too much money on this client and I owe them another two gigs and and by the way they really want you
[01:15:23] So you're coming to it. I'm like, all right, cool, right, you know, Jamie
[01:15:26] Booking me for free gigs across America. Jamie Cochran. Thank you. No, don't call Jamie. She's not doing anymore. All right
[01:15:33] Going back to the book here another quality of leadership that comes to mind is self-confidence
[01:15:39] You must have confidence in yourself your unit and your subordinate commanders and in your plan
[01:15:44] This recalls a couple of incidents
[01:15:46] Just before the invasion of Normandy in 1944 a story went around that some of the units were making the assault on the beaches
[01:15:52] That they would suffer 100% casualties that none of them would come back. I
[01:15:57] Found it necessary to visit these units and talk to all ranks. I told them that of course
[01:16:02] We would suffer casualties, but certainly our losses would not be a hundred percent and that with our air and naval support
[01:16:08] We would succeed
[01:16:10] After our landing a correspondent told me that on his way across the channel in one of the late leading
[01:16:15] LSTs he had noticed a sergeant reading a novel struck by the seeming lack of concern
[01:16:21] By this sergeant. He asked aren't you worried? How can you be reading at a time like this?
[01:16:26] The staff sergeant replied no, I'm not worried general Bradley said everything will go all right
[01:16:31] So why should I worry?
[01:16:34] Yeah
[01:16:35] confidence
[01:16:36] Right there in the middle right there nice and balanced confidence not overconfident not arrogant, but not self-doubting
[01:16:43] That's for sure. I might relate another incident where there's a lack lack of confidence
[01:16:48] Where there's a lack of confidence
[01:16:49] I had to relieve a senior commander because I learned his men had lost confidence in him this meant of course that we could not
[01:16:56] Expect maximum performance by that division after being relieved
[01:17:01] The officer came through month came back through my headquarters and showed me a file of statements given to him by his request
[01:17:08] I am sure by the burgo master of all the towns his divisions had passed through
[01:17:14] If he had confidence in himself, he would not have felt the need for those letters
[01:17:20] Pretty good one
[01:17:22] So you shouldn't fire me look at everyone loves me. I've got a bunch of letters to prove it. Okay
[01:17:29] After seeing the letters
[01:17:30] I told the officer that if I had ever had any doubts as to whether to relieve him those doubts were now removed
[01:17:37] His letters proved beyond question that he had lost confidence in himself
[01:17:41] So it's no wonder his men had lost confidence in him to a
[01:17:45] leader must possess
[01:17:47] imagination
[01:17:47] Whether it be an administrative decision or one mating combat the possible results of that decision must be playing to the one making it
[01:17:55] What will be the next step and the one after that?
[01:17:59] He only wrote one little two paragraph sentence about imagination
[01:18:04] Wish I had a little bit more
[01:18:08] Next while there are many other qualities which contribute to effective leadership, I will mention just one more
[01:18:14] But it is a very important one
[01:18:16] character
[01:18:18] This word has many meanings
[01:18:21] I'm applying it in the broad sense to character
[01:18:25] I'm applying it to the broad sense to describe a person who has high ideals who stands by them and who can be trusted absolutely
[01:18:32] Such a person will be respected by all those with whom he is associated and
[01:18:37] Such a person will readily be recognized by his associates for what he is
[01:18:42] Circumstances mold our character
[01:18:46] These circumstances affect different people in different ways
[01:18:50] From exactly the same set of circumstances
[01:18:55] One man may theoretically build a palace
[01:18:58] While another may have difficulty building a lean to
[01:19:06] It has been said that a man's character is the reality of himself
[01:19:10] I don't think a man's strength of character ever changes
[01:19:14] I remember a long time ago when someone told me that a mountain might be reported to have moved
[01:19:20] I could believe or disbelieve it as I wished but if anyone told me that a man had to change his character, I should not believe it
[01:19:27] So this is a very
[01:19:29] This whole thing about character. First of all, it's a little strange
[01:19:33] There's a little contradiction in there that he made which is
[01:19:37] Circumstances
[01:19:40] mold our character
[01:19:42] So he's saying that your circumstance that your character does change
[01:19:46] Based on circumstances circumstance molds your character and then he's saying that character is not going to change
[01:19:53] It's more likely that a mountain gets moved than your character changes. So he's he's
[01:19:58] Got a little hypocritical
[01:20:00] Statement here, but I think I understand what he's getting at right?
[01:20:04] I understand what he's getting at right?
[01:20:07] um
[01:20:08] I mean, I think he's just talking about the fact that
[01:20:11] Your character is molded over time
[01:20:14] But once that character is established, it can't be changed now. I can tell you this. I've seen people's character changed
[01:20:21] Right. Usually it takes a pretty significant event
[01:20:25] to change someone's character
[01:20:27] Uh, maybe they get fired
[01:20:29] But sometimes people get fired and they there's no no character change whatsoever. They're just still pissed at everybody else
[01:20:35] but
[01:20:36] Someone gets fired someone gets killed like something some very big event
[01:20:42] Can change someone's character
[01:20:44] also
[01:20:45] A series of smaller events. I mean you look at someone
[01:20:49] That you know the kid that you went to high school with and then they joined the marine corps and you see him seven years later
[01:20:55] And you're like damn that's a that's a different dude. That's a changing character
[01:20:58] So I think the character can change
[01:21:01] In fact, I know it can yeah
[01:21:04] I'm I'm going through what you're doing trying to latch on what he's saying and understanding where he's coming from
[01:21:10] and I I 100% agree with you like
[01:21:13] I have seen enough things happen in my life around people that those are character changing events like like you've described
[01:21:20] I'm just thinking of the other side of it too trying to
[01:21:22] Like a contemplate what he's saying is and we've talked about this when someone reveals that a character to you
[01:21:29] Believe them that component of like hey if jaco if I catch and go oh dang
[01:21:35] Jocos maneuvering for himself or jaco deep down is actually trying to do this for him
[01:21:42] I have to understand like that's who he is and
[01:21:46] There's a balance inside there too
[01:21:47] But I'm just like I said I'm trying to latch on what he's talking about and we've talked about this idea of somebody's character
[01:21:51] If they reveal something about themselves you you have to you cannot pretend like that's not the case or just through some conversation
[01:21:58] You're gonna change that character. So I do believe that
[01:22:01] Well, I don't believe I know that people's character can change and I don't think there's some age by which it it's now
[01:22:06] immovable I think the older you get the harder that is
[01:22:09] but
[01:22:10] Don't be naive about someone's character either. Yeah, the tricky thing about that is you know
[01:22:17] Many of us myself included we're
[01:22:19] Optimist we're optimistic people. Yeah, and so I see Dave like short cutting something and I was like
[01:22:28] He's part of my team like we're on the same team. Yeah, he's not he's not gonna do that
[01:22:33] You see it again. You're like, oh, you know
[01:22:35] He probably just doesn't you make a bunch of excuses for somebody and what you're saying is important
[01:22:40] You need to when you see those things
[01:22:42] You need to put it in the calculus, man
[01:22:45] put that into the calculus
[01:22:47] because it's
[01:22:48] that is a
[01:22:50] That is what you're dealing with right that is what you're dealing with as a person
[01:22:56] Is what is their character?
[01:22:59] The thing about the other huge takeaway from this which is extremely important
[01:23:05] Is that you can take two people?
[01:23:08] With different character put them in the exact same
[01:23:11] Circumstances one person's gonna build a palace the other person's gonna have difficulty putting up a lean to
[01:23:16] And what that means is you as an individual
[01:23:22] You you need to take ownership of what's happening and make things happen like that's this is this is extreme ownership, right?
[01:23:28] One person can look at a situation and go okay. Well, hey, there's a bunch of rock here
[01:23:34] Well, I guess I'm gonna build a palace another person looks at it goes. Oh, there's a bunch of rock here
[01:23:40] How am I gonna build a lean to there's no sticks like they can't figure it out
[01:23:44] so
[01:23:47] Getting and and
[01:23:49] surrounding yourself
[01:23:51] And training people this I believe is a trained attribute as well look just like every other attribute
[01:23:58] Some people have a more positive outlook, right? You got to have got got the guy in your company
[01:24:02] You got the guy in your platoon that's like, oh, this is never gonna work. What is it?
[01:24:06] I think life babbon likes to quote the alien guys
[01:24:09] Um, you know 17 days. We're not even making 17 minutes, man
[01:24:13] Like that kind of at that guy. There's one of those guys in every platoon totally, right? They're in every platoon
[01:24:18] They're in every company every team. There's no way we're gonna beat the competition with this thing
[01:24:21] This all this is no like they're hating life. You know, it's funny. I wrote down. I didn't say it
[01:24:25] But you know, that's the negative people we we have a name for them. It's naysayers, right?
[01:24:29] There's an actual word for that person the English language is so filled with people like that that we have a word for them
[01:24:34] It's called a naysayer, right? They exist. They're a type of person
[01:24:38] But I think over time you can train people where they start looking at this problem cool, but
[01:24:45] I'm not just gonna find a solution. I'm gonna take advantage of this situation. We're gonna do we're gonna do even more
[01:24:49] We're gonna do even better positive things are gonna happen. Yeah
[01:24:52] so
[01:24:54] Take that
[01:24:55] into your next scenario
[01:24:58] The next circumstances you're put in and ask yourself. I'm gonna build a palace or we're gonna build a lean to which one
[01:25:03] I'm gonna do
[01:25:05] I'm gonna build a palace or I'm gonna struggle to build a lean to
[01:25:09] That's the question
[01:25:12] All right, then he goes on to say um
[01:25:16] all leaders
[01:25:17] Must possess these qualities which I've been discussing and the great leaders are those who possess one or more of them to an outstanding degree
[01:25:25] Some leaders just miss being great because they are weak in one or more of these areas
[01:25:30] There is still another ingredient in this formula for a great leader that I have left out and that is luck
[01:25:38] He must have opportunity then of course when opportunity knocks he must be able to rise and open the door
[01:25:45] Some may ask why do you talk about the qualities of leadership?
[01:25:48] They maintain that you either have leadership or you don't that leaders are born not made
[01:25:54] I suppose some are born with a certain amount of leadership
[01:25:57] Frequently we see young children inclined to take charge and direct their playmates
[01:26:02] The other youngsters follow these directions without protest, but I am convinced nevertheless that leadership can't be developed and improved by training
[01:26:10] Well, well, there's no doubt about that. That's again
[01:26:14] Um something else I stole like I hadn't read this before I wrote leadership strategy and tactics, but
[01:26:19] You know, it's uh, are leaders born or made the answer? Yes, they are born and they are made
[01:26:25] And he says there's no better way to develop leadership than to give the youngster or other individual a job involving
[01:26:32] Responsibility and let them work it out. Again, this is my favorite leadership strategy and tactics
[01:26:35] What's my favorite tool for leadership leadership?
[01:26:38] Put them in charge put them in charge
[01:26:40] Put them in charge. That's what you do
[01:26:43] Try to avoid telling them how to do it. Boom
[01:26:46] Decentralized command that for example is the basis of our whole system of combat orders, which there's a whole
[01:26:51] We've talked about this on multiple different podcasts, but you know mission type orders not telling people what to do just tell them
[01:26:59] What needs to get done
[01:27:01] Why it needs to get done and let them go figure out we tell a subordinate unit commander that we want him to do
[01:27:07] What we want him to do and then we leave him to the details
[01:27:12] I think this system is largely responsible for the many fine leaders in our services today
[01:27:16] We are constantly training and developing younger officers and teachers
[01:27:19] Training and developing younger officers and teaching them how to respect
[01:27:23] accept responsibility
[01:27:28] I was saying this I said this at a muster like
[01:27:31] Every moment of every day is an opportunity for training your people like anything that you do if you it's so awesome
[01:27:38] You don't need to go on some big
[01:27:41] Training trip with your team. No you work in the you work in a sales group. Cool
[01:27:46] You're doing a presentation to some client potential client. Cool junior guy echo. Hey, you're gonna present these guys
[01:27:52] Hey, you're not oh, you're not ready to present me. You're at least gonna put together a plan
[01:27:55] You're gonna brief me in that way. I can get to know the numbers and then I'll brief it because you're not there yet
[01:28:00] Uh, we own a construction company. Okay, cool echo. You're gonna come up with a plan on how we're gonna do this concrete pour
[01:28:06] You're gonna brief me it
[01:28:08] I'm gonna poke some holes in it, but you know, that's pretty much what we're going with it
[01:28:11] Look if it's bad if it's horrible if it's gonna be a disaster then we're gonna stop and I'll make the adjustments
[01:28:17] But you're gonna come up with a plan and that's what you do. You have the opportunity to train people all day every day with everything
[01:28:22] that you do your family
[01:28:25] You got to make dinner. You got to go to the grocery store. You got to
[01:28:29] Get the yard cleanup. Everything one of those things is an opportunity for you train your team your your your children
[01:28:35] On how to come up with a plan how to execute a plan how to build teamwork how to do things efficiently like these are all opportunities
[01:28:42] So everything that you're doing all day long you have the opportunity to train people
[01:28:48] He goes on to say however
[01:28:51] Don't discount experience someone may remind you that Napoleon led armies before he was 30 and that Alexander the great
[01:28:58] died at the age of 33
[01:29:00] Napoleon as he grew older even commanded even larger armies Alexander might have been even greater had he lived longer and had more experience
[01:29:08] In this respect, I especially like general Buckner's theory that judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment
[01:29:21] And then he goes on to say I have been asked to speak on leadership in the past
[01:29:25] I have fairly well covered these same thoughts with other groups
[01:29:28] Somehow however at the moment these thoughts
[01:29:32] Take on added significance for me. You see my first great grandson was born a year ago. We call him fat Henry
[01:29:40] What happens to his life and to the lives of his contemporaries may well be in your hands?
[01:29:46] Thank you
[01:29:49] And that is the end of this
[01:29:51] That's the end of this particular speech and you know, I've got a book
[01:29:54] I've got a manual department of the army pamphlet 600 tax 65
[01:30:00] That's just got it's got a bunch. It's just it's a book of military quotes
[01:30:04] And there's a bunch in there from Omar Bradley the greatest leader in the world could never win a campaign unless he understood the men he had the lead
[01:30:13] Good to know
[01:30:15] The American soldier is one proud is a proud one and he demands professional competence in his leaders in battle
[01:30:22] He wants to know that the job is going to be done right with no unnecessary casualties
[01:30:27] The non-commissioned officer wearing the chevron is supposed to be the best soldier in the platoon
[01:30:31] And he's supposed to know how to perform all the duties expected the American soldier
[01:30:36] The period the American American
[01:30:39] Soldiers expects his sergeant to be able to teach him how to do his job and he expects even more from his officers boom
[01:30:47] Fairness diligence sound preparation
[01:30:49] Professional skill and loyalty are the marks of American military leadership
[01:30:57] There you go
[01:30:59] Another one in war there is no second prize for runner-up. It's a good one to remember
[01:31:05] Another one leadership in a democratic army means firmness not harshness
[01:31:12] Understanding not weakness
[01:31:14] Generosity not selfishness pride not egotism
[01:31:21] So he just kind of rolled out some dichotomies for you. He's giving you the balanced one and he's giving you the tendency that most people have
[01:31:32] Military organizations success and success in battle depend upon discipline and a high sense of honor
[01:31:38] Did they just roll out these quotes?
[01:31:44] The nation today needs men who think in terms of service to their country and not in terms of their country's debt to them
[01:31:50] That was 1948. I think maybe JFK jacked that one a little bit, right? Did JFK jack that sounds like a little bit
[01:32:00] Remember a good leader is one who causes or inspires others staffer subordinate to the job. We already hit that one
[01:32:06] Um
[01:32:08] So there you go
[01:32:10] this guy
[01:32:11] definitely some good information
[01:32:14] some good things to think about
[01:32:16] and
[01:32:18] You know, it's leadership and it's leadership as applied to life
[01:32:23] so
[01:32:24] Um more leadership more life lessons to be learned
[01:32:28] Trying to get better
[01:32:31] Echo Charles is trying to get better
[01:32:33] Yep
[01:32:34] What do you got? Yeah, I didn't really talk much about working out that much. No. No, he did say he did say physically fit
[01:32:40] Oh, yeah, back. He got that one. He said you got to back it up. He did. So you can't be weak
[01:32:45] He said weak leaders weak. Yeah
[01:32:48] I think that was a general term, but yeah, I got squats, bro
[01:32:51] I agree. He didn't say do squats or curls. He didn't say guys or girls do squats
[01:32:56] But there's an inferred kind of implied thing that we all kind of heard right? Yeah, yeah
[01:33:01] Yeah, let's face it if you're not doing squats, it doesn't sound like he'd kind of dig you that much given the whole nature
[01:33:07] Uh of the whole deal
[01:33:09] I get it but for those of us who are doing squats, which is pretty much all of us. Am I right?
[01:33:14] Uh, we got some some supplementation for you, you know through this path a lot of pain in this path not pain
[01:33:19] So they discover discomfort pain no suffering
[01:33:24] Wait, is that pain? No suffering. No suffering. No, no, no, there's pain
[01:33:27] But there's no suffering because suffering is like your meat the meaning of pain or like what the meaning you put on the pain that you get
[01:33:34] I think that's like the suffering
[01:33:36] Yeah, like dom's pain not suffering
[01:33:41] Tear your bicep
[01:33:43] Pain and suffering. Yeah, because you can't do curls
[01:33:47] Seems I understand what I'm saying. I guess man. I'm not sure 100 I'm tracking you, but I don't really want to know
[01:33:53] No, no, this is important because it can actually uh
[01:33:56] Help diminish some of your suffering if you understand this
[01:34:00] Okay, this is what I learned
[01:34:02] Equal echo Charles coming in hot. What do you got?
[01:34:05] So pain and suffering are two different things suffering is just like what you uh, basically the conclusion you make given the pain that you have
[01:34:12] So if it's like, um, if you think your pain is like bad, it's for the negative. It's destroying you. It's whatever then that that
[01:34:19] illicit suffering
[01:34:21] But if you say hey, this is part of the process that I need or that I have embraced or whatever
[01:34:26] It's still pain, but it's not suffering. See I'm saying
[01:34:30] Yeah, okay
[01:34:30] And so you can assign meaning to whatever you want including pain and you can assign whatever meaning you want to anything
[01:34:36] It's sort of like building a palace instead of a lean to so I could be feeling pain and be like this is part of be building the palace
[01:34:42] Or I could be feeling the pain going dude. This is horrible
[01:34:45] I can I'm not gonna be able to sleep here tonight because I gotta lean to exactly right
[01:34:49] All right, see so you do understand it's true
[01:34:52] either way
[01:34:53] When you do feel this pain eliminate the suffering you got some supplementation will help you for real
[01:34:58] Basically add physically. Yeah the monk. That's it. Yeah, that's a big one because if you don't get your protein
[01:35:03] Which is hard to do by the way, we established that long time ago
[01:35:06] It is hard to do just to just eat food and get the amount of protein that we're gonna need
[01:35:11] It's true. Yeah, yeah, but not anymore. Not now that we have moch. Yeah, I'm saying and it tastes good
[01:35:17] Um the marketing guys
[01:35:20] Are like well the thing is with the moch name. We got to explain what it is
[01:35:26] Yeah, moch additional protein in the form of a dessert. That's the problem. Not that hard, dude. No, no, so there you go
[01:35:32] Yeah, what is moch and we couldn't just call it a protein thing because it tastes too good
[01:35:36] Yeah, it doesn't have the it might have the stigma of like a bro. Yeah, something. Yeah, if I said hey
[01:35:42] Do you want this broccoli? But the broccoli tasted but the broccoli tasted like
[01:35:49] Like really good. Yeah, it tasted like really good like key. Would I call it broccoli? No, I'd call it something else
[01:35:55] Yeah, if I said hey, do you want all the goodness of broccoli, but it tastes really delicious what I call it broccoli
[01:36:02] I understand what you mean. Yeah, so if I make a
[01:36:05] Thing that's got protein in it a bunch of really good protein
[01:36:08] And it's really good for you, but it doesn't taste like your typical trash
[01:36:13] Then why would we call a protein we call a moch had to have its own word
[01:36:17] Okay, so Dave Burke didn't let me tell you or let me ask you what you think about this
[01:36:21] so
[01:36:22] I drink moch chocolate most of the time seem saying
[01:36:26] But so sometimes I want to make coffee. I make a mocha. Right. You put that's a little bit of chocolate milk in the in the coffee
[01:36:33] Right, that's a mocha
[01:36:34] Oh wait or chocolate whatever chocolate chocolate milk, whatever. What if I put the chocolate?
[01:36:39] Mulk in the coffee. That's a mocha
[01:36:42] You see you
[01:36:44] So now
[01:36:45] And this is my question to Dave Burke if there was a nut do you drink coffee right sometimes? No
[01:36:49] Oh, bro. That's not even oh this question not for you then for my people then who drink coffee
[01:36:54] If there was a
[01:36:56] Mulk flavored coffee chocolate called mocha with caffeine
[01:37:01] Would that be viable?
[01:37:03] You're gonna get a lot of yeses on that because I'm getting hit up for that. I think so too. Yeah, right?
[01:37:08] Because there's there's things like that that are out there, but they're not good for you
[01:37:11] There's downside a lot of downside a lot of sugar a lot of crap in it
[01:37:15] So there's things like that exist, but they're not
[01:37:19] Clean right that's what I'm saying. So
[01:37:22] So what if this right here right moch rtd ready to drink?
[01:37:28] chocolate flavored
[01:37:29] What if we'd added some coffee flavored?
[01:37:33] Or just some coffee in there. See what I'm saying. Yeah, like ice coffee in there. There's demand signal for that 100%
[01:37:39] Bro, I think I could get down with that. I know you could that sounds like a really cool idea
[01:37:48] I see what you're saying. That's what you're saying, but I do know the team we we are very close
[01:37:52] You know what I'll give you for your idea one dollar. Oh, I don't yeah. I don't want to know
[01:37:56] Oh, no, all good. It's a fantasy right now. It's just a fantasy fantasy. No worth nothing
[01:38:01] But I do know a group of people who can ever have somebody present an idea to you that they made you like sign an nda
[01:38:07] And then they presented but them no but then they present the idea and you're like, bro
[01:38:10] This is the dope or or this is the most obvious thing that like
[01:38:13] Is like why I can't believe you're you're presenting this. Yeah, so I know you guys were laughing both of you laughing at me or whatever
[01:38:20] When I brought this up
[01:38:21] But all that stuff that I said about the ideas in the you know, the cancer pill and all that's from a from a series of real stories
[01:38:28] That actually happened to me. Oh, yeah
[01:38:30] Wait the actual cancer pill thing. No, no, no, cancer pill was my rebuttal to like the person saying how good their idea
[01:38:36] How valuable is it was an nda day? By the way, not to mention
[01:38:40] Oh, uh, let's meet up at this coffee shop and like I want to really present breath. Hold on. Oh, yeah
[01:38:45] It's so annoying after ask my brother. He makes apps. So he's like
[01:38:49] Yeah, really in that game or whatever. But yeah, when we when I made websites, bro, you especially back in what oh
[01:38:56] Eight, yeah
[01:38:57] Everyone in their mom had ideas for a website
[01:39:00] Problem have a website where it does this and that and this and that nda
[01:39:04] Sign it because I don't want you to steal my idea. Yep. See what I'm saying
[01:39:10] But this mocha idea is very executable. Yep. No, no, that's that's probably that's gonna happen. I'll say that
[01:39:16] I'll say that. So there you go. Uh, drcoffuel.com. Get mocha. Get get get some discipline go
[01:39:22] Energy, you know, that's another thing like it's called an energy drink, but there's no downside
[01:39:26] So it's not really
[01:39:28] In the same category actually they're kind of having a new category of healthy energy drinks
[01:39:32] Based on the drink that we made damn like some of the retailers that we work with
[01:39:37] They're making a new category area. It's like, you know, oh, you can get this junk poison
[01:39:41] Yeah, that'll give you a 30 minute a 38 minute freaking
[01:39:46] Methanphetamines freak rush and then you'll crash and burn and be
[01:39:51] You have type 2 diabetes or you can just take one aisle over and here we are this thing's clean and makes you feel good
[01:39:58] I wonder if they'd put it one on one aisle over though
[01:40:03] They put it right next to it. It's like I mean, I shouldn't say aisle one shelf over
[01:40:07] Oh, yeah, like one little section over. Yeah, like this one says poison. It's got a skull and crossbones
[01:40:13] Like a radioactive thing and then this one says healthy. It's got like
[01:40:16] Like a strong muscle
[01:40:18] Like a flexed arm a life force logo or something like this life force logo. Is that a thing?
[01:40:23] Oh, okay. Maybe you need to make one. That's the beginning of my idea. Oh, that's a good idea life force life force logo
[01:40:29] Yeah, yeah, but it's true though. Yeah, you're over there create logos on a bunch of ideas too. You know what I'm saying
[01:40:35] I'll get the website soon. That's another part of that process. Oh, I already brought the domain
[01:40:41] You know url's I own I own url's, you know, like, you know life force
[01:40:46] Calm it's like just ran. I'm probably gonna buy that in the next three minutes. Probably somebody already bought it
[01:40:51] so the url domain name is like
[01:40:55] 1% better than the idea
[01:40:58] Maybe 10% because ideas are close to zero. Yeah, what's close to zero, but the url is like
[01:41:02] I think literally like I mean you can get a url for for $9.99 on
[01:41:09] Go Daddy is Go Daddy the one that does that? No, no, no, no, plenty plenty plenty spots domain.com
[01:41:15] Go Daddy freaking there's one called the main it. Yeah, there's a lot of places. It's called a register
[01:41:20] Is Go Daddy the big the big one? Yeah, that's one of the main ones for sure. That's all my all my stuff is Go Daddy
[01:41:26] Yeah, do you ever look at because you got access to my go do you ever look on there and go like
[01:41:29] Well, I wonder what this idiot was thinking here with freaking no w w w dot
[01:41:34] planting rocks in the world
[01:41:36] Comments the thing is that sounds funny to you. But to me I see all those I say, okay, I see what he was
[01:41:42] I see where he was going because you look at mine. You're gonna be like, bro. What the hell is this guy thinking, bro? You
[01:41:48] You haven't you haven't lived
[01:41:51] Give me your worst domain name that you own if I can't I don't know it offhand
[01:41:55] But a lot of them have expired too, but right that's that's back in the day when I used to stay up drinking and stuff and doing like
[01:42:02] quote-unquote creative stuff
[01:42:05] For 999
[01:42:08] And like I said earlier, you have the whole dream in your head. Oh, yeah, play out the whole thing
[01:42:13] And here's the thing it was it was bad with me for myself
[01:42:16] I didn't go to other people saying like hey you do the you know, I just like you do the rest
[01:42:20] That was a violation you woke up in the morning how to do the walk of shame back to your computer to see what your go daddy bill was
[01:42:26] You're right. That's the funny thing. You're 100 right when you're like, what did I do last night?
[01:42:31] I'm so dumb like looking at these things like what was I thinking? I think
[01:42:35] But the what made it bad for me
[01:42:38] Is when I drink I'd be like wait a second
[01:42:40] I could do I could literally pull this off this little idea that I have like I know how to make websites
[01:42:44] I don't want to make video. I know I used to go through the line of assets that you bring to the whole project
[01:42:49] Yeah, and then you do it and you're like proud no one's gonna your cash
[01:42:53] You're all but cash and checks like all but checking into the academy awards for your movies. It's true url
[01:43:00] True. All right. So there is a url that has proved out to be pretty valuable. It's called jocofuel.com
[01:43:06] Which is one that you know what I just kind of grabbed
[01:43:10] Right as the whole idea came to fruition
[01:43:13] You want to hear something really you might already know this but try go on go daddy or wherever and go look for urls
[01:43:21] containing jocos something like something real like I don't know jocomicrophones or a jocobottle or I don't know something
