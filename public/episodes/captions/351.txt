[00:02:31] Master Sergeant Marcosana had a wife
[00:02:34] and three children, Riley, Andrew, and Madeline.
[00:02:40] And his friends that served with him alongside him
[00:02:44] called him the real Captain America.
[00:02:51] And in early July, 2020,
[00:02:53] he sent some of those friends a message.
[00:02:58] He said, text me.
[00:03:00] I told you before, my door's open.
[00:03:02] My phone is at hand.
[00:03:04] We did things that people make movies about
[00:03:06] and in some cases, writers and producers
[00:03:09] wouldn't even try to write our story.
[00:03:14] But the Rucksack is heavy.
[00:03:16] And when it gets heavy, we help each other.
[00:03:20] But you have to reach out.
[00:03:23] Don't let the valley win.
[00:03:31] So that's Andrew Marcosano.
[00:03:34] The kind of guy that we all look up to.
[00:03:44] Kind of guy that's looking out for us.
[00:03:46] Kind of guy that we see as strong and unflappable.
[00:03:52] Kind of guy that's helping others
[00:03:55] and of course couldn't possibly need any help himself.
[00:03:59] But a few days after sending that message
[00:04:02] to his friends and comrades on July 6th, 2020,
[00:04:07] Andy Marcosano killed himself.
[00:04:18] Which is a nightmare.
[00:04:22] And it's only one of thousands of these cases.
[00:04:31] And we've talked about some of them on this podcast.
[00:04:33] We talked to Sarah Wilkinson about her husband Chad,
[00:04:39] who committed suicide after multiple combat deployments
[00:04:42] with the SEAL teams.
[00:04:43] We talked with Mike Hayes.
[00:04:44] We talked to Mike Hayes.
[00:04:46] We talked to Mike Hayes.
[00:04:48] We talked to Mike Hayes.
[00:04:50] We talked to Mike Hayes about a friend of ours
[00:04:53] named Joe Price, another SEAL.
[00:04:57] This one who killed himself in the middle of a deployment.
[00:05:06] And the list goes on and on in every branch.
[00:05:08] And it's not a new problem.
[00:05:10] On this podcast, we discussed Charles White, Wittlesley.
[00:05:15] Medal of Honor recipient, World War I,
[00:05:20] who killed himself after returning home.
[00:05:27] We discussed the awful suicide of Lewis Puller Jr.,
[00:05:31] son of Chesty Puller,
[00:05:35] who was wounded in Vietnam and fought off the darkness
[00:05:39] for 25 years before finally losing his battle with the demons.
[00:05:53] But there are people that overcome.
[00:05:58] There are people that find a way to push through
[00:06:02] and push on and begin to truly live again.
[00:06:09] And there are many ways to get there.
[00:06:12] And tonight, it's an honor to have Amber and Marcus Capone
[00:06:19] with us, two people who have found a path.
[00:06:25] A path out of the darkness, a path toward the light,
[00:06:28] and they're doing their best to show them
[00:06:30] a path toward the light, and they're doing their best
[00:06:32] to share it with as many people as they can.
[00:06:35] Marcus was a seal.
[00:06:37] For 13 years, completed multiple deployments overseas,
[00:06:44] and his wife, Amber, also here, who stuck with him
[00:06:51] through all that and much more.
[00:06:53] And from everything I can tell,
[00:06:56] she eventually saved him from himself.
[00:07:00] Amber, Marcus, thanks for coming on.
[00:07:06] I know it's a heavy topic, and I know you are
[00:07:08] in the trenches every day dealing with this
[00:07:10] and trying to help people out.
[00:07:12] So thanks for coming on here to share your story
[00:07:16] and hopefully guide some other people in the right direction.
[00:07:20] I guess we just start at the beginning.
[00:07:23] I guess start with Marcus, your childhood,
[00:07:28] where'd you grow up, what was that all about?
[00:07:31] Well first, thanks for that introduction.
[00:07:33] That was, wow.
[00:07:35] Just, wow.
[00:07:37] Yeah, one of my most, you know,
[00:07:41] every single Marine knows who Chesty Puller is.
[00:07:45] Probably the most iconic Marine of all time,
[00:07:48] if not, he's definitely in the top two or three.
[00:07:51] And yet no one knows about his son.
[00:07:54] Or, I shouldn't say no one, very few people know about his son.
[00:07:57] And it's, I think it's one of the most tragic stories in history
[00:08:03] about what happened to his son.
[00:08:05] And Lewis Puller Jr. coming out of Vietnam,
[00:08:09] so severely wounded, but I mean, he kind of got it together
[00:08:14] eventually and wrote a Pulitzer Prize winning book,
[00:08:17] which is an incredible book.
[00:08:18] And it just kind of fell apart at the end.
[00:08:22] And we should, that should be, you know,
[00:08:26] people should know at least as much about him
[00:08:28] as they do about his dad.
[00:08:30] Because if that's not a warning, then I don't know what is.
[00:08:34] Yeah, Jaco, I think that's a good point.
[00:08:38] And that story in particular is that, you know,
[00:08:41] I'm good right now and guys are good,
[00:08:43] but it took him, you know, 25 years.
[00:08:46] You know, he wrote Pulitzer Prize book,
[00:08:49] seemed like he was okay,
[00:08:51] but I feel we've all come to this point
[00:08:54] and even, you know, you go do this treatment
[00:08:57] that we're going to talk about.
[00:08:59] It doesn't mean you're healed forever.
[00:09:01] You don't go to the gym or go downstairs to work out
[00:09:03] and think you're going to be a black belt for a day
[00:09:05] or you're trying every day, right?
[00:09:07] And so I think in this healing process,
[00:09:09] it's, you know, I don't want to call us damaged,
[00:09:12] but we came to a point where we needed some help
[00:09:14] to climb out of some darkness.
[00:09:16] And so I have to work on it every day,
[00:09:18] literally every day, probably forever.
[00:09:21] And so I, you know, you mentioning that story,
[00:09:24] I think it's important for people to hear like,
[00:09:26] this is not a one and done, there's not a panacea.
[00:09:29] You know, this is forever, right?
[00:09:31] And this is forever.
[00:09:32] And so we got to work on ourselves every day forever.
[00:09:35] Otherwise, you know, we don't want to end up,
[00:09:38] you know, underground too early.
[00:09:41] Yeah.
[00:09:45] So let's talk about how you got here,
[00:09:47] how you got here sitting here today.
[00:09:49] Where'd you grow up?
[00:09:50] Yeah.
[00:09:51] So I was born in Queens, New York.
[00:09:54] I moved to the island when I was at Long Island,
[00:09:57] when I was three.
[00:09:58] And, you know, I thought I was just like a typical Long Island kid.
[00:10:05] I played everything, you know, my dad and my grandfather
[00:10:09] both played college sports, basketball, baseball, football.
[00:10:14] So I literally, I think I had a ball in my hand at, you know,
[00:10:18] two or three years old.
[00:10:19] I was on skis at three.
[00:10:21] I was in the water at four.
[00:10:24] We had one of the top wrestling programs in New York.
[00:10:28] And so I was like on a mat at like seven, you know,
[00:10:30] in most of those places you didn't get to wrestle
[00:10:32] like junior high or maybe even high school.
[00:10:34] And so, you know, I was lucky.
[00:10:37] And I grew up in a beach town in Long Beach, New York.
[00:10:40] And so, you know, I was always in the water, always on the beach.
[00:10:43] I was a lifeguard at 16.
[00:10:46] Yeah, I mean, I thought life was good.
[00:10:48] And, you know, I know that sounds like a pretty freaking good life.
[00:10:51] No, I mean, it was good.
[00:10:52] At least I thought it was good.
[00:10:54] Both your, both your, your, your dad and your granddad were athletes.
[00:10:59] When you said like, yeah, they were athletes.
[00:11:01] My, my grandfather was an all state basketball player.
[00:11:05] And he was a white dude too from New York, which is, you know, play basketball.
[00:11:09] And I mean, I'll brag.
[00:11:11] I think New York's got some of the best basketball in the world.
[00:11:14] So, you know, we, we played, played in tough leagues.
[00:11:17] And then my dad was more football and baseball.
[00:11:21] So he, he started as a freshman in high school,
[00:11:25] which was huge in the Catholic high school league.
[00:11:27] So I went to all boys Catholic high school where he went Holy Cross and fleshing.
[00:11:31] There's a shout out.
[00:11:33] And, yeah, so I just, I'm caught out for that all boys scenario.
[00:11:37] Yeah.
[00:11:38] Well, maybe it's why I'm here today.
[00:11:40] Who knows?
[00:11:42] Hey, what about like grades and stuff?
[00:11:44] Were you doing good in school?
[00:11:45] I was, I was good in school.
[00:11:46] I was really good up until high school and I slipped a little bit.
[00:11:51] So I was like a straight,
[00:11:52] Were you still in an all boys school in high school?
[00:11:54] Yeah.
[00:11:55] High school was all boys.
[00:11:56] So I went to public grammar and middle school in Long Island.
[00:11:59] And then I went to all boys Catholic high school in back in New York.
[00:12:03] So I took the train for an hour every day.
[00:12:05] The football coach at the time would pick me up in Valley Stream.
[00:12:10] So what year is this?
[00:12:11] So this is 90,
[00:12:13] Like what year do you graduate from?
[00:12:14] 94.
[00:12:15] Okay.
[00:12:16] Yeah.
[00:12:17] And so, yeah, I would, I would take the train at like 5.50 in the morning.
[00:12:21] He'd pick me up at 6.30 the coach and then he'd drive me in the rest of the way.
[00:12:26] So that was just normal back then.
[00:12:29] You know, some people don't understand it now,
[00:12:32] but the Catholic high school league in everything was good.
[00:12:37] And I didn't, I grew up in a town that didn't have a great public high school.
[00:12:41] And again, I was, you know, I was all about sports.
[00:12:45] So wherever they had the best sports, I was, I was going, I was going.
[00:12:49] What'd your dad do for a living?
[00:12:51] Um, you know, he, he kind of just a bit of a hustler really never,
[00:12:58] um, never finished college.
[00:13:00] Men's a smart though.
[00:13:02] Super smart.
[00:13:03] You know, it was really into the market and, but just never applied himself.
[00:13:06] Um, he, uh, he wind up, I think the last 20 years, he was a bridge operator.
[00:13:14] So he literally open and close a drawbridge in the county and, you know,
[00:13:19] he worked for the county and had benefits.
[00:13:22] The funny thing is whenever my, I think my uncle Shane asked me,
[00:13:27] what does Marcus's dad do?
[00:13:29] And I asked you or asked him or something and he goes,
[00:13:32] tell him I work for the union.
[00:13:34] Just leave it at that.
[00:13:35] Yeah.
[00:13:36] For the union.
[00:13:37] Well, he used to tell people he was a bridge engineer.
[00:13:41] It sounded better than telling him that he was, uh, opening and closing a drawbridge.
[00:13:45] And, um, and then on the side, he moonlighted.
[00:13:49] He, um, he drove for people.
[00:13:51] So he would drive for, um, elected officials.
[00:13:56] Yeah.
[00:13:57] But, um, who I'm, I'm drawing a blank from New York.
[00:14:01] Some like governor.
[00:14:02] Yeah.
[00:14:03] Yeah.
[00:14:04] You know, just a few like kind of local.
[00:14:06] So he had like a link, he had like a town Lincoln town car and he was getting out.
[00:14:09] Literally had a square Lincoln town car that was handed down to me.
[00:14:13] Yeah.
[00:14:14] And he was like, Hey, sucked gas.
[00:14:16] It was awesome.
[00:14:17] I love that thing.
[00:14:19] Hey, what about your mom?
[00:14:20] Lincoln town car.
[00:14:21] Was she around?
[00:14:22] You hit it right on the head.
[00:14:23] Yeah.
[00:14:24] Yeah.
[00:14:25] Mom worked for a dentist for over 30 years.
[00:14:26] So she was, uh, she was at the front answering the phone, you know, paying the bills, greeting
[00:14:31] everyone.
[00:14:32] So I had free, free dental growing up, which is nice.
[00:14:35] Right.
[00:14:36] And what about brothers and sisters?
[00:14:37] None.
[00:14:38] You're only child.
[00:14:39] I was only child.
[00:14:40] I had a, I have a half sister I've never met.
[00:14:42] Um, and well, I can't remember.
[00:14:47] Well, I mean, I, I mean, I've never, I can't, I don't remember that.
[00:14:51] So it was like lesson one when I think they separated us.
[00:14:54] But, uh, you know, then that was just me.
[00:14:56] So spoiled, spoiled only child.
[00:14:58] And the focus was just on sports.
[00:15:00] It was all on sports and, you know, in academics, my dad was, he was an academic and, you know,
[00:15:06] I would literally get like backhanded if I came home with like, you know, a B.
[00:15:11] That's the part of his childhood.
[00:15:13] Yeah.
[00:15:14] It's the part that, you know, that may not have been very, very hard dad.
[00:15:17] Yeah.
[00:15:18] Dad was hard, right?
[00:15:19] So, um,
[00:15:20] What do you think was driving that in your dad?
[00:15:21] Cause it sounds like he's kind of laid back in a way or is he just pouring all of his
[00:15:24] dreams into you?
[00:15:25] I think that I think you hit it.
[00:15:27] I think you hit that on that.
[00:15:28] Yeah.
[00:15:29] My parents went to Woodstock.
[00:15:30] I mean, they were like, they were like hippies, sort of hippies, you know, mom used to protest
[00:15:33] the war.
[00:15:34] Um, but yeah, he had like a real mean side and his grant, his dad, my grandfather was
[00:15:40] a cleaner.
[00:15:41] Um, I think he told me what before noon, he'd already, he would already drank like two
[00:15:46] quarts of beer, you know, quarts back in the day.
[00:15:49] Um, and then he owned, they owned, uh, like his family owned a bunch of the, um, I guess
[00:15:54] a medallion like a cabs in New York.
[00:15:56] Oh yeah.
[00:15:57] You know, components from New York, right?
[00:15:59] Um, and so I don't know how he was treated as a kid.
[00:16:02] Well, I'll tell you how he was sent away to boarding school.
[00:16:06] All boys.
[00:16:07] This is your dad.
[00:16:08] This is my dad in the Bronx at four years old.
[00:16:13] So I mean, if you and I think back at four kind of love we had from our parents, his
[00:16:18] sent him away, uh, to Catholic boarding school in the Bronx.
[00:16:23] And I could just imagine what went on there from, you know, some of the, some of the individuals
[00:16:30] that, you know, we're hearing about now all these stories these days.
[00:16:33] So maybe he had some shit, uh, that he was, he was getting out on me, um, possibly.
[00:16:39] But he, but it sounds like he just wanted you to be successful in a big way.
[00:16:44] It was all about me.
[00:16:45] Yeah.
[00:16:46] He like, they hung up their life to, he was at every practice literally, um, you know,
[00:16:52] right there, cheering, watching.
[00:16:54] Did he yell at the ref?
[00:16:56] Yelling.
[00:16:57] No, that was my mom.
[00:16:58] Okay.
[00:16:59] So no, he would, he would backhand me if, if something just didn't seem right.
[00:17:03] And she would get thrown out of the little league world series because she was screaming
[00:17:08] at the freaking umpire about a call and they actually did get thrown out.
[00:17:12] Like she had to leave the stadium in the little league.
[00:17:15] I say hell yeah.
[00:17:16] I like people, I don't know why people get the impression that I would like be, uh, yelling
[00:17:21] and screaming, but I'd never like for my kids played sports.
[00:17:24] I would just, I wouldn't say anything.
[00:17:26] I wouldn't even coach them.
[00:17:27] I wouldn't even, but well, maybe occasionally.
[00:17:29] But most of the time I would just sit there and watch because it's hard to coach your
[00:17:32] own kids, man.
[00:17:33] They don't, they don't really want to listen to you.
[00:17:36] So no, no, no matter how much you know, you're just telling me the story downstairs.
[00:17:40] Yeah.
[00:17:41] Yeah.
[00:17:42] Yeah.
[00:17:43] I was telling him, my son was doing Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:17:45] I've been doing Jiu-Jitsu at this point.
[00:17:46] I've been doing Jiu-Jitsu for like 25 years and my son, I'm watching him roll and he's
[00:17:50] got an arm lock on somebody and I say, Hey, you know, you need to get your hips a little
[00:17:54] further underneath that elbow.
[00:17:55] And he looks at me and he goes, No, you don't.
[00:17:57] Okay, fair enough.
[00:17:59] Oh, bastard.
[00:18:00] I'm not going to listen to anything.
[00:18:03] But so you, your grades are good.
[00:18:06] Yeah.
[00:18:07] You sound like a freaking good model kid.
[00:18:09] I was a good kid, but I think that was the problem too.
[00:18:11] I was like, I was, I was, I was too nice.
[00:18:14] I'm still a little too nice.
[00:18:16] But yeah, so I got, you know, I was skinny too.
[00:18:19] So I was skinny, nice kid that also got put ahead, not held back like, like we do in Texas.
[00:18:26] We hold back our kids.
[00:18:27] We hold back in Texas.
[00:18:28] The kids like 17 years old, grown as fresh.
[00:18:30] Absolutely.
[00:18:31] Well, I mean, I mean, you have to, our son graduated with someone who was turning 20.
[00:18:34] Yeah.
[00:18:35] I mean, you have to, you know, you have to pass for 3000 yards, you know, they call
[00:18:39] the Texas gray shirt.
[00:18:41] No, instead I got put ahead early for whatever reason.
[00:18:45] And so I was with older kids, skinny, nice kid.
[00:18:50] And yeah, I got, I definitely got abused.
[00:18:54] Just picked on, picked on constantly.
[00:18:56] What kind of music?
[00:18:57] I think some people call that right of passage.
[00:18:58] I think there's a little bit of both.
[00:19:00] But it wasn't fun.
[00:19:02] What kind of music did you like?
[00:19:05] Growing up in New York, like Queens, everything, rap, like Beastie Boys, right from Brooklyn.
[00:19:17] Guns and Roses.
[00:19:19] So just you kind of normal music for late 80s, early 90s, get some.
[00:19:26] Yeah.
[00:19:27] And then I got into like some other stuff in high school, like trying to think like kind
[00:19:33] of Lollapalooza, ESC, music, Pro Jam, you know, everything that was coming out of Seattle.
[00:19:39] So all that stuff was good.
[00:19:41] Cause that stuff made it mainstream in the early 90s.
[00:19:44] So you could, you could pick up on it.
[00:19:45] Yeah.
[00:19:46] Even in a big, big, big, big, school.
[00:19:48] All boys school.
[00:19:49] Boys Catholic High School and Queens.
[00:19:53] And was all this geared towards you going to college to play sports?
[00:19:55] Yes.
[00:19:56] It actually was.
[00:19:57] That's all we talked about.
[00:19:58] I mean, that's all I knew.
[00:19:59] Were you going to camps?
[00:20:00] I was going to camps every summer from the, I can't even remember, Jack, that's how I
[00:20:07] fought back.
[00:20:08] I was either in a basketball camp or a football camp at Fordham or a baseball camp, junior
[00:20:17] lifeguards, like just all that shit.
[00:20:19] Yeah.
[00:20:20] And what, what did you, what sport did you like the best?
[00:20:22] I liked football.
[00:20:23] And is that, is that the one you were best at as well?
[00:20:26] That's the one I was best at.
[00:20:27] I played in college for her dad.
[00:20:29] We'll get into that later.
[00:20:30] But yeah, I got full scholarship to play.
[00:20:33] Definitely beat your body up, of course, but I just, I don't know, it was one of those
[00:20:36] things I liked.
[00:20:38] I was a quarterback from, I think like seven years old.
[00:20:43] And you know, I think it was up to me.
[00:20:46] I'd probably be surfing and I tried because we, because we did live in a beach town and
[00:20:50] my dad was like not having it at all.
[00:20:53] So I would try to surf and then immediately like we'd go right into, you know, some kind
[00:20:58] of camp or, you know, baseball double headers in Brooklyn, you know, at 90 degrees in the
[00:21:04] middle of summer type shit.
[00:21:07] Check.
[00:21:08] All right.
[00:21:09] Amber, your turn.
[00:21:10] Well, I entered the picture at the football juncture where my dad recruited him, but prior
[00:21:16] to that, you must have been doing something prior to that.
[00:21:19] What were you doing?
[00:21:20] Yeah.
[00:21:21] Prior to that, I grew up in a really small town in Southern Illinois.
[00:21:23] So everyone, when I say I'm from Illinois, I think Chicago, but I've actually only been
[00:21:27] to Chicago one time in my life.
[00:21:30] I grew up on a retired dairy farm in a very rural part of Illinois.
[00:21:36] Retired dairy farm, meaning there's no more cows there.
[00:21:38] Yeah.
[00:21:39] It's not, there's, there was, all the barns were still there.
[00:21:42] The milk house was there.
[00:21:43] The farm house was there.
[00:21:45] All the land was there.
[00:21:46] Was it your family's that retired it?
[00:21:49] Yes.
[00:21:50] Great grandfather, great, great and great grandfathers were the milk men of my county.
[00:21:57] And then they shut it down at some point.
[00:22:00] Yeah.
[00:22:01] So they had, I don't even know how many, you know, hundreds of cows.
[00:22:03] My grandfather worked the farm whenever he was in high school.
[00:22:07] And then at some point shortly thereafter, he was like their farmhand and he ended up
[00:22:12] going to college and getting married to my grandmother.
[00:22:15] And I think at some point they retired it after that.
[00:22:18] And did your dad have to work on the dairy farm at all or was it already done?
[00:22:21] That was my mom's dad.
[00:22:23] My dad's dad owned an excavating business.
[00:22:26] Oh, God.
[00:22:27] And yes, my dad and his brothers worked the tractors.
[00:22:30] So I come from a very hardworking family.
[00:22:32] Yeah, dairy farmers, that's a hard life, man.
[00:22:36] Yeah.
[00:22:37] It's a hard life.
[00:22:38] But like a really good wholesome life.
[00:22:40] And I just grew up in a really wholesome family and a really wholesome town.
[00:22:45] And my dad being a football coach just really always drove me, loved me, but drove me.
[00:22:54] And like he, the one thing he taught me was don't you ever quit anything.
[00:23:00] Don't ever quit.
[00:23:01] And so, you know, it didn't matter how uncomfortable things got in my mind.
[00:23:06] I'm like, I'm not quitting.
[00:23:07] I don't have a quit in me.
[00:23:09] Did you play sports?
[00:23:10] I was a cheerleader.
[00:23:11] Right.
[00:23:12] I would have been more athletic had my dad been in my life, my parents.
[00:23:18] He was in my life, but not in like a dad way.
[00:23:21] You know, he was, my parents were divorced.
[00:23:23] So I saw him spring break, a couple of months during the summer, over Christmas.
[00:23:29] But you know, day to day I was raised by my mom.
[00:23:32] And how long did you cheerleading for?
[00:23:35] From the time I was in seventh grade to senior in high school.
[00:23:41] Damn.
[00:23:42] So you were out there.
[00:23:43] Yeah.
[00:23:44] I remember I was working and my middle daughter, she did gymnastics and then she, that's like
[00:23:50] a little, there's a little, there's a little off ramp or a little on ramp to cheerleading.
[00:23:54] Right.
[00:23:55] And so she was doing gymnastics.
[00:23:57] Then she got on that little ramp and, you know, it's kind of like, dang it.
[00:24:01] You know, like it just doesn't seem like it's the thing that you want your daughter to do,
[00:24:06] at least for me, right.
[00:24:08] And then two things happened.
[00:24:10] One of them was this woman CEO that I worked with, who's an awesome woman.
[00:24:15] I told her, I was like, yeah, you know, my daughter's doing cheerleading.
[00:24:18] She's going to do cheerleading.
[00:24:20] And this woman's like, I did cheerleading and it was awesome.
[00:24:23] And I was like, really?
[00:24:24] She goes, yeah, you're out there.
[00:24:25] You're standing in front of people.
[00:24:26] You're projecting your voice.
[00:24:27] And I was like, okay, fair enough.
[00:24:28] And my daughter only did it for a couple of years.
[00:24:31] Then she's, then she got more committed to wrestling.
[00:24:34] Yes.
[00:24:35] Which was awesome.
[00:24:39] And another thing that happened was one of my buddies was also had a daughter who was
[00:24:45] also doing cheerleading.
[00:24:49] And he's like, he's kind of making fun of me.
[00:24:52] He goes, oh, you're letting your daughter do cheerleading.
[00:24:54] My daughter's doing cheerleading, but he's going to make fun of me because I guess I don't
[00:24:57] seem like the cheerleading type of dad.
[00:24:59] And he goes, oh, you're letting your daughter do cheerleading.
[00:25:02] And I go, yeah, you know, I figure I either let her do cheerleading or she comes home
[00:25:06] with a tattoo on her face when she's like 18.
[00:25:08] Right?
[00:25:09] Cause that's what happens.
[00:25:10] You like pressure your kids or you like steer them or you prevent them from doing something.
[00:25:14] They're going to rebel hard against you and then up on the wrong path.
[00:25:16] So anyways, she did cheerleading for a little bit.
[00:25:19] All good.
[00:25:20] And did you do good in school?
[00:25:22] Oh yeah.
[00:25:23] I was pretty much a straight A student.
[00:25:26] Did you, what did you want to do when you grew up?
[00:25:28] Did you, did you want to go to college?
[00:25:29] Like what was the deal?
[00:25:30] So my parents were both raised in this really small town.
[00:25:34] They were in the same class together and had this sort of crush on each other since they
[00:25:39] were in third grade all the way through, you know, junior high school, high school prom,
[00:25:44] king and queen, captain of the football team, captain of the cheerleading team.
[00:25:48] Like, you know, they, everything was my two, two sides of the family in this one little
[00:25:54] town, but my dad had these big aspirations to be a football coach.
[00:25:58] And so he actually got a full ride to University of Illinois and that's where he ended up going
[00:26:07] for his first coaching, you know, his first coaching gig.
[00:26:11] And from that point on, when he got out of that little town, he always said to me, you
[00:26:17] get out of here as soon as you can.
[00:26:19] Dang.
[00:26:20] Cause he knew that, you know, there wasn't the opportunity for me there that I would
[00:26:25] need to have, you know, that he wanted me to have in life.
[00:26:29] I don't think he thought Marcus would be my ticket out of there, but, you know, he helped
[00:26:35] facilitate that.
[00:26:36] All right.
[00:26:37] So let's get to that.
[00:26:38] So you ended up getting recruited to go play football.
[00:26:40] I did at Southern Illinois.
[00:26:42] And your dad was the head coach there?
[00:26:45] Yeah.
[00:26:46] So at that point he'd been from U of I, he went to Miami of Ohio and then got the head
[00:26:52] football coaching job at Southern Illinois University and that was about 10 minutes from
[00:26:56] this little town that I grew up in.
[00:26:58] So he was 34 years old and he was the head coach of, you know, our hometown team.
[00:27:04] Yeah.
[00:27:05] Big school of 25,000 students.
[00:27:06] It was division one.
[00:27:07] Yeah.
[00:27:08] Now it's, it's, the enrollment's really gone down significantly, like a lot of schools,
[00:27:13] but it was, it was, you know, it was a large school back then.
[00:27:16] And you roll in, you get recruited D one.
[00:27:18] Yeah.
[00:27:19] And so I got hurt in high school.
[00:27:23] So I wound up not playing my senior year.
[00:27:25] What was the injury?
[00:27:26] I tore a couple of ligaments in my wrist, my throwing wrist, tried to play through it
[00:27:31] for a couple of years and they never actually know whatever knew it was torn.
[00:27:34] I just kept having this, like I'd land on it wrong and, you know, have this like screaming
[00:27:40] pain.
[00:27:41] Finally got an MRI and they're like, yeah, you're, you have several torn ligaments.
[00:27:45] Like that's why you're in pain.
[00:27:47] So I said, we can do surgery now.
[00:27:51] You'll miss football season, but you'll be back for baseball season or you can play
[00:27:55] football season and then have surgery after, but you'd miss baseball season.
[00:28:00] And so just chatting with, you know, dad, I was excelling more in baseball and we decided,
[00:28:08] you know what, let's hang up football, have the surgery and we'll get you ready for baseball
[00:28:13] season.
[00:28:14] And you said what year was this?
[00:28:15] What was it?
[00:28:16] What school year was it?
[00:28:18] Like this was your junior year?
[00:28:19] This was my like summer.
[00:28:22] Yeah.
[00:28:23] Summer going into senior year.
[00:28:25] Got it.
[00:28:26] And so we decided to go ahead with the surgery and they went in and they did like an orthoscope
[00:28:32] and they found like the ligaments torn and then they just went ahead and sewed them back.
[00:28:36] And I remember it was a long recovery.
[00:28:39] It was like, it's almost six months.
[00:28:43] And this is, this is so my dad.
[00:28:44] So I get done, get the surgery, go through, you know, however long I was in a cast, get
[00:28:51] the cast off, literally came home from getting the cast off after being in it for like four
[00:28:56] months.
[00:28:57] It was, it was long.
[00:28:58] It was weird.
[00:28:59] And he, he literally put to grab two minutes and pulled me onto the beach and he was like,
[00:29:07] throw the ball.
[00:29:08] I'm not, I'm not making this shit up.
[00:29:10] First off, like, can you imagine the size, like difference?
[00:29:13] It was like, my wrist is like this big.
[00:29:15] I haven't done anything.
[00:29:17] I pick up the ball and this is no shit.
[00:29:19] I throw it.
[00:29:21] Was it a baseball or football?
[00:29:23] It was a baseball.
[00:29:24] Cause I was trying to, I was trying to get ready for baseball.
[00:29:25] I literally threw it like a foot in front of me.
[00:29:28] I didn't even know, and I didn't even know what to say.
[00:29:29] Like, dad, I can't, like I'm in a lot of pain.
[00:29:32] Did he get mad?
[00:29:33] He like, yeah.
[00:29:34] Oh my gosh.
[00:29:35] It was so fucking weird.
[00:29:39] Yeah, it got mad at me, like it was my fault that I couldn't throw this baseball after
[00:29:43] I just got out of it.
[00:29:45] Anyway, so, so I played baseball.
[00:29:47] Um, didn't have a great season.
[00:29:49] Just played in, in, in, um, my younger football coach, Tom Frawley, I considered kind of like
[00:30:00] my second dad and quarterback coach.
[00:30:01] And he just said, Hey man, you're so talented.
[00:30:04] He's like, I think you should play football in junior college.
[00:30:06] Like you're, you know, I, you know, I think you have something you should do that.
[00:30:10] And I said, yeah, you know, I kind of threw it around.
[00:30:12] I went, okay, I'll, you know, I'll take your advice.
[00:30:15] And I started throwing him in the summer and I wound up enrolling in, uh, at NASA community
[00:30:19] college in New York and NASA every year had like top 10 football.
[00:30:24] Um, they always sent, uh, literally anywhere between 15 and 20 guys to division one and,
[00:30:29] and big division ones like Ohio State and Miami and things like that.
[00:30:32] And so I was going to a real place to play.
[00:30:35] And when I showed up, man, I was, uh, I was skinny.
[00:30:40] I was 17 going into my freshman year of college.
[00:30:43] Damn, you were young.
[00:30:44] Yeah, it was, yeah, it was, it was, bro, your dad for all this push and should have held
[00:30:49] your ass back like two years, dude.
[00:30:51] Two.
[00:30:52] You're right.
[00:30:53] You're so right.
[00:30:55] So I, you know, I show up again, six, four, 180.
[00:31:00] And, um, I mean, these, this is like a division one junior college.
[00:31:03] These guys are massive from like Brooklyn and the Bronx and these guys are like straight
[00:31:08] up meat eaters.
[00:31:10] And, um, I'm like, man, I don't even know if I belong here.
[00:31:14] So I hung in as a, as a freshman, you get red shirted.
[00:31:17] Um, I went to practice every day.
[00:31:19] I worked hard and I turned 18 that December of my freshman year and like in February,
[00:31:26] I went from six, four, 180 to like six, four, 225.
[00:31:30] Yeah.
[00:31:31] I was on the program.
[00:31:32] I was getting jacked, getting jacked.
[00:31:35] And, uh, yeah, it was good.
[00:31:36] I was actually, you know, I felt like a, felt like a human after that.
[00:31:40] Well, and I didn't know you then, but from what I gather, all that pent up frustration
[00:31:47] from the bullies of your childhood, you started taking it out with your increased size.
[00:31:51] Yeah.
[00:31:52] We've talked about this.
[00:31:53] So yeah.
[00:31:54] So, so with the increased weight and size, um, yes, Amber is correct.
[00:31:57] Um, I did.
[00:31:58] I started getting into a lot of fights, Jaco.
[00:31:59] Really?
[00:32:00] I look stupid, like dumb.
[00:32:01] I was like, all the time, a lot.
[00:32:04] And it was like, and this is when you're at this community college.
[00:32:07] Yeah.
[00:32:08] It just fed me, I think because of the years of maybe, you know, dad and then like being
[00:32:12] skinny, constantly getting harassed.
[00:32:15] Um, I finally put on some weight and, uh, I would just snap every time we went out.
[00:32:20] It didn't matter where any bar, um, I was getting in a fight.
[00:32:24] Yeah.
[00:32:25] Guaranteed.
[00:32:26] I was like, I was that guy.
[00:32:27] You drinking now at this age?
[00:32:28] Yes.
[00:32:29] Yep.
[00:32:30] That doesn't subdue fighting.
[00:32:33] He doesn't help at all.
[00:32:34] He doesn't help.
[00:32:35] Um, yeah.
[00:32:36] I think growing up on Long Island, I actually remember the first time we drank because it
[00:32:40] was all my high school buddies freshman year, I believe it was Memorial Day.
[00:32:43] Like, Hey, Memorial Day, we're all going to get together.
[00:32:45] We're going to go get a couple cases.
[00:32:47] We're going to go down to the beach.
[00:32:48] We're going to drink some beer.
[00:32:50] And I remember saying, how can like, how can you put something in your body and it makes
[00:32:54] you act weird?
[00:32:55] Like I don't, I don't get it.
[00:32:56] Like I honestly did not get it.
[00:32:58] And we were having this argument.
[00:32:59] Like, I don't get it.
[00:33:00] Like I could drink 10 of these.
[00:33:01] Like I'm going to be fine.
[00:33:03] Um, and I think I remember at some point of that night, like humping the pole.
[00:33:08] Um, literally.
[00:33:09] And so, uh, yeah, don't, don't drink.
[00:33:14] So you're like 12 or 13 or something.
[00:33:18] Literally 13.
[00:33:19] I think it was 14 at that.
[00:33:20] Yeah.
[00:33:21] Because it was the second part of my freshman year.
[00:33:22] So did you keep drinking through this?
[00:33:26] Was it a thing or not really?
[00:33:27] Yeah.
[00:33:28] Yeah.
[00:33:29] I drank, um, I drank on the weekends when we went out.
[00:33:32] So never during the week, Amber still makes fun of me that I was in bed.
[00:33:36] He had a bedtime, 9pm until he left the house.
[00:33:42] Through senior year of high school, like not even during senior year.
[00:33:46] Was this a mandated by the old man?
[00:33:48] This is mandated by mom.
[00:33:49] Okay.
[00:33:50] Like, but at that point though, I didn't think for myself at all.
[00:33:53] I was just like, Oh, it's 830.
[00:33:55] I need to get ready and go to bed.
[00:33:57] You know, the light was on and my mom screaming down like, Mark is shut the light off, go
[00:34:01] to bed.
[00:34:02] You got to get up in the morning and catch the train.
[00:34:05] You know, um, meanwhile Amber's out at my house in college till like three in the morning.
[00:34:10] But we'll talk, we'll get into that after.
[00:34:12] Um, yeah.
[00:34:14] So, uh, where were we at?
[00:34:16] Are you, are you thinking through high school?
[00:34:18] Are you thinking about the military at all?
[00:34:20] No, not at all.
[00:34:21] I mean, I didn't, I didn't think much, Jacko.
[00:34:23] I'm just starting to come into thinking the last couple of years.
[00:34:25] And you're just solely focused on athletics.
[00:34:28] That's it.
[00:34:29] That's what you're going to do.
[00:34:30] Um, but, uh, yeah, I didn't think the only thing, the only connection I had to the military,
[00:34:35] my grandfather had a purple heart.
[00:34:37] It was in the house.
[00:34:39] I didn't know this between a purple heart and a purple rose.
[00:34:43] And, um, he mentioned it was from a mortar attack fighting the, uh, I think fighting
[00:34:49] in Northern Africa against the Italians.
[00:34:51] Um, and, but he was another guy who evidently gotten a lot of fights because I guess the
[00:34:58] military was a lot different from World War II or they would pull like your rank away.
[00:35:02] Like when you weren't on the battlefield, you know, if you got in trouble like he did.
[00:35:06] And then when he came back, I don't know, some weird story that I listened to, it was probably
[00:35:10] completely wrong coming from my dad.
[00:35:13] Um, so that's the only like real.
[00:35:15] Well, and your dad was in the army.
[00:35:17] Well, he was by, I think on, uh, I don't know if he got, where your dad, the hippie was,
[00:35:23] your dad, the hippie was in the army.
[00:35:25] Yeah.
[00:35:26] He was an MP.
[00:35:27] He's a dog handler.
[00:35:28] That's all I heard about growing up is his ferocious dog that bit everybody.
[00:35:32] So I'm like, so you're a shitty dog.
[00:35:35] Cause we had a few of those guys too, right?
[00:35:38] Like, did he give you any impression of like, Hey, you know, the military's dumb or you
[00:35:42] shouldn't join it or whatever, anything like that?
[00:35:44] Absolutely.
[00:35:45] Yeah.
[00:35:46] And I don't think he ever talked about it negatively.
[00:35:48] Just, just, just wasn't there.
[00:35:49] Yeah.
[00:35:50] It just wasn't there.
[00:35:51] Got it.
[00:35:52] And I wasn't with a crew of like, um, you know, first responder families, like police
[00:35:56] and fire.
[00:35:57] So I just didn't have that, you know, it was more like artists and, and, uh, but nothing
[00:36:02] negative, nothing ever negative, but really no, um, I was never, uh, it just wasn't a
[00:36:08] part of my life.
[00:36:09] I was raised a patriot.
[00:36:10] Yeah.
[00:36:11] Marcus was not.
[00:36:12] Yeah.
[00:36:13] So I was the one who, I was the one who got the better that I framed that I wrote in third
[00:36:16] grade on veterans day.
[00:36:18] And it was, it's so funny to read it back, but even as a nine year old, I'm like, yeah,
[00:36:23] that's who I am.
[00:36:24] Were your parents military or was your dad military or granddad or anything?
[00:36:27] No, my great grandmother had five brothers in World War II and two or three of them were
[00:36:33] killed.
[00:36:34] One of them was a POW.
[00:36:35] And so, you know, I just, it was just instilled in me that we love America and we honor our
[00:36:44] military.
[00:36:45] Um, but I didn't ever think I wanted to be married to someone in the military.
[00:36:50] That's a whole different ball game.
[00:36:51] Right.
[00:36:52] I was also, you know, my hometown was so small and, um, it wasn't, you know, a very, uh, there
[00:36:59] wasn't a lot of money in the area that I grew up.
[00:37:01] And so people that joined the military in my hometown couldn't afford college.
[00:37:05] It was just a way to pay for college.
[00:37:07] So like I had this great appreciation, but I also, I was completely dumb to like what
[00:37:11] the military service actually was.
[00:37:13] All right.
[00:37:14] So let's get into this.
[00:37:15] How the coach's daughter, I mean, how does this go about?
[00:37:19] This can't be, you were thinking much, right?
[00:37:24] Marcus, I mean, this is the good.
[00:37:26] This is like taboo.
[00:37:27] Is there anything more taboo than, oh, that's the coach's daughter.
[00:37:29] Cool.
[00:37:30] Yeah.
[00:37:31] That's where I'm going to go.
[00:37:32] Yeah.
[00:37:33] That's exactly it.
[00:37:34] I went to Southern Illinois, um, in, I don't know, was it 96 Amber?
[00:37:41] Yeah.
[00:37:42] And, uh, I'm just trying to think how I get into, how, how are you and I, so okay.
[00:37:49] When I was first looking at the, um, like the media guide for the football teams before
[00:37:54] I even went to Southern Illinois, I was still in New York.
[00:37:57] Um, I saw that coach Watson had had, you know, obviously had a family in there and had a
[00:38:01] daughter.
[00:38:02] Again, never even, I was like, Oh wow, that's interesting.
[00:38:06] You know, that, that's, came across my mind.
[00:38:09] Um, but that was it.
[00:38:10] Like let's put that away now for like two more years.
[00:38:14] And I show up at school and I think about a year and a half in is I met you at Cuckoo's.
[00:38:23] No, at a golf tournament, but I didn't even see you there.
[00:38:27] You didn't see me.
[00:38:28] I saw you at the golf tournament.
[00:38:29] Yeah.
[00:38:30] You looked really angry and pissed off that you were there.
[00:38:32] Yeah.
[00:38:33] Well, so we had, we did a, um, I guess, uh, a volunteer for the, some golf tournament
[00:38:38] and I remember seeing Amber there like at the table and she was angry and I remember a guy
[00:38:43] saying like that's coach Watson's daughter.
[00:38:45] You know, everyone was like, okay, stay away from, are you just trying to keep people at
[00:38:48] bay just scowling at everyone or what was up with that?
[00:38:51] I don't know.
[00:38:52] I think I was probably, I don't know.
[00:38:56] I think I was probably traumatized by having to be there.
[00:39:01] Um, so, so that's the first time.
[00:39:04] Are you, are Marcus at this point, are you like a full on like just straight beard, swill
[00:39:09] and jock?
[00:39:10] Yes.
[00:39:11] What are we dealing with?
[00:39:12] 100%.
[00:39:13] But a nice, but I was a nice job.
[00:39:14] I don't know if that makes any sense.
[00:39:16] But you're fighting a lot.
[00:39:17] I'm fighting a lot.
[00:39:18] Still fighting a lot when you get to college.
[00:39:20] Oh yeah.
[00:39:21] Oh gosh.
[00:39:22] Yeah.
[00:39:23] Um, I mean, we'll go into, I mean, I was suspended from Amber's dad my whole sophomore year after
[00:39:29] I just got named the starting quarterback over four seniors.
[00:39:35] So your dad was great in recruiting me, but not in the choice of personality.
[00:39:41] So that night I go out, go to fraternity party.
[00:39:45] This is the night you get named as a starting quarterback.
[00:39:47] So you're freaking stoked.
[00:39:50] And I'd been hearing about him and you know, like the whole area had been hearing about
[00:39:55] him because you get like this big good looking guy from New York and it's who's named Marcus
[00:40:00] Capone.
[00:40:02] And so I'm like hearing this buzz.
[00:40:05] But did you meet him yet when he gets named as a starting quarterback?
[00:40:07] No, no.
[00:40:08] And apparently we'd been at that golf tournament, but I didn't know who he was.
[00:40:12] And got it.
[00:40:13] So, all right.
[00:40:14] So now you get named.
[00:40:15] So we go out myself, the fullback who was my roommate who's just a stud, you know, like
[00:40:20] 600, 400 pound guy, like a squat bench, you know, that type of dude and can run like a
[00:40:24] four, five, 40.
[00:40:26] And we go to this fraternity party, which is really off limits.
[00:40:32] Football athletes and fraternities really didn't mix.
[00:40:35] Most of the fraternities.
[00:40:36] Like officially, like you're not allowed to go to them or just?
[00:40:38] No, it's more, you just don't because a lot of those guys were high school athletes that
[00:40:43] couldn't play in college.
[00:40:45] And so there was a little bit of like, you know, bad blood.
[00:40:48] We went because a lot of the female trainers that you go and get your, you know, put your
[00:40:53] eyes and, you know, your elbow and eyes or get hooked up to stem or whatever.
[00:40:58] They were all sorority.
[00:41:00] So they invited us.
[00:41:01] So three of us went.
[00:41:02] And right from this get go, you can tell, like just it's in the air.
[00:41:06] You know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:41:09] You could feel the energy in there was just not going our direction.
[00:41:14] And one thing led to another.
[00:41:15] And the next thing you know, there's literally a whole fraternity house on top of us in the
[00:41:20] middle of the yard.
[00:41:21] There were so many of them.
[00:41:23] I think it was lucky.
[00:41:24] I think it was what saved us because there were so many that they couldn't like get to
[00:41:27] us and like punch and kick and everything else.
[00:41:29] But I do remember like being on the ground and going, man, they can't even get to us.
[00:41:33] There's so many of them.
[00:41:35] I remember this hand.
[00:41:36] I could feel this hand like coming up like my arm and then my shoulder and then my neck.
[00:41:42] And then I feel like it's in my face and then like just start like, like, like raking me
[00:41:46] like raking my high.
[00:41:47] I'm like, this guy's trying to pull my and I couldn't do anything about it.
[00:41:51] So for somehow, this is the best.
[00:41:53] So somehow the fullback, my roommate crawls out underneath all of them and charges the
[00:41:59] wooden fence and both literally hits it and knocks the whole fence down the yard.
[00:42:05] So you can tell how well these fences were made in a college, you know, collegiate house,
[00:42:12] pieces of crap.
[00:42:13] So the fence goes down, which enables us to get out.
[00:42:16] Fix now we're out of the yard.
[00:42:17] So I'm standing in the street like my eye is completely red like they now they like it's
[00:42:23] it's it's good and scratched.
[00:42:26] I'm missing a sandal.
[00:42:28] My shirts rift.
[00:42:31] You know, I'm standing in the street cursing and we cool down a little bit and we go walking
[00:42:37] back to the the dorms, go to bed because that was a fun night getting getting jumped
[00:42:43] by a fraternity house, the pikes.
[00:42:46] I shouldn't even gave him that.
[00:42:48] Gave him that shout out.
[00:42:50] You guys are just jealous.
[00:42:55] And we we come across the street.
[00:42:59] We crossed the strip where all the bars and clubs are at and out on the street.
[00:43:07] This club is emptying and it's the all the guys in the football team are coming out and
[00:43:13] they're like Marcus what's going on with what what the fuck happened to you.
[00:43:18] I'm like, oh man, you know, the the the pikes they jumped us and these guys are everyone's
[00:43:23] drunk and that was it.
[00:43:26] So they decided they're going to go back to the fraternity house.
[00:43:30] So like 30 dudes go back to the fraternity house.
[00:43:34] I follow behind them.
[00:43:36] And when I get there, it's complete mayhem.
[00:43:40] There's people getting bricks busted over their face.
[00:43:42] I watched a person in the NFL pick up a grill and throw it on somebody.
[00:43:51] So it was it was that type of shit going on.
[00:43:53] And I was like, wow.
[00:43:56] So police you could hear police sirens coming and like everybody splits and you know, kind
[00:44:03] of the rest is history.
[00:44:04] I get brought in because I was the only white guy at the at the fight.
[00:44:09] They couldn't identify anybody there.
[00:44:12] And they wanted me to give up all the names of the guys over there.
[00:44:16] And I was like, no chance.
[00:44:18] I don't even know who's there actually.
[00:44:19] So because I would not give up any names, your dad Amber suspended me for the whole
[00:44:25] season.
[00:44:28] Because they couldn't identify anybody.
[00:44:30] And so I wind up being suspended for pretty much that was and that was it.
[00:44:34] Kind of crushed your dad's a hard ass.
[00:44:37] I think it was pressured.
[00:44:39] No, my dad is very principled.
[00:44:42] And on the same hand, my dad, you know, was trying to turn this program around and his
[00:44:48] entire team would have been out.
[00:44:51] So Marcus took the punishment for the whole team.
[00:44:55] And I know he felt bad about that.
[00:44:58] But I also know that he respected Marcus not giving up anyone's names.
[00:45:02] And it coincidentally saved his ass too, I'm sure.
[00:45:06] But I remember that fight because I had worked really hard all summer to save money for a
[00:45:12] car and we were going to go buy the car.
[00:45:15] And I had, I had picked the car out.
[00:45:18] We were supposed to go in Saturday.
[00:45:20] We being you and your dad?
[00:45:22] No really just me.
[00:45:23] Oh, OK.
[00:45:24] Just to go back, like it wasn't it was a local fight, but evidently some of the guys
[00:45:29] of the fraternity houses, dads were in kind of higher positions in Chicago.
[00:45:33] It made national news because eight guys got sent to the hospital.
[00:45:37] So yeah, it was like a it's not good.
[00:45:39] That's a legit scrap.
[00:45:40] And I had a few drinks, as you can imagine.
[00:45:43] It was legit scrap for sure.
[00:45:45] So I had picked out this car.
[00:45:47] I'd been working so hard for it.
[00:45:48] My dad had been so busy and we were going to go on Saturday morning at 10 a.m. something
[00:45:53] and I call my dad and I'm like, dad, are you ready?
[00:45:56] And he goes like, no honey, my quarterback caused the biggest fight last night.
[00:46:01] You have no idea the shit storm I'm dealing with.
[00:46:03] And so I'm like, screw your quarterback.
[00:46:05] I hate him.
[00:46:06] I don't even know him.
[00:46:07] He's all I wanted was I've waited so long to get this car.
[00:46:10] So anyway, that was also the beginning of my independence of being like, you know what?
[00:46:14] I'll go negotiate this deal.
[00:46:15] And that's exactly what I did.
[00:46:17] So that was sort of how I came to know like who Marcus even was because it was all over
[00:46:23] the news.
[00:46:24] And then I saw his picture in the paper and I was immediately like, oh, damn.
[00:46:30] This is the guy.
[00:46:31] He's so hot.
[00:46:33] And like fast forward, probably a year.
[00:46:38] My best friend had drank too much at a bowling alley slash nightclub and I had to go pick
[00:46:44] her up and I was not happy about that either.
[00:46:46] And so when I walked in, I went to the back door and the bouncer opened the door so I
[00:46:53] could get in together and Marcus was like, from me to him right now.
[00:46:58] He's right there and I was like immediately taken so aback.
[00:47:03] And I just said, oh, you're the troublemaker.
[00:47:06] And we sparked this conversation.
[00:47:09] I, oh, I was so smitten, but I didn't, I don't think I let on like I was.
[00:47:13] And I saw you there every week for like four weeks.
[00:47:16] I went back every week and then he wasn't there one week.
[00:47:21] And his friend who is the bouncer there took my number and gave it to Marcus and he called
[00:47:26] me that night and we hung out for the first time on July 4th of 1997 and we've been thick
[00:47:34] since.
[00:47:37] The end.
[00:47:39] So suspended.
[00:47:41] Was that your sophomore year?
[00:47:42] That's my sophomore year.
[00:47:43] You get suspended.
[00:47:44] Yeah.
[00:47:45] Are you allowed to practice?
[00:47:46] Like what are you doing?
[00:47:47] Yes.
[00:47:48] So I had, yeah, I just work in your ass off.
[00:47:49] Yeah, I work my ass off.
[00:47:50] I practiced every day.
[00:47:52] I went into treatment room, you know, three days, three times a day, still went to study
[00:47:57] hall, which we had to do every evening.
[00:47:59] And then I broke down every film.
[00:48:00] So I'd have to watch hours and hours of every play from every angle of every upcoming game.
[00:48:07] And then I would write, you know, take notes and like all defensive, um, coverages.
[00:48:12] And so like I learned, you know, I learned, um, but it was miserable because I couldn't
[00:48:17] play on.
[00:48:18] What did you think of my dad?
[00:48:19] I don't think I've ever asked you this.
[00:48:20] What was your relationship with my dad like?
[00:48:23] It was, it was good.
[00:48:24] No, we, I mean, we always had a good relationship.
[00:48:26] I mean, I was angry because I didn't get to, you know, I didn't get to play.
[00:48:29] Like,
[00:48:30] How did he treat you then?
[00:48:31] He treated me well.
[00:48:32] Yeah.
[00:48:33] I mean, I was cut up film from every day.
[00:48:35] It seems like like, like there's a little bit of mutual respect.
[00:48:38] Like he respect, kind of respect the fact that you didn't rat anybody out.
[00:48:41] He actually said, they said that too.
[00:48:42] They all said that because they were like, kind of saved the season because if you, if
[00:48:46] any of those, you know, they were all, they were all, you know, they're all the stars,
[00:48:50] right?
[00:48:51] So, um, and these were good guys.
[00:48:53] Um, so they weren't, yeah, they weren't angry.
[00:48:56] They were just like, you're an idiot.
[00:48:58] You got, one, you got caught too.
[00:49:01] What are you doing at the pike house?
[00:49:02] You know, that's right.
[00:49:04] So there was one time when we were dating, but we hadn't been dating for too long that
[00:49:09] Marcus came home from practice and said, your dad knows.
[00:49:13] And I was like, Oh, what do you mean?
[00:49:16] My dad knows.
[00:49:17] Yeah.
[00:49:18] That's after he left and went to Northwest.
[00:49:19] Yeah.
[00:49:20] So we were never dating when my dad was there.
[00:49:22] Got it.
[00:49:23] That year that Marcus was breaking down film and whatnot.
[00:49:27] At the end of that year, my dad took a job at Northwestern.
[00:49:30] And so a new coach had come in and I met you when, when coach Q had taken over the team.
[00:49:36] Yeah.
[00:49:37] And your dad already left.
[00:49:38] So, but he did find out and he called and he was not happy with her.
[00:49:42] Yeah.
[00:49:43] I was 17.
[00:49:44] Oh, she's the high school.
[00:49:45] She's in my senior year of high school.
[00:49:46] Oh, damn.
[00:49:47] And how old are you at this point?
[00:49:49] 20.
[00:49:50] Oh yeah.
[00:49:51] That's not a happy dad.
[00:49:52] I got three daughters, man.
[00:49:53] Yeah.
[00:49:54] You wouldn't be happy.
[00:49:55] I have a sophomore, San Diego State.
[00:49:57] I get it.
[00:49:58] Yeah.
[00:49:59] She has pepper spray and taser on that all the time.
[00:50:05] I had to call him because I didn't, you know, I respect my dad a lot and I wanted to call
[00:50:13] him and sort of like head this off.
[00:50:16] And one of Marcus's coaches who was still friends with him said like, hey, coach Watson
[00:50:21] knows that you're dating his daughter.
[00:50:24] So I called him and he was like, well, honey, I'm going to tell you this.
[00:50:32] He said, Marcus is one of the few players that I can say that I truly love.
[00:50:36] Like I love that kid.
[00:50:37] He's like, but he's a womanizer and he will break your heart.
[00:50:42] And if he breaks your heart, you tell him, I will break his neck.
[00:50:45] Oh, there you go.
[00:50:47] Right on.
[00:50:48] Pops coming in hot.
[00:50:50] He had a, yeah, he had a, he had a temper.
[00:50:52] Yeah.
[00:50:53] He had a real temper on the field.
[00:50:54] He had a temper.
[00:50:55] No, he actually had a temper everywhere.
[00:50:58] He's an amazing human being.
[00:51:01] So, so your dad leaves from coaching that job the next year.
[00:51:06] Now it's your junior year in college.
[00:51:07] Are you starting as a quarterback?
[00:51:08] No.
[00:51:09] I'm a really good quarterback from Missouri who actually split time at University of Missouri
[00:51:14] with one of the guys who was up for the Heisman.
[00:51:17] So you know, really after the fight, I feel like everything just went downhill after that.
[00:51:21] So we still on the team.
[00:51:23] I was still on the team.
[00:51:24] I was still under, you know, still in scholarship.
[00:51:26] So I, this, this guy came in and, you know, we're actually really close to, to this date.
[00:51:33] Kent Scornia, he's very successful in, in Missouri and St. Louis.
[00:51:37] And actually he's a donor to Vets and he was always my roommate on the road.
[00:51:42] But he, yeah, he came in, he was like a true quarterback from the Midwest.
[00:51:47] Like this guy could sling the ball all over the place.
[00:51:49] And I played quarterback more as a linebacker, you know, and that was our difference.
[00:51:54] So I would, you know, I would put my head down and, you know, he would, he would throw
[00:51:58] the ball, you know, and slide and things like that.
[00:52:01] And finally they moved me over to tight end my senior year just because I wasn't going
[00:52:07] to get on the field with him.
[00:52:09] But we, we actually split time, first couple of games of the season.
[00:52:14] And I did well, but he wound up like kind of taking command and control and, and, and
[00:52:19] he was like a true leader, true quarterback.
[00:52:20] I was a bit of a knucklehead and wanted to get in fights and run linebackers over, you
[00:52:25] know, and yeah.
[00:52:27] So, that's what, was there a point in your life when you thought you were going to play
[00:52:31] in the NFL?
[00:52:34] I mean, from when I was, you know, five, Jaco, that's what I wanted.
[00:52:38] That's what I wanted to do.
[00:52:39] I should have rephrased that.
[00:52:40] You know, there had to be a point in your life when you were going to play in the NFL.
[00:52:43] When did that dream go out?
[00:52:45] Like when did that flame extinguish?
[00:52:48] That flame extinguished my, it was my, before my senior year.
[00:52:56] So I popped for, I popped for testosterone.
[00:52:59] This is your senior year of college?
[00:53:01] Yeah.
[00:53:02] Yeah.
[00:53:03] Going into the senior year.
[00:53:04] So Marcus, you're moving over to tight end.
[00:53:05] You're going to start at tight end, put on some weight.
[00:53:06] Roger that.
[00:53:07] So I went and found some testosterone, sipping eight and got, got bulky and faster.
[00:53:13] And I remember we were doing off season workouts and the quarterback who, who we were about
[00:53:19] the same speed, I put on 20 pounds and then I started beating him in the, in, in sprints.
[00:53:24] He was like, dude, what the fuck?
[00:53:26] He's like, how can you gain weight and be faster than me all of a sudden?
[00:53:30] So the NCAA came in actually three weeks early and a few of us popped positive for,
[00:53:37] for performance enhancing drugs.
[00:53:41] So that's like, I had a, I had a new guy that was a bicycle rider and he said that when
[00:53:49] you're on, or maybe I just heard this on a, I don't know where I heard this.
[00:53:52] I think I'm just going to know.
[00:53:53] Who said like, he's a bike rider.
[00:53:55] And he said, when someone's on, on juice, it's like they're on a Harley.
[00:53:59] Like you literally just can't hang with them.
[00:54:01] They're just that much better.
[00:54:03] So did you feel like, I mean, it sounds like, dude, you put on 20 pounds and you got faster.
[00:54:08] Oh, I mean, I could, I could dunk a basketball just from a straight vertical leap.
[00:54:12] You know, yeah, it's, it's pretty, pretty, pretty potent stuff.
[00:54:17] When you're, when you're abusing it like that, not when you're like using it for like
[00:54:20] replacement therapy, you know, where they're trying to keep your levels at around.
[00:54:23] Seven or 800.
[00:54:24] We're talking about, you know, 2400, 2000, you know, your blood, your blood levels are
[00:54:29] through the roof.
[00:54:30] And, but you do, you feel like.
[00:54:32] Who's your guide during this?
[00:54:34] Guide?
[00:54:35] Yeah.
[00:54:36] Just bro science.
[00:54:37] This is straight up.
[00:54:38] Bro science, no Google.
[00:54:41] This is what three of my buddies said.
[00:54:43] Oh yeah, that guy was in the Marine Corps.
[00:54:45] This guy, you know, took steroids in high school.
[00:54:49] And yeah, we think it's okay.
[00:54:50] You'll be fine.
[00:54:51] So you pop positive.
[00:54:54] I didn't know the NCA was tested back then.
[00:54:56] Yeah.
[00:54:57] I guess I'm just the idiot.
[00:54:58] Yeah, they tested everybody.
[00:55:00] Well, I shouldn't say they tested everybody was random, but.
[00:55:04] And so then are you done?
[00:55:05] Or is that the end of your.
[00:55:06] That's it.
[00:55:07] And I'm done.
[00:55:08] So you said that's the moment when you realized the NFL wasn't happening.
[00:55:12] NFL wasn't happening.
[00:55:15] And you finish.
[00:55:16] How'd your dad feel about that before we go?
[00:55:18] What do you think?
[00:55:19] No, it wasn't your dad.
[00:55:21] No, your dad already left.
[00:55:23] The head coach called.
[00:55:25] They weren't happy.
[00:55:26] But everything, they were always like, ah, it's not Marcus' fault.
[00:55:30] It must have been something else.
[00:55:32] Yeah, my parents.
[00:55:33] Oh, your parents were like, they shifted blame.
[00:55:36] They covered for you a little bit.
[00:55:38] But your dad must have been realizing that the dream was over.
[00:55:41] Probably his dream.
[00:55:42] The NFL dream.
[00:55:43] Yeah, his dream.
[00:55:44] His NFL dream.
[00:55:45] Which by the way, I had like a one in like a trillion chance of making it to the NFL.
[00:55:49] For sure.
[00:55:50] For sure.
[00:55:51] But you got to, I mean, it seems like anybody in pursuing any athletic pursuit that hard
[00:55:57] is going to think, well, I'm going to be able to make it.
[00:55:59] And then at some point you go, it ain't happening.
[00:56:03] You want to go as hard and far as you can.
[00:56:05] Right?
[00:56:06] I mean, that's, that's all you know.
[00:56:07] Literally, it's all you know.
[00:56:08] I mean, I remember getting in the teams and telling guys and buds like, dude, I never
[00:56:11] turned a wrench.
[00:56:12] Like all I did, all my dad had me do is play ball.
[00:56:15] Like I literally, you know, so I learned a lot.
[00:56:18] And I just, you know, that's why I thought just the teams are so good.
[00:56:21] Cause I just learned a lot of like man shit outside of, you know, playing ball, which
[00:56:24] I look at now.
[00:56:25] I don't even, I don't remember the last time I watched the sporting event, right?
[00:56:28] Yeah.
[00:56:29] You know, I kind of frown upon some of the stuff that's going on.
[00:56:31] It's gross, but yeah.
[00:56:34] So is this when you started thinking about going in the teams?
[00:56:38] Into the teams.
[00:56:42] What was the trigger there?
[00:56:43] You're going to love this.
[00:56:45] This is right up your alley, Jaco.
[00:56:47] So my roommate, of course, dad was a seal in Vietnam.
[00:56:53] I don't think he was.
[00:56:56] He may have been a Marine.
[00:56:57] Wait, what roommate?
[00:56:59] Jason.
[00:57:00] Jason O'Neill.
[00:57:01] Oh.
[00:57:02] Yeah.
[00:57:03] When he lived in the apartment, remember?
[00:57:05] Yeah.
[00:57:06] I didn't know he was part of the story.
[00:57:07] I think he's part of the story.
[00:57:08] I'm just thinking, you know, you said I'm going to love this story.
[00:57:10] So I figured like one of your brother, your one of your friends dad was.
[00:57:14] You're going to love it, but then you're going to scratch your head too and be like,
[00:57:17] all right, we're going to go with this, Marcus.
[00:57:19] So we're sitting in the apartment one night.
[00:57:23] And this guy actually started as a freshman, wind up when we graduated.
[00:57:27] I went in the Navy, he went in the Marine Corps, flew F-18s, you know, did the whole
[00:57:32] thing, top gun and all that good stuff.
[00:57:35] And then of course the Marine Corps, what they do to their guys who go to flight school,
[00:57:40] YF-18s and go to top gun, you would expect them to continue flying.
[00:57:44] They handed him an M16 and put him on the ground in Afghanistan, you know, with all
[00:57:52] that training, I guess as a fact.
[00:57:53] Yeah, that's what the Marine Corps does.
[00:57:55] Yeah.
[00:57:56] That's one of the best things that they do is because those guys can talk to aircraft
[00:57:59] better than anybody else.
[00:58:00] And 100% and he did, but he did complain because he said, man, you know, they spent all this
[00:58:05] money on training me how to fly.
[00:58:06] And he's like, I was really good at it.
[00:58:08] And then I'm on the fucking ground in Afghanistan dodging mortars, you know, which he never,
[00:58:13] ever signed up to do.
[00:58:16] So it was just interesting to hear from his perspective, like they don't like it, you
[00:58:19] know, they want to fly and now they're stuck calling in cast.
[00:58:23] One of my really good friends was the same thing, Marine Corps, F-18, top gun instructor,
[00:58:30] top gun senior instructor.
[00:58:31] And he was a fac on the ground.
[00:58:33] He was Anglico team leader in Ramadi with us just getting after it.
[00:58:38] And it's funny because he taught like all the stuff he did in the Marine Corps, he taught
[00:58:43] like he talks about what he did for this one six month deployment to Ramadi because a lot
[00:58:49] different than what it was as I constantly tell him being in an air conditioned cockpit,
[00:58:54] you know, 20,000 feet up in the air.
[00:58:56] That's right.
[00:58:57] Yeah.
[00:58:58] You're right.
[00:58:59] I mean, those guys, can you imagine what kind of perspective they get on the ground and
[00:59:02] then go back up there and go, wait a minute, like I know what it was like down there.
[00:59:05] That's the Marine Corps.
[00:59:07] And I've read some great stories about like the Korean war, those Marine Corps pilots
[00:59:11] that would go and deploy, they're like the Marines, everyone loved them because they
[00:59:15] can just talk to those pilots the way they need to be talked to.
[00:59:17] So I mean, and look, we have the JTACs.
[00:59:20] There's JTACs are awesome too.
[00:59:23] But in the Marine Corps, just with the way they do it and it's pretty freaking cool.
[00:59:27] So this guy is your roommate.
[00:59:29] So my roommate.
[00:59:30] We come home, we throw on the TV and on comes this movie and looking at it and you know,
[00:59:39] it's got people run around and I think you're talking about Sean.
[00:59:43] No, I'm not.
[00:59:44] Okay.
[00:59:45] No, you are incorrect.
[00:59:47] One.
[00:59:48] Amherst incorrect two times out of a hundred.
[00:59:51] I always 98% right.
[00:59:53] I just don't ever remember you living with him.
[00:59:55] Yeah.
[00:59:56] We lived together remember for like six months.
[00:59:57] I don't remember that.
[00:59:58] Okay.
[00:59:59] Sorry.
[01:00:00] I love you.
[01:00:01] It's all good.
[01:00:02] I love you.
[01:00:03] And and they so here G.I. Jane.
[01:00:07] So G.I. Jane comes on.
[01:00:08] I'm just going to get to the point.
[01:00:11] All right.
[01:00:12] G.I. Jane comes on TV and I'm like, what is this?
[01:00:16] And they start talking about, you know, these units and this and that.
[01:00:20] And I have when you were talking about exposure to the military, I hadn't I had none.
[01:00:24] So if I had exposure, I could have maybe called this out right away.
[01:00:28] This was it.
[01:00:29] This was my military.
[01:00:30] I'm like, I want to do that.
[01:00:32] Like this looks hard.
[01:00:34] They said these are the best of the best, right?
[01:00:36] Because they talk about it in there.
[01:00:38] Not not Demi Moore, but the rest of it.
[01:00:41] So that's what actually just told me that there's a unit out there that's special and
[01:00:48] supposed to be the toughest training in the world.
[01:00:51] And that's that's what piqued my at least my initial interest to start to look into it
[01:00:56] and go, let me just look into what this is.
[01:00:58] And so, you know, then I read the first book because back then it was there was nothing
[01:01:03] online about the teams.
[01:01:06] So I just I read I literally read every book from Vietnam.
[01:01:10] I mean, everything all and the more I read, the more I got like focused and the more hungry
[01:01:18] and and and, you know, and then nothing else mattered.
[01:01:21] Do you start training at this point?
[01:01:23] I did.
[01:01:24] I did.
[01:01:26] You also met someone who is at SIU and he was a seal, right?
[01:01:32] Yeah.
[01:01:33] Oh, God, I forgot his name from.
[01:01:35] Yeah, from.
[01:01:36] He died in a car accident.
[01:01:37] Yeah, team four.
[01:01:38] I remember.
[01:01:39] I know you're talking about.
[01:01:40] Yeah, I thought he was like.
[01:01:41] Will Buschell.
[01:01:42] Will Buschell.
[01:01:43] There you go.
[01:01:44] Will Buschell.
[01:01:45] And so imagine you're in college, you know how it is.
[01:01:46] You want to be a team guy or in high school and then you go, you find out that there's
[01:01:51] a guy that was a team guy.
[01:01:53] So he, of course, he, you know, he slipped people's throats behind enemy lines.
[01:01:57] And like, so every time I saw this guy, I was like, I was in awe, you know, and of course,
[01:02:02] then when I got the team, they're like, oh, that shit.
[01:02:04] No, I'm joking.
[01:02:05] I'm totally kidding.
[01:02:06] He actually had a decent reputation.
[01:02:08] But yeah, I looked up to this kid and I was just, you know, I was just hungry after that.
[01:02:14] Jaco, it was nothing mattered.
[01:02:17] I called my parents.
[01:02:18] I told them what I wanted to do and they thought I was crazy.
[01:02:22] Remember that I was crazy.
[01:02:24] But as you know, once you get on that path, nothing else matters.
[01:02:29] And it's nothing but focus and discipline and like, that's it.
[01:02:33] What did you do?
[01:02:34] Were you dropping weight?
[01:02:36] Were you because I stopped lifting?
[01:02:38] Got it.
[01:02:39] That's what I did.
[01:02:40] So all I knew was like sport lifting, you know, heavy weights.
[01:02:44] I completely stopped lifting and all I did was body weight workouts.
[01:02:48] So the typical like Stu Smith, I think I had maybe the book, you know, push ups, pull
[01:02:51] ups, sit ups, dips.
[01:02:54] Nobody taught me how to do any of these, by the way.
[01:02:55] Nobody taught me how to even like jog to like, I didn't know anything.
[01:02:59] Like I never jogged, like just went out and ran like six miles.
[01:03:02] Everything was like 40 yard sprints, you know, or maybe hundreds.
[01:03:06] But that was it.
[01:03:07] And so I thought I was like jogging at a good pace until I ran with Sean Toll, who was in
[01:03:12] the army for a long time.
[01:03:14] I went for a run with him and were you jogging slower or I was jogging slower.
[01:03:19] I was like, oh, this is good.
[01:03:21] I'm like, I'm working out.
[01:03:22] This is jogging.
[01:03:23] This is this is jogging.
[01:03:24] And he crushed me.
[01:03:26] Like I couldn't even, I could barely keep up with him.
[01:03:28] And he's like, I'm not even running at a hard pace.
[01:03:30] I went, holy shit, this is like, so he kind of brought me up to another level that I just
[01:03:34] didn't know about.
[01:03:35] So then I started, you know, jogging faster.
[01:03:38] And so this is what you're doing your senior year.
[01:03:41] This is my senior year.
[01:03:42] This is my senior year of college.
[01:03:43] Senior, senior year of college.
[01:03:45] And it was like this summer before your senior year that you decided to do this.
[01:03:49] He came to me and said he wanted to be a seal.
[01:03:52] And of course there was no 9-11.
[01:03:54] I didn't know what a seal was.
[01:03:55] I really didn't know the difference between the army and the Navy.
[01:03:58] Although I was, I know I was patriotic, but then I also thought that maybe the military
[01:04:02] wasn't for me based on what I knew about kids from my hometown that went in it.
[01:04:06] And so I thought, you know, it's just a great jumping off point because Marcus was so captivating
[01:04:12] and so cute and such kind of a check in the box for me to be like, I dated the SIU quarterback.
[01:04:18] I don't expect that we'll stay together.
[01:04:20] You know, I thought maybe we'd date for the summer or whatever.
[01:04:24] And we'd been together at that point for two and a half years.
[01:04:27] And I met him at 17.
[01:04:28] So you know, in my mind, like no other guy had ever existed because he was everything
[01:04:33] to me.
[01:04:34] But at the same time, I knew that I was young and I was, you know, very independent.
[01:04:39] And I was raised an only child.
[01:04:41] I have two half brothers who I love like, like brothers.
[01:04:45] And I consider them brothers, but I was raised an only child.
[01:04:48] And so I wanted to be independent.
[01:04:49] I wanted to be, I wanted to graduate and, and move to maybe Chicago or St. Louis.
[01:04:56] I at some point even thought like, maybe I'll move to LA or New York.
[01:04:59] I just wanted to be.
[01:05:01] And when he told me he wanted to go into the military, I thought this is, this is perfect
[01:05:05] because they've kind of been thinking this and we're young and probably not going to
[01:05:09] stay together and get married.
[01:05:10] So by jumping off point, you mean jump off the freaking Marcus train and go your own
[01:05:15] way.
[01:05:16] Yeah.
[01:05:17] But in a healthy way.
[01:05:18] And I talked about it and he's like, you know, these are my goals and this is my vision.
[01:05:21] And I'm like, well, I'm, you know, I'm a couple of years behind June school and I wanted to
[01:05:25] rush a sorority.
[01:05:26] I wanted to be young and be not being this committed relationship.
[01:05:32] And so we, we had super amicably decided to break up.
[01:05:35] So you break up and this is how, when did you talk to a recruiter?
[01:05:40] So that's, that's what I was going to talk about next.
[01:05:42] So I did, I just went on the strip, same place where I ran into the guys coming out of the
[01:05:46] club.
[01:05:47] And there was recruiting, there was a Marine Corps Navy recruiting station there.
[01:05:51] And I went to talk to the Navy recruiter and he was a, he was a diver, combat diver.
[01:05:57] And he was really cool, like really cool.
[01:05:59] And he just said, Hey, he's like, you're, you're at the, you're at school here, right?
[01:06:02] And I said, yeah.
[01:06:03] He said, well, you know, you, you can be an officer.
[01:06:06] And I was like, what's that?
[01:06:07] I literally said, what's that?
[01:06:09] Fucking knucklehead, right?
[01:06:11] Um, he's like, well, you know, you go to college, you get your degree and you know, you could
[01:06:16] become an officer in the military.
[01:06:18] Most people that are enlisted, you know, don't go to college and they enlist and kind of
[01:06:22] explain this.
[01:06:23] Oh, okay.
[01:06:24] Well, that, that sounds cool.
[01:06:25] Like let's do that.
[01:06:26] And so he handed me off to St. Louis, which was running, I guess, um, they, I think they
[01:06:33] managed the individual officer recruitment.
[01:06:37] And again, I didn't like have, I had no mentors, you know, um, you know, as you know, a lot
[01:06:42] of the, you know, the officers that go on either go to the academy or they have, you
[01:06:46] know, congressmen, like they just, they have a better network.
[01:06:48] I just didn't know anybody.
[01:06:50] And so I was training on my own.
[01:06:53] And then the day I had to, uh, he drove the, the, the officer recruiter drove down from
[01:06:59] St. Louis and met me at the university to take my like PRT, CLPRT test.
[01:07:05] I borrowed a pair of, I've been training in sneakers.
[01:07:10] I borrowed a pair of boots because I didn't have any.
[01:07:11] She had to wear boots.
[01:07:13] Um, I'm a size 14.
[01:07:15] I, the only size that was available to me, I think it was like 11 and a half or 12.
[01:07:20] So I, I literally squeezed my feet into these size 12s about the second lap in, I completely
[01:07:29] like both my legs cramped up, uh, finished the run.
[01:07:35] Um, do start doing pushups and I'm doing, uh, what do they call them, uh, grasshopper pushups.
[01:07:41] Oh, like, like little half pushups.
[01:07:43] Yeah.
[01:07:44] Like your elbows are in instead of like out here.
[01:07:45] And he's like, stop.
[01:07:46] I went, what?
[01:07:47] He goes, you're, those aren't, those aren't pushups.
[01:07:49] Those are, we call those grasshopper pushups.
[01:07:51] I was like, well, it's the only ones that I know, you know, so I'm going to keep going.
[01:07:54] Cause I know you, you can't because they don't count.
[01:07:56] You have to move your arms here.
[01:07:58] So the whole test was a complete failure.
[01:07:59] Like I fucked that thing up completely.
[01:08:02] And um, you know, I found out, of course, I didn't get picked up for, for spec war, but
[01:08:07] I got picked up for every other officer program.
[01:08:09] So you come in, go to Nuke, you go to whatever.
[01:08:12] So, um, you can't, can't go to buds and you can transfer after two years.
[01:08:19] And I went, yeah, but you know, the reason, you know, just the only time I actually thought
[01:08:25] a little bit and the only reason I'm going in the military is, is to be a team guy.
[01:08:29] And, and so I just told him like, no, I, you know, I want to go to buds and he said, well,
[01:08:35] you can just go back to the, you know, the recruiter and you can enlist.
[01:08:39] I said, great.
[01:08:40] Can you give me a ride?
[01:08:41] Yeah, give me a ride.
[01:08:42] We shook hands.
[01:08:43] I took my, you know, my little packet that I already started building my record and went
[01:08:48] back to the recruiter.
[01:08:50] And I think I enlisted right there like son, you know, neps.
[01:08:53] I think it was, uh, yeah, or early, I think it was no, or, uh, depths, depths, depths,
[01:08:59] delayed entry.
[01:09:00] Yes.
[01:09:01] That was it.
[01:09:02] And then meps is where it actually happens.
[01:09:03] Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:04] Yeah, you're right.
[01:09:05] So you, in the, how long was it like when you enlisted, how many, how long does it have
[01:09:08] to wait before you could leave?
[01:09:10] It was quick.
[01:09:12] And we'll get, yeah, we can get in that story.
[01:09:13] But from when I talked to the recruiter, I think it was about six months.
[01:09:17] So I was, you know, I'd show up every month and they'd have like little gatherings or
[01:09:20] whatever, but I was still training, um, starting to get a little bit indoctrinated into the,
[01:09:26] into the military.
[01:09:27] So were you guys, were you guys split up when you actually signed the papers?
[01:09:31] No.
[01:09:32] Uh, we were actually living together.
[01:09:34] Oh, dang.
[01:09:35] And I don't remember that.
[01:09:36] No, I'm just kidding.
[01:09:37] And yeah, you were just training and getting ready.
[01:09:41] And we knew that, you know, the end was coming, but we were still together.
[01:09:46] Okay.
[01:09:47] And then you signed the papers and now you got your date.
[01:09:49] Hey, you're going to leave on this date.
[01:09:51] I'm going to leave.
[01:09:52] I'm going to leave on this date, uh, which was June 15th, 2000.
[01:10:01] And I don't know, when did you tell me?
[01:10:04] You were also finishing, he had his last semester in school, which ended in December
[01:10:09] and then you did your internship.
[01:10:10] Well, then I did my internship.
[01:10:11] I did my internship for four weeks, no, four months at the Breaker's Resort in Palm Beach,
[01:10:15] Florida.
[01:10:16] What is it?
[01:10:17] It was an terrible internship.
[01:10:18] It was like resort management.
[01:10:19] Like I basically got paid to be a, uh, a cabana boy and like get tips.
[01:10:24] I mean, literally.
[01:10:25] And then two weeks run the children's like kid program.
[01:10:28] It was crazy.
[01:10:29] And that's what you did from December until, until April.
[01:10:34] April.
[01:10:35] Yeah.
[01:10:36] So April came back, graduated, didn't walk.
[01:10:38] I didn't really care about like walking across the stage to me that wasn't.
[01:10:40] We're missing a huge chunk of that.
[01:10:43] Don't go too far into the story.
[01:10:45] Oh, where do you want me to stop?
[01:10:46] Because, well, in May, 2000.
[01:10:48] Okay, good.
[01:10:51] So in the summertime, July, August, school starting is when we decided, this will be
[01:10:58] our last semester together.
[01:10:59] I knew he was going to leave at the end of the semester.
[01:11:01] I also had an aunt who was dying of breast cancer and so, and I was working full time.
[01:11:05] I had 18 credit hours.
[01:11:07] I was working 30 hours a week.
[01:11:08] My aunt was dying.
[01:11:09] And so, um, for a couple of months I was thinking like, I'm not sure I feel quite right, but
[01:11:17] I just kept delaying what I would soon realize was the inevitable, which was taking a pregnancy
[01:11:23] test.
[01:11:24] Oh.
[01:11:25] And I finally took this test in October, um, and I had been pregnant since August.
[01:11:34] So I was about 12 weeks pregnant with our son when I found out and he was set to leave
[01:11:41] in two months in December.
[01:11:44] Set to leave for the Navy.
[01:11:45] For his internship.
[01:11:46] For all for the internship.
[01:11:47] Followed by the Navy.
[01:11:48] Okay.
[01:11:49] Okay, so got it.
[01:11:50] Now I'm tracking.
[01:11:51] Hey, I'm still trying to track the story.
[01:11:53] So it's a long time ago.
[01:11:55] So, so, was there a whirlwind and what did you do?
[01:11:58] I mean, so freaked out completely freaked out and Marcus was so supportive.
[01:12:04] Initially he's like, he's like, this is going to be fine.
[01:12:08] Like we're going to be parents.
[01:12:09] It's going to be fine.
[01:12:10] And here he is like all this, these dreams and plans and I was the one freaking out.
[01:12:15] And then he told his parents and they freaked out.
[01:12:18] And when they freaked out, he freaked out.
[01:12:20] When he freaked out, I really freaked out.
[01:12:21] There's a lot of freaking out.
[01:12:23] There's a lot of freaking out.
[01:12:25] Freaking out, shit, it rolls downhill.
[01:12:27] Obviously.
[01:12:28] Well, I just thought like my life is over.
[01:12:29] It's absolutely, I was so excited about this new beginning and it's over.
[01:12:35] And I now see that is the beginning.
[01:12:39] That's the beginning of everything.
[01:12:42] Thank God.
[01:12:43] Wow.
[01:12:45] So you find out in October, then in December you're going to be a cabana boy in Florida.
[01:12:50] That's right.
[01:12:51] Cabana boy.
[01:12:52] And you're expecting dad.
[01:12:53] Right.
[01:12:54] At the same time.
[01:12:55] Right.
[01:12:56] At 20, 22 years old.
[01:12:59] And you're already know you're going to join the Navy.
[01:13:02] Yes.
[01:13:03] 23.
[01:13:04] 23.
[01:13:05] And then what's the call then?
[01:13:07] So the call is I go do my internship because.
[01:13:11] You got to do to graduate or whatever.
[01:13:13] You got to do to graduate.
[01:13:14] Amber stays back.
[01:13:15] Did you, did you, did you go to school in the spring?
[01:13:18] Oh yeah.
[01:13:19] You did.
[01:13:20] Okay.
[01:13:21] So Amber's pregnant.
[01:13:22] She's pregnant in Palm Beach, Florida.
[01:13:27] Working as a cabana boy and snorkeling in the evenings on the, on the, on the.
[01:13:32] And training.
[01:13:33] You ran to.
[01:13:34] I mean, I trained my ass off down there.
[01:13:35] No, I did.
[01:13:36] But you're working 17 jobs or whatever with 18 credit hours.
[01:13:38] You're just like.
[01:13:39] I think I took 15 then in the spring.
[01:13:41] But yeah, I was working full time and going to school.
[01:13:45] I was nine months pregnant and taking finals.
[01:13:47] It was.
[01:13:48] Amber worked forever.
[01:13:49] Like from the day I met her, she was always working.
[01:13:52] Like nonstop and it hasn't stopped.
[01:13:55] So the reason we're still here.
[01:13:57] Um, yeah, she worked her ass off.
[01:13:59] She really did.
[01:14:00] She's a grinder.
[01:14:01] And then how did this whole scenario impact your decision to go in the Navy?
[01:14:06] It, I mean, it really didn't.
[01:14:09] Like I was, this is what I want to do.
[01:14:11] I, you know, at 23, I, I, I didn't, I didn't even think about what it was like to start
[01:14:19] a family.
[01:14:21] But then again, what were we supposed to do?
[01:14:22] I was supposed to graduate and then get a job, you know, like, well, here's your job.
[01:14:27] Yeah.
[01:14:28] I mean, here's, here's your job.
[01:14:29] How are you making, you know, how are you making money?
[01:14:31] Again, you know, my dad handed me a ball when I was three.
[01:14:34] Um, I don't know.
[01:14:36] I was scared to death.
[01:14:37] Honestly, I remember saying, I'm supposed to put on a shirt and tie now and go step
[01:14:41] off in the private sector and get a job, you know, doing what and making what to support,
[01:14:46] support the family.
[01:14:47] Like I was scared to death too.
[01:14:48] Then once I started really thinking about it.
[01:14:50] But the Navy seemed like the viable option to have a family.
[01:14:54] The Navy seemed at that time comfortable, you know,
[01:14:59] Yeah.
[01:15:00] It's like paycheck healthcare, paycheck healthcare.
[01:15:01] Yeah.
[01:15:02] And I think that's some of the, probably advice I got from individuals.
[01:15:04] I don't remember.
[01:15:05] I mean, I think maybe I talked to a few, just say, Hey, you'll, you know, she'll be taken
[01:15:08] care of, you'll be taken care of, you make a few hundred dollars more if you're married.
[01:15:14] Whoa.
[01:15:15] Um, and at that time when you don't have any, uh, money.
[01:15:19] And I don't think anybody, I mean, my parents are definitely not supporting us.
[01:15:22] And I mean, Amber's family of course would have, but we, I don't think we were thinking
[01:15:27] about that.
[01:15:28] No.
[01:15:29] So you end up getting married prior to leaving?
[01:15:31] Yeah.
[01:15:32] Well, we spent most of my pregnancy apart and not just because he was in Florida.
[01:15:38] It's because, you know, we had this whole like existential crisis where we didn't know
[01:15:44] how to make this new curve ball fit and there was, there were several months when I thought,
[01:15:51] I'm just going to raise this baby.
[01:15:53] You know, I, I absolutely thought about ending the pregnancy and I couldn't, there was no
[01:15:59] way I could.
[01:16:00] And I thought, I don't care what this means.
[01:16:03] I don't care how hard this is.
[01:16:04] I'm just going to figure it out.
[01:16:07] And, um, you know, even if that meant doing it by myself and Marcus was in the, um, kids
[01:16:15] area, like he had alluded to earlier, and we had picked our son's name before he left.
[01:16:26] And at the time no one was naming their kid, Caden.
[01:16:28] You know, it was like he wanted to name him Caden's.
[01:16:32] I think we saw in a baby name book and he's like, Oh, it's like the quarterback calling
[01:16:36] Caden's.
[01:16:37] He's like, but it sounds like a girl's name.
[01:16:39] So let's shorten it.
[01:16:41] And there was this little baby that came in when he was at the breakers named Caden.
[01:16:46] And we'd never heard that name before.
[01:16:48] And so he called me that night and he was like, I can't do this anymore.
[01:16:52] Let's figure this out.
[01:16:54] And so that's what we did.
[01:16:56] And we named him Caden.
[01:16:58] We named him Caden of battle, of war.
[01:17:01] That's the, that was the ready for battle.
[01:17:03] Ready for battle.
[01:17:04] That's the, that was the meaning.
[01:17:05] That was a cool name.
[01:17:07] Jack.
[01:17:08] Why not?
[01:17:09] I mean, I tried to call him like Nico.
[01:17:10] Oh, Nico Vito and major were his three names of choice, but I wasn't going for that.
[01:17:15] So yeah, we, we, Caden was born in May of 2000.
[01:17:19] Marcus came back, proposed.
[01:17:23] We got married in June of 2000.
[01:17:26] And then six days later he, he left for boot camp.
[01:17:32] Typical story.
[01:17:33] Just like most Americans, right?
[01:17:35] And did you stay like at home in Illinois?
[01:17:39] I did.
[01:17:40] When he left for boot camp and everything?
[01:17:41] Cause there's no point in doing anything else.
[01:17:42] Yeah.
[01:17:43] I couldn't, you know, move the Navy wasn't going to move me, but of course, and then
[01:17:46] he had to go to a school and C school.
[01:17:48] It's be a sonar tech.
[01:17:50] And so when he was finished with C school and he was getting ready for Bud's in dock,
[01:17:55] I was able to move out.
[01:17:56] Caden was nine months old at the time.
[01:17:58] So I was 21.
[01:17:59] I'd never been away from my little, you know, tiny town in Southern Illinois and we moved
[01:18:04] to the towers in Coronado.
[01:18:06] And so he would walk to work, like, you know, walk to Bud's every morning.
[01:18:12] We had no money.
[01:18:13] No, we were raking in the money at 1,082 per paycheck.
[01:18:17] And our rent was 1,000.
[01:18:18] I was going to say, what was the rent?
[01:18:19] A thousand.
[01:18:20] So we got a little bit of help from mom and dad.
[01:18:22] A little bit.
[01:18:23] Not really.
[01:18:24] Not really.
[01:18:25] Not really.
[01:18:26] You're right.
[01:18:27] We just racked up a lot of credit card bills.
[01:18:31] And now you're rolling into Bud's.
[01:18:33] Rolling into Bud's.
[01:18:34] How are you?
[01:18:35] How's your preparation?
[01:18:36] Are you good?
[01:18:37] I'm good.
[01:18:38] Yeah, really good.
[01:18:39] And you joined in May, June, July.
[01:18:42] So when September 11th, when is that?
[01:18:45] What's your career?
[01:18:46] Where are you at?
[01:18:47] Yeah.
[01:18:48] We should.
[01:18:49] We should.
[01:18:50] We should.
[01:18:51] We should.
[01:18:52] Were you in A school?
[01:18:53] No.
[01:18:54] We'll get into it.
[01:18:55] No, I was in third phase.
[01:18:56] Oh, damn.
[01:18:57] What's your first phase?
[01:18:58] First phase was good.
[01:19:00] So I showed up 175.
[01:19:04] Started.
[01:19:05] Wait, 175 pounds?
[01:19:06] No, no, no.
[01:19:07] I'm sorry.
[01:19:08] The number of students.
[01:19:10] People in the class.
[01:19:11] Got it.
[01:19:12] So I show up and I look around and there's a lot.
[01:19:17] I mean, that's a lot of people.
[01:19:18] 175 is a lot.
[01:19:19] Yeah.
[01:19:20] And all I keep hearing is one in four are going to make it, like 25%.
[01:19:25] And honestly, the first thing I thought of was, how can I be one of these one in four?
[01:19:29] There's so many people here.
[01:19:31] And again, I don't even consider myself, I'm not a big guy compared to the guys I played
[01:19:36] ball with in college.
[01:19:38] But everybody else there was like, oh, Marcus is a big guy.
[01:19:40] Oh, yeah, for sure.
[01:19:41] How tall are you?
[01:19:42] 6'4".
[01:19:43] And how much did you weigh when you started BUDS?
[01:19:44] Like two and a quarter, two and a quarter, 225.
[01:19:46] That's a big dude going through BUDS.
[01:19:48] Yeah.
[01:19:49] And I was just FYI.
[01:19:50] I was like, just turned 19 and I was 174 pounds when I got there.
[01:19:55] I was like a little kid.
[01:19:56] It was so awesome.
[01:19:57] We had guys, like you probably like, you had guys in BUDS that gained weight during BUDS.
[01:20:01] I did.
[01:20:02] I gained 10 pounds.
[01:20:03] I gained 10 pounds.
[01:20:04] But like, if you, you, you were what, 23, 24?
[01:20:07] That's 23.
[01:20:08] Yeah.
[01:20:09] So you're like a man.
[01:20:10] I was a man-ish.
[01:20:11] Well, I was not really.
[01:20:12] Well, I was like.
[01:20:13] Physically, physically, you were pretty close.
[01:20:14] I think you were 24 when you started BUDS.
[01:20:15] That'd be questionable to the instructors if we were men, right?
[01:20:17] What's that?
[01:20:18] I think you were 24 when you started BUDS.
[01:20:19] I was like, who's counting?
[01:20:21] I don't know.
[01:20:22] All of us run together.
[01:20:23] So you're in pretty good shape.
[01:20:24] You're in good shape.
[01:20:25] I'm in good shape, but this is, this is where I'm getting at.
[01:20:29] So I look around and see these guys and all of a sudden, you know, we start doing the
[01:20:31] in-doc and everybody is just in phenomenal shape.
[01:20:35] They can do pull-ups forever.
[01:20:37] They can run forever.
[01:20:39] You know, I'm still a little heavy.
[01:20:40] So for me, pull-ups, I can do them, but I can't do, like, I was watching guys do like
[01:20:44] 20, 30, 40, 50 at one time or run our class.
[01:20:51] I swear we had at least 10 individuals, you know, Mike Murphy, Nelson Sanchez.
[01:20:56] These guys were running sub 24-minute, four-mile timer.
[01:21:02] Murph and Sanchez would always be like, that's insane.
[01:21:07] It was insane.
[01:21:08] Right?
[01:21:09] And I was, you know, I never, so this was cool about the runs.
[01:21:12] I never, I was in the Goon Squad literally one day, one time.
[01:21:18] Never failed four-mile time run.
[01:21:20] I never got Gooned except the one time.
[01:21:23] So like for me, the running, I did it and I, you know, I got ahead of the Goon Squad,
[01:21:28] but it was miserable, you know.
[01:21:30] What class were you in?
[01:21:32] 236.
[01:21:33] 236.
[01:21:34] Check.
[01:21:35] Yeah.
[01:21:36] And so, so third phase, Jaco.
[01:21:37] So we're in third phase.
[01:21:38] We'll go back to first phase.
[01:21:39] Yeah.
[01:21:40] I was in good shape, but again, I look around and see 175 guys and I was nervous.
[01:21:45] And then after I started seeing guys work out and then guys doing, literally doing splits,
[01:21:49] I'm like, am I in the right place?
[01:21:51] Like these guys are, these are just some freaks here, you know, like Olympic swimmers
[01:21:55] and all these, these, these crazy individuals.
[01:21:58] And then as you know, class starts in the loudest, it is wild.
[01:22:03] It's wild.
[01:22:04] In the loudest screamers, all of a sudden you're like, hey, we're so-and-so.
[01:22:06] He, you know, he talked a lot of shit.
[01:22:07] You can't even comprehend it.
[01:22:10] Like we were talking before we started recording.
[01:22:14] It's like you and I have survivors by us, meaning every friend I have 100% made it through
[01:22:20] buds.
[01:22:21] So as far as I know, the freaking pass rate for buds is 100%.
[01:22:24] So you know, like, oh, everyone made it.
[01:22:25] Everyone, everyone I know made it.
[01:22:27] But yeah, the wild thing is the people that like you said, like Olympic swimmers and Olympic
[01:22:32] this and D won this and D won track guys and D won football players and everything.
[01:22:37] And they all just quit.
[01:22:38] It's insane.
[01:22:39] Yeah.
[01:22:40] They all go away pretty quickly.
[01:22:42] Was there anything in Hell Week that like tripped you up or were you just like, hell
[01:22:46] yeah.
[01:22:47] No, the other reason I say hell yeah for me is because I, I like sucked at everything
[01:22:53] while it sucked.
[01:22:54] I was, I was okay at everything, but I had to put out really hard to pass runs.
[01:22:58] I had to put out really hard to pass the Oakhurst.
[01:23:00] I had to put out really hard to pass the swims.
[01:23:02] And look, everyone's put now, but I had to put, put out really hard to pass the evolutions.
[01:23:06] But in Hell Week, it wasn't, it's not pass fail.
[01:23:09] It's just keep going.
[01:23:11] Which there's anything I'm okay at.
[01:23:13] It's like, oh, I can keep going.
[01:23:15] I will, I will keep going.
[01:23:17] And so for me, Hell Week was almost like a break because you just had to keep going,
[01:23:21] which I was good at everything else.
[01:23:23] Like I did.
[01:23:24] I failed.
[01:23:25] I failed a four mile time.
[01:23:27] I, I paced myself.
[01:23:29] I was an idiot.
[01:23:30] Yeah.
[01:23:31] I mean, I wasn't fast enough to pace.
[01:23:32] I just needed to sprint.
[01:23:33] I failed a swim and again, like a bunch of people failed to swim and I was one of them.
[01:23:37] So that sucked.
[01:23:38] I don't know if I failed in an obstacle course.
[01:23:41] I probably did, but like, so I was kind of middle of the pack, but it was cause I was
[01:23:46] putting out hard.
[01:23:47] So for me, Hell Week was like, cool.
[01:23:49] And a bunch of people quit.
[01:23:51] A bunch of people quit.
[01:23:52] And I was like, damn, are you dumb?
[01:23:55] Like yeah.
[01:23:56] And a lot of those individuals were up front.
[01:23:58] Oh yeah.
[01:23:59] It's insane.
[01:24:00] Yeah.
[01:24:01] We had some pipe hitters.
[01:24:02] Some like legit good, I shouldn't say pipe hitters cause they're not, they're good athletes.
[01:24:05] Right.
[01:24:06] They're good athletes.
[01:24:08] And yeah, it doesn't really matter, man.
[01:24:10] Get tired, wet and cold.
[01:24:11] We had, I mean, we had a bunch of Rangers and Marines in our class.
[01:24:14] We had some Egyptian officers in the class and it was, it was diverse.
[01:24:21] But you know, I, I did have trouble on the runs, but like you, I put out.
[01:24:25] So I had to really put out hard to stay up and pass the runs.
[01:24:31] I couldn't, I couldn't like keep it back a year.
[01:24:34] You know, I had a, I had to really put out, but no, I, everything I did was, um, I did,
[01:24:40] I did okay.
[01:24:41] I remember one time they pulled me out of the log PT because everybody was literally
[01:24:47] just, it was falling on their head and I was just, I don't know, I was in a different gear
[01:24:52] and they're like opponents sit down like a higher gear, like doing better.
[01:24:54] Yeah.
[01:24:55] Yeah.
[01:24:56] I just felt, I felt, I felt good, you know, with the log and they made me sit down one
[01:25:01] time.
[01:25:02] They're like, you know, just sit down because you're, you're, you're doing all right.
[01:25:07] Um, it was one time at how we, I think it was, what was it called, elephant?
[01:25:12] Elephant cage?
[01:25:13] Elephant runs.
[01:25:14] Oh, elephant runs.
[01:25:15] Yeah.
[01:25:16] When you're like holding.
[01:25:17] Yeah.
[01:25:18] So there was, there was one day I was super dehydrated and I remember this and, uh, like
[01:25:20] I thought I was going to die and I kept trying to like pull back.
[01:25:23] So like guys would run and I would, I was literally trying to like pull it back because I couldn't,
[01:25:28] I couldn't keep up.
[01:25:30] And you know, I was getting yelled at.
[01:25:31] I'm like, guys, I don't know what's going on.
[01:25:33] Like I, I can't, I can't do anything right now.
[01:25:36] And I barely made it through that evolution.
[01:25:38] I remember it.
[01:25:39] It was, it was miserable.
[01:25:40] I remember it to this day because you know how it is.
[01:25:43] You just, everybody hits a point, right?
[01:25:44] And I hit that point where I could not, I felt like I couldn't go any further.
[01:25:48] And the only thing that kept me going was like probably the guys behind me, like kicking
[01:25:51] me in the ass.
[01:25:52] Like, Hey dude, like keep going.
[01:25:55] Um, and then there was a, there was a rock hump when we used to do, uh, you know, like
[01:25:59] you used to do the, of course, throw in a pack, whatever it was, three miles.
[01:26:04] There was a time there also that I felt like I was about to like pass out.
[01:26:09] Something was wrong.
[01:26:10] And I remember one of the guys in the class and I remember, never forget this, Ben Souters,
[01:26:14] who you know, a lot of guys made fun of because he grew up in the Midwest and he was a Bible
[01:26:18] beater and he never cursed and he never drank and never did anything.
[01:26:22] He comes running up past me.
[01:26:24] He's like, Hey man, what's, what's wrong with you?
[01:26:25] I said, I don't know.
[01:26:26] I was like, I'm, I'm about to die.
[01:26:29] He's like, I'm going to stay with you and I'm going to, is that cool?
[01:26:32] I'm like, yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:34] He ran with me the whole way until we finished.
[01:26:36] And this was because you were dehydrated or something?
[01:26:38] Yeah, probably just like dehydrated or whatever.
[01:26:40] So those are like the two times I just remember at Bud's where it was like, you're about to,
[01:26:45] you're going to die, you know?
[01:26:47] But other than that, how about dive phase?
[01:26:49] How are you in the pool?
[01:26:51] Cause you surfed.
[01:26:52] I like, yeah, I like the water.
[01:26:53] I think I had some trouble with, um, pool comp with pool comp.
[01:26:58] Like everybody else does.
[01:26:59] Um, my, I think if I remember, I'm exhalation, not almost fricking drowned because I'm like,
[01:27:05] Hey, there's water going in my, my tube here and it's not supposed to be, you know?
[01:27:11] So you come up and like, I'm trying to explain myself to the instructor staff and they just
[01:27:17] jumped all over me.
[01:27:18] I was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, just listen, just hear me out one time.
[01:27:22] I was talking pool comp with Andy stumped the other day up at Jiu-Jitsu camp because
[01:27:26] he was an instructor.
[01:27:27] He was a third phase instructor and you know how that, that, that, he's just like so hilarious.
[01:27:36] And but he's telling me from like his instructor point of view of what he would do and what
[01:27:40] he would see and how he would do it.
[01:27:43] And like he's laughing hysterically.
[01:27:45] Like, and I go, how many people did you, I go, were you like the hard instructor?
[01:27:49] He's like, Oh yeah, I go, how many people did you pass?
[01:27:51] Oh no.
[01:27:52] I said, I said, were you like the hard instructor?
[01:27:54] And he goes, I passed three people three years or four people three years past his pool comp.
[01:28:00] Everyone else failed.
[01:28:01] And he said the guys that passed, he said, I respected him because you know, he put them
[01:28:06] through hell.
[01:28:08] Yeah.
[01:28:09] Andy, we did Andy's podcast and Andy put me through jump training on East Coast.
[01:28:15] And he was, you know, and he knows this.
[01:28:17] He was, he was such a dick to all of us, except if you're in his like his circle, you know,
[01:28:22] but it was cool to see him up in Montana.
[01:28:25] And yeah, it was great.
[01:28:27] Just what he's got going on now.
[01:28:28] And he was awesome.
[01:28:29] He's one of the best, you know, obviously one of the most talented jumpers that I could
[01:28:34] get to.
[01:28:35] And one of the most talented wiseasses.
[01:28:37] Like just so good.
[01:28:39] But yeah, you got to have him debrief you on his experience as a, he was a freaking dive
[01:28:44] instructor, a second phase instructor for like a couple years.
[01:28:48] So he was telling me about how like he'd watched the kids hands and when their hands would
[01:28:53] go into this like involuntary claw like motion and he goes, yeah, that's when I knew I'd
[01:28:58] had him.
[01:28:59] It's like, good God, I cannot imagine him having more fun torturing people, but I guess
[01:29:06] he's doing it.
[01:29:07] And then you're in.
[01:29:08] So then you get to third phase, third phase and third phase I couldn't, couldn't wait
[01:29:14] for I think like most, most guys.
[01:29:16] And yeah, third phase is great.
[01:29:19] The only problems I had there out on the island, we, we made a really shitty hide site for
[01:29:27] like, you know, your, your day that you're supposed to take hours to do it.
[01:29:30] It was, it was so pathetic.
[01:29:32] Jaco that one of the instructors came out, I don't want to say his name, but he lost
[01:29:40] his shit.
[01:29:41] He lost his shit so bad that I think if a, if a, some type of brass was there, they might
[01:29:46] have thrown him in jail.
[01:29:49] He flipped out on us.
[01:29:50] He took one of the students like just threw him every rich direction.
[01:29:54] I think put his boot in the guy's chest and like kicked him a mile, you know, it was one
[01:29:57] of those things.
[01:29:58] We were scared to death and then we worked on that hide for another four hours and chose
[01:30:02] tight.
[01:30:03] But so, but because of that, we had to sleep on the beach.
[01:30:05] It was a camp stupid.
[01:30:06] So I got to sleep at camp stupid, which you really don't sleep because I was getting,
[01:30:12] I was trying to sleep on the ice with those ice plants and ice plants had nothing, but
[01:30:16] some kind of nasty bug that was just biting us all night.
[01:30:20] So we didn't get any sleep.
[01:30:22] Some kind of sand fleece scenario.
[01:30:24] It was bad.
[01:30:25] So, yeah.
[01:30:26] So that was my, my third phase experience and, uh, well also the towers came down.
[01:30:31] Well, then the towers came down.
[01:30:32] So we're up at, um, we're training out East, you know, in the desert and, um, structure
[01:30:39] comes out from the house there and says, Hey, uh, US is being attacked.
[01:30:45] Uh, World Trade Center just got hit by, by an airplane.
[01:30:48] And we all looked at each other and we're like, man, can these fucking guys just leave
[01:30:53] us alone?
[01:30:54] Like we're in third phase.
[01:30:55] We're, this is a conversation.
[01:30:57] We're about to graduate and they're still messing with us.
[01:30:59] Like what did we do wrong?
[01:31:00] Like we, we had a shitty second phase.
[01:31:02] I should, I shouldn't talk about that.
[01:31:04] Um, we had a really shitty second phase, but, um,
[01:31:08] Well, just, I actually did me and, and I'm going to, I'm going to name him, uh, me and,
[01:31:14] me and Jeff boss.
[01:31:15] So he and I are, are swim budding into the bathroom and we go running out and our, our,
[01:31:21] uh, our proctor was a guy by the name of, uh, you know, Favaro money, uh, super laid
[01:31:27] back Sdv guy.
[01:31:29] Like probably the, actually we were told the only instructor that you can't piss off.
[01:31:33] Like it's impossible to piss him off.
[01:31:37] We somehow figured out how to do that because we were running to the bathroom.
[01:31:42] We didn't see him and he called us evidently like three times and we didn't answer and
[01:31:49] he fucking flipped his lid because of that.
[01:31:52] And because the cadre was like, yeah, he doesn't ever flip out.
[01:31:55] Like we've seen him for like 15 years.
[01:31:58] They made us spin the wheel of misfortune every day for this was the first day of second
[01:32:04] phase.
[01:32:05] And every day just you and your swim buddy, no, the whole class, which is even better.
[01:32:09] Right.
[01:32:10] So we got really, we got, we made a lot of friends after that.
[01:32:14] So the wheel of misfortune, I've talked to classes like before and after us.
[01:32:17] Like, oh, we, we spun it like twice, like twice a week or like, no, no, the whole phase.
[01:32:23] I'm like, we spun it every single day.
[01:32:27] We got back from our dive.
[01:32:28] So we'd get back from our dive.
[01:32:29] Didn't matter.
[01:32:30] One o'clock midnight.
[01:32:31] It didn't matter.
[01:32:32] Put all your stuff away.
[01:32:34] Get back in the grinder.
[01:32:35] Spin, you know, spin the wheel of misfortune.
[01:32:37] Oh, 200 eight counts go.
[01:32:39] So we did that every day for second phase, which I was told like never happens.
[01:32:44] And it was just like a miserable second phase because we had to do, you know, more PT for
[01:32:49] like an extra hour or whatever.
[01:32:50] So it sucked.
[01:32:51] Third phase, we're still being harassed.
[01:32:54] We thought it was a joke.
[01:32:55] They march us in.
[01:32:56] We watch it on TV for 30 seconds.
[01:32:59] We marched back out to the grinder and we just didn't have any idea what was about to
[01:33:04] happen.
[01:33:05] The cadre, their demeanor was completely different.
[01:33:10] I'm getting chills, you know, talking about it.
[01:33:12] But you can tell like they knew what was about to happen.
[01:33:16] And I remember them like having this like hatred and just, you know, like we're about
[01:33:22] to go to war guys.
[01:33:23] And we're just like, no, we're out here.
[01:33:25] We're in buds.
[01:33:26] We're on the beach.
[01:33:27] We're working out.
[01:33:29] And the demeanor from the class, which is all we want to do is get through buds.
[01:33:32] This sucks.
[01:33:33] From their demeanor, which was like, we're going to war.
[01:33:37] Like this is what's happening.
[01:33:38] And it was totally different.
[01:33:40] And from that day forward, from the last part of third phase, like they were serious.
[01:33:44] It wasn't more of this like joking crew of cadre.
[01:33:48] Like they were like, this was real.
[01:33:53] This was not the shit, you know, that, in all honesty, that some people signed up for.
[01:33:59] I mean, there was, right after that, there was a few guys from SQT.
[01:34:03] And one, in one in particular, I remember quit in SQT.
[01:34:05] It was like, I didn't sign up to go to war, you know, with the college and whatever.
[01:34:09] So I think some people, this was like, obviously a big reality check for us.
[01:34:13] I don't think we knew any different because we were just trying to get through buds.
[01:34:17] So damn.
[01:34:18] So Amber, this whole time your new husband is coming home freaking with the shit beat
[01:34:25] out of him.
[01:34:26] And he's working crazy hours and all this.
[01:34:29] Like what's your, what's your impression of this whole scenario before September 11th?
[01:34:35] I really jockeau thought we just have to get to the end of buds.
[01:34:39] I literally thought after the six months of training, things are going to really even
[01:34:42] out.
[01:34:43] I mean, even minus nine, 11, that, you know, nothing could have been further from the truth.
[01:34:49] But in my mind, that was like at least something that was an end goal.
[01:34:52] And so all of the late nights and ice baths and I don't, I just need to stay on the couch
[01:34:59] all weekend.
[01:35:00] Like that to me was going to come to an end and life was going to be normal again.
[01:35:04] It's also some of the sweetest times because he was so spent and I look back at photos
[01:35:11] of our one year old climbing all over him and he's got both knees, you know, wrapped
[01:35:16] with ice and he's trying to be a dad.
[01:35:19] And, you know, we've got pictures at the zoo and I can see how beat down he was being
[01:35:25] a bud student and trying to be a dad.
[01:35:27] He came home one night on our anniversary and it was like, you know, midnight, like he'd
[01:35:32] missed the anniversary and he had geraniums picked from our apartment complex.
[01:35:37] And it was the sweetest thing.
[01:35:38] Like he was still trying so hard to be sort of this dual role.
[01:35:44] And after nine, 11, like it's like cadre.
[01:35:47] I mean, he completely changed.
[01:35:49] And what about, did you realize what an impact September 11th was going to have from the
[01:35:57] perspective of when I was going in the SEAL teams and it was 1990, 1991.
[01:36:03] I thought I was going to Vietnam.
[01:36:05] I thought I was going to Vietnam.
[01:36:06] Like I thought, hey, there's SEALs just sneaking around the world, just killing people.
[01:36:10] And that's what I was going to be doing.
[01:36:12] So I just thought that's the way the SEAL teams was.
[01:36:14] That's what you did.
[01:36:15] Then I got to the SEAL teams and it wasn't like that in the 90s.
[01:36:19] It was not like that at all.
[01:36:21] So did you have the impression like, hey, he's going to war anyways?
[01:36:24] Or were you like, oh, once this is, once he gets done with the SEAL training, we're going
[01:36:28] to be, you know, able to just kind of live normal lives.
[01:36:31] But now this September 11th happens.
[01:36:35] I didn't know what had happened because I went from being an independent sophomore to
[01:36:42] a pregnant college student to a wife and a mom.
[01:36:46] And now 9-11 happens.
[01:36:48] And my birthday is on September 12th today.
[01:36:54] And thank you.
[01:36:56] My mom had come to visit in 2001.
[01:36:59] Yeah, 2000, 9-11.
[01:37:03] Oh my gosh.
[01:37:05] It's 21 years.
[01:37:06] Okay.
[01:37:07] Yeah.
[01:37:08] Sorry.
[01:37:09] 01.
[01:37:10] Yes.
[01:37:11] Anyway, my mom had come to visit and I remember telling her like, I think he's at war.
[01:37:18] Like, I think he's gone.
[01:37:19] He was on the island.
[01:37:20] I had no idea.
[01:37:21] I'm like, I think he's probably going to leave like today.
[01:37:24] And we also, it was just a crazy time.
[01:37:28] I had no idea how much it would.
[01:37:32] Yeah, I think anybody's dead.
[01:37:33] Yeah.
[01:37:34] Even, I mean, from my perspective, I had been in the SEAL teams for like 10 years at this
[01:37:38] point and, you know, you thought like everyone was, I was paranoid that, you know, I wasn't
[01:37:45] going to get any.
[01:37:46] I wasn't going to miss it.
[01:37:47] It was going to be over.
[01:37:48] Like everyone was feeling like that.
[01:37:51] And because it seemed like it would last for, you know what, six months, maybe, maybe.
[01:37:56] I wouldn't even, I was about to say maybe a year, but I don't think anyone thought,
[01:37:59] oh, this is going to go on for a full year.
[01:38:02] Like we would do some strikes.
[01:38:04] We would do some hits, take out some targets.
[01:38:06] And then that would be that.
[01:38:08] I would love to hear someone tell me that they knew it was going to last 20 freaking years.
[01:38:13] I would, I would be very suspect.
[01:38:16] Now I did have some officer, senior officer friends of me that said, when I was like,
[01:38:21] hey, get me back to a team, please now.
[01:38:23] They were like, hey, this is going to go on a while.
[01:38:26] I'll give them credit for, for thinking that and for telling me that.
[01:38:29] But almost everybody was like, oh, we need to get over now.
[01:38:35] If you don't get it now, it'll be another, you know, because the first goal for you,
[01:38:38] but you kind of based some stuff off the first goal for, which was 72 hours.
[01:38:42] Yeah.
[01:38:43] It was 72 hours.
[01:38:45] And then you could say, oh, this is going to end in Ukraine, right?
[01:38:49] Right away, everyone said, oh, this is going to end.
[01:38:51] It's going to be a month.
[01:38:52] Yeah.
[01:38:53] And now it's like, wait a minute.
[01:38:54] Yeah.
[01:38:55] Oh, wait a minute.
[01:38:56] It's a it's it's a lot different.
[01:38:57] Yeah.
[01:38:58] So I think that everybody in the community, no one, no one that I talked to was like,
[01:39:03] oh, this is going to last two decades.
[01:39:05] That wasn't even a thought.
[01:39:11] Did you go to SQT on the West Coast?
[01:39:13] Yes.
[01:39:14] So you did like the group SQT.
[01:39:16] That was like, I think I was the first, I think it was the second class where they didn't
[01:39:20] do the STT anymore.
[01:39:22] Everyone did SQT.
[01:39:23] You didn't get your, well, actually you got your, you got your Trident when you graduated
[01:39:27] SQT.
[01:39:28] Oh, so that was that was your class?
[01:39:29] That was the class, I think before us.
[01:39:31] I think it was like, it was, was it like, yeah, like Goggins and Brent.
[01:39:39] I know it was relatively new.
[01:39:42] And I remember to jog out thinking like, I'm so happy that he's going to get to do something
[01:39:49] with all this training because, you know, sales during times of peace versus, you know,
[01:39:57] 9-11 on, I'm sure it's a very different way of living and deploying and being.
[01:40:04] And I just thought like, I know it's been a, you know, it's been peaceful times for a
[01:40:08] while and good for him.
[01:40:10] I'm glad that he gets to actually utilize this training.
[01:40:15] And I also remember thinking, seals are so incredible.
[01:40:18] They, nothing, you know, they don't die.
[01:40:20] I guess you, you know, you hadn't heard.
[01:40:22] And I was, my thinking back then was so naive, but I never was afraid like he can't do this
[01:40:29] anymore or I was actually very, I was afraid, but I wasn't thinking that I needed to intervene.
[01:40:36] I was very supportive of, you know, of him deploying.
[01:40:41] Yeah.
[01:40:43] That's so crazy because you're young.
[01:40:46] We're all, I mean, I think I saw us in the Navy for 13 years before I shot my weapon
[01:40:51] at the enemy.
[01:40:52] So 13 years that you're talking about like this peace time.
[01:40:55] And I actually, it was awesome.
[01:40:57] Like I had a great time.
[01:40:58] Like we worked hard, we trained hard, we were hanging out with our friends.
[01:41:03] We were trying to be ready for combat, which was the big thing that we didn't know and
[01:41:06] didn't understand.
[01:41:07] So you're kind of preparing for something that you don't really, that you really don't
[01:41:10] understand.
[01:41:11] But I really loved the job of being a seal, even if the job is just going out and going
[01:41:16] into the desert and doing desert warfare training.
[01:41:18] I love that job.
[01:41:19] It's an awesome job.
[01:41:21] But I mean, what you're talking about, Amber, like the fact that you feel that as like a
[01:41:26] mom and a wife, even you felt like I'm glad he's going to get to do his job.
[01:41:31] Imagine what the dudes are like.
[01:41:32] The dudes are like, oh, you know, it was, it was.
[01:41:36] I mean, we used to, I hate saying this because it sounds so freaking horrible, but we used
[01:41:41] to like pray for war, like just want to go to war so bad.
[01:41:44] We just, that's what we wanted to do.
[01:41:47] And yeah, it's, we got, we got what we asked for.
[01:41:53] We got what we asked for.
[01:41:55] I was going to ask you about SQT.
[01:41:58] So you go through SQT.
[01:42:01] And now that must have been, those dudes must have been like fully full on like we're going
[01:42:06] to war.
[01:42:07] You guys are all going to war.
[01:42:08] Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:09] It was, it was weird too.
[01:42:10] It was like a transition.
[01:42:11] So they're ringing guys in that had just gone overseas and done something and like after
[01:42:17] actions.
[01:42:18] And so like all of a sudden the shift started changing from like H gear to stuff that actually,
[01:42:23] you know, fits you and works.
[01:42:24] And we also had, I think 11, 11 guys in the SQT class that came back that had gotten out
[01:42:34] right after 9 11.
[01:42:35] They came back in.
[01:42:36] So we had all these guys that were team guys before went out in the private sector.
[01:42:40] Like, oh, 9 11.
[01:42:41] That's your point, Amber.
[01:42:42] Like, can you imagine you're a dude, you're in the team for four years or six years, you
[01:42:45] get out of the teams, you're going out, you're doing whatever you're doing outside the war
[01:42:49] kicks off.
[01:42:50] You're like, I'm going back in.
[01:42:51] I'm throwing everything I have away all built up, whatever I'm going back in.
[01:42:53] Because that's what dudes wanted to do.
[01:42:56] Exactly.
[01:42:57] So you get your tried at the end of SQT.
[01:43:00] What team did you go to?
[01:43:02] I went to 10.
[01:43:03] They just commissioned 10 and seven.
[01:43:05] So half the class went to seven or STV one and then half of us went to 10.
[01:43:12] Did you keep your try date when you got there?
[01:43:14] Because I know I heard some good stories like some teams were taking your try date and painting
[01:43:19] it blue.
[01:43:20] So it was inert.
[01:43:21] Two and four?
[01:43:22] Two and four?
[01:43:23] Yeah.
[01:43:24] Like you showed up, you didn't have it.
[01:43:25] You got it ripped off.
[01:43:26] I think as soon as you came across the quarter deck, they just ripped it off.
[01:43:28] I want to say somebody at STV was telling me they took their Tridents and put them into
[01:43:31] a bird cage.
[01:43:32] That's what they did on the East Coast.
[01:43:33] So they put them in bird cages.
[01:43:35] You can look at it, but you can't have it.
[01:43:38] And of course the guys who struggled, they had to keep their Tridents in the bird cage
[01:43:45] a lot longer than guys that were squared away.
[01:43:49] But we did get beat into our chest from the instructor staff at SQT while all the families
[01:43:56] were there and stuff.
[01:43:57] So that was, at least we felt like it was something there, but maybe not so much compared
[01:44:03] to how it used to be.
[01:44:04] Compared to how it used to be.
[01:44:05] Yeah, it was cool.
[01:44:06] I checked into the team and we went through something called SEAL tactical training at
[01:44:10] the team and they did a board with the senior people in each department.
[01:44:18] But man, the training that the guys get now, the training that you got, this centralized
[01:44:23] training with all the experience, all consolidated, it's awesome.
[01:44:28] There's no doubt.
[01:44:29] I think they're coming out of, I don't know if they're, they might be coming out of Buds
[01:44:33] now, not just SQT.
[01:44:34] I think Buds with like four weeks of CQC training.
[01:44:39] Compared to you wouldn't even see it until you're at a team six months down the road
[01:44:42] that you went to Shaw's for two weeks.
[01:44:44] Yeah, and the thing is, like when you were talking about guys coming back from like combat
[01:44:49] deployments and getting in there, and that's cool, right?
[01:44:51] That's awesome.
[01:44:52] But imagine like it turned into, hey, these guys were in sustained combat operations for
[01:45:00] years.
[01:45:01] Cause I remember in the nineties, like if a guy did a mission, like singular, like one
[01:45:07] mission, it was like, Hey, do this guy's combat experience.
[01:45:10] And like they had this thing that you didn't, you know, like I had a platoon commander who
[01:45:16] was an awesome guy and he had been in Grenada and was like, you know, he had, he had slayed
[01:45:22] the dragon and we were all just looking at him like, yeah, he was the coolest guy ever.
[01:45:26] We had first phase instructor was on the train up in Bosnia.
[01:45:29] Oh, you know, yeah.
[01:45:31] I was like, there was a gunshot like, like five miles away.
[01:45:35] Yeah.
[01:45:36] And then he was like shooting an animal and like that was contact left.
[01:45:40] You're getting debriefed on it.
[01:45:42] Not judging anyone that was there.
[01:45:44] Just passing, passing gouge.
[01:45:47] You did what you were, what the country asked you to do.
[01:45:49] So you get into a, you get, you show up at the team now, you go right into a platoon.
[01:45:53] Is that the right phone now?
[01:45:54] Right into a platoon.
[01:45:55] Yeah.
[01:45:56] What's your job?
[01:45:57] Did you just get handed a 60 or what?
[01:45:58] How did you guess?
[01:45:59] You didn't think I'd be like the comms guy or, I got handed a 60 just cause I couldn't
[01:46:04] wait as I give me to please, um, I couldn't wait to be a 60 on it actually.
[01:46:08] Did you get a mark 48 or did you get a 60?
[01:46:10] I guess 60 sweet.
[01:46:11] Yeah.
[01:46:12] By the way, Marcus had never shot a weapon before, before going.
[01:46:17] No, we didn't.
[01:46:18] I didn't.
[01:46:19] Yeah.
[01:46:20] I mean, I was like said, I grew up.
[01:46:21] Yeah.
[01:46:22] I grew up playing, playing ball.
[01:46:23] Well, the cool thing is no bad habits.
[01:46:25] Good hand eye coordination because you were an athlete.
[01:46:27] Like that's all points to you probably being a pretty good shot and everything.
[01:46:30] I was, I was a better pistol shot.
[01:46:31] I picked that up quickly, immediately rifle took me a while to get proficient at it.
[01:46:37] And even when I went over to, to a depth group, you know, I never struggled with it, but like
[01:46:42] the pistol, I was, I was a really good pistol shot and quick and faster than everybody.
[01:46:48] But the rifle, like I was like middle of the road.
[01:46:51] I had, I struggled with it actually early on.
[01:46:53] Um, I remember out at Shaw's the, uh, with the guys out there, Ross and just coming over
[01:46:59] and saying, Hey, you know, just, you know, don't, don't put your magazine on the car.
[01:47:03] And like, this is a bunch of things that like, he's like, I can work on.
[01:47:06] But soon as he worked like with me, you know, I went from being pretty like not good to,
[01:47:12] to, to excelling.
[01:47:13] Um, but it took me a while and I tell people, I was like, no, I actually had to like really
[01:47:17] focus and practice and like stay late or, you know, go out to the range in the evening
[01:47:21] when guys were like hanging it up because I just, there was just something not right
[01:47:25] about not being proficient at it.
[01:47:28] Right.
[01:47:29] Like I want to actually be good.
[01:47:31] Uh, I don't want to just hang it up and, and, and walk away.
[01:47:33] So I got, I got decent at shooting a, a, a, um, you know, a rifle.
[01:47:40] What year was it when you checked into team 10?
[01:47:43] 2002, like April.
[01:47:46] And do you, do you know where you're going on deployment?
[01:47:48] No, nothing.
[01:47:49] We didn't know anything yet.
[01:47:50] They were, oh, cause the world was still just chaos.
[01:47:51] Yeah.
[01:47:52] It was chaos and new team, like they were just going through, you know, growing pains, I
[01:47:56] think.
[01:47:57] And so we didn't know anything.
[01:47:58] And my, my first deployment actually went over to Germany and just got your UCOM on.
[01:48:03] We got our UCOM on.
[01:48:05] Um, yeah.
[01:48:07] And that was, that was whatever.
[01:48:09] Right.
[01:48:10] Just train more training.
[01:48:11] Yeah.
[01:48:12] And the frustration level is everyone just going nuts.
[01:48:13] Like, oh, it's insane.
[01:48:15] The people that were getting out like after, you know, soon as a platoon wouldn't go to,
[01:48:21] um, you know, Iraq or Afghanistan, like guys were getting, you know, you saw it out here.
[01:48:25] Guys were getting out immediately, you know, they were jumping into Blackwater and all
[01:48:29] these other places.
[01:48:30] Um, I saw a lot of it.
[01:48:31] And the guys get out to one, one platoon because they weren't, you know, cause you'd
[01:48:34] hear about like these Rangers and SF and like all these guys are going down range.
[01:48:38] And you know, you're like, what, I'm fucking going to Germany to do what?
[01:48:41] Like, yeah, just went to Bud's and SQT and it did a two year workup.
[01:48:46] And what is this for?
[01:48:47] You told me I'm like, good, you know, maybe that was garbage.
[01:48:50] Yeah.
[01:48:51] And plus you had that feeling that this whole thing's going to be over like really quick.
[01:48:54] And I bet if I don't get it now, if I don't get out and go work for a contractor, my
[01:48:57] ancestors are just horrible.
[01:48:59] Well, how are you, how are you liking the team life?
[01:49:02] Amber?
[01:49:03] You know, I didn't mind it.
[01:49:06] I realized really early on that there was a pretty clear distinction in the wives that,
[01:49:12] you know, it was probably best to keep one foot in, but don't try to, you know, jump in
[01:49:17] full throttle and don't stay completely away.
[01:49:20] I saw that there were women that were very angry and resentful towards their husbands.
[01:49:28] And I felt like there were women that were really supportive and I always wanted to be
[01:49:32] supportive.
[01:49:34] I also felt like, you know, it, it was not something that I wanted to necessarily make
[01:49:40] my life about, but I wanted to support Marcus enough that I knew what was going on within
[01:49:45] the community.
[01:49:46] And so it was good.
[01:49:47] And you know, we had two kids at that point.
[01:49:49] I had, yeah, I got pregnant with our daughter when Marcus was in, was December of 2001, right
[01:49:56] after 9-11.
[01:49:58] So we had two kids when he checked into his first platoon and he was pretty much gone
[01:50:03] all the time.
[01:50:04] Yeah.
[01:50:05] So, no, no, no, no, we had, no, I was at, I was at lead climber when you were like nine.
[01:50:12] I was overdue.
[01:50:13] You got home on my due date and then I ended up being five days overdue.
[01:50:16] But, um, yeah, he was at lead climber and I'm like, can you tell them that you're having
[01:50:20] a baby and he's like, no, no, I can't.
[01:50:24] She's literally ready to burst and I'm like five hours away.
[01:50:29] It's just like, it's such a, you know, the way, it's the way, it's the way.
[01:50:32] I'm like, if you're deployed, that's one thing, but you're in West Virginia.
[01:50:35] I'm in Virginia.
[01:50:37] He had, you know, no cell phone.
[01:50:39] There was one cell phone.
[01:50:40] No, a pay phone.
[01:50:41] You walk to and he would call and be like, have you had the baby yet?
[01:50:45] So he got home on my due date, but I ended up being a little overdue and, um, yeah, I
[01:50:48] was just gone all the time.
[01:50:50] It was really actually hard.
[01:50:52] I was an only child.
[01:50:53] So there was part of me that really, you know, I was raised an only child.
[01:50:56] So it was part of me that did love that independence and didn't need him around, but it did get
[01:51:00] lonely.
[01:51:01] And I was now with two little kids away and I was meeting wives, but it was, you know,
[01:51:06] there's, there's just, there was a lot of like, I don't know what schools have your,
[01:51:10] has your husband been to, what's your husband's rank?
[01:51:13] I don't ever, I've never played that sort of like living through, getting validity through
[01:51:18] your husband's career.
[01:51:20] Marcus was always like, you know, my reputation means a lot to me.
[01:51:24] And so don't ever do anything that would embarrass me in the community.
[01:51:28] Like don't risk my reputation.
[01:51:29] I really respected that.
[01:51:31] Yeah.
[01:51:32] Yeah.
[01:51:33] Um, my wife was due with our first kid and my exo, who's a prior on this, the guy who's
[01:51:39] an awesome guy.
[01:51:40] This is at SEAL team too.
[01:51:42] He's like, so when's your baby due?
[01:51:43] And I was like, Oh, you know, like September or something.
[01:51:46] And he's like, Oh, when are you supposed to go on deployment?
[01:51:50] I'm like, uh, August something.
[01:51:52] He's like, he's like, you're not going.
[01:51:54] I was like, yeah, sir.
[01:51:55] No, I'm going on deployment.
[01:51:56] And he's like, yeah, you're not.
[01:51:57] And I was like, sir, I'm definitely going on deployment.
[01:51:59] Like I'm not, I'm, I'm definitely going.
[01:52:01] He's like, you are definitely not going.
[01:52:03] And so he literally said, Hey, you can go on deployment as soon as she has that baby.
[01:52:06] And that's what I did.
[01:52:07] And I missed about a week and a half of deployment.
[01:52:09] He had the baby and I left the next day, which was probably, I mean, at least I was there.
[01:52:17] But the attitude from me was just like, no, it's like first baby, whatever.
[01:52:21] Like I got him going on deployment.
[01:52:23] That's just, that's just the way it is.
[01:52:27] I mean, so like for you to be like, no, you know, I'm not coming home.
[01:52:31] I'm at, I'm at a school right now and I'm not coming home.
[01:52:34] That's the way it is.
[01:52:35] Like it's just the, the normal thing.
[01:52:37] And then I remember I, I told my wife, God bless her.
[01:52:44] She called me at work and I don't, I don't, I forget what was going on, but she called
[01:52:51] me at work and my chief was like, Hey, John, call your wife's on the phone.
[01:52:57] And I remember I pick up the phone and I go, what?
[01:53:00] And you could tell she was like so apologetic because it's this, I put, probably put the
[01:53:05] same freaking psycho pressure on my wife that, that Marcus put on you.
[01:53:09] Like, don't, you know, don't mess.
[01:53:12] Don't embarrass you.
[01:53:14] And so I was like, what?
[01:53:16] And she's like, you know, and I go, okay.
[01:53:18] And that was it.
[01:53:19] Like hung up, like a total jerk.
[01:53:21] I'm a total savage.
[01:53:23] So I'm sorry darling about that.
[01:53:26] But what I'm saying is like, that's just the normal thing.
[01:53:29] Like you, you just, you're in the team.
[01:53:31] You all about the team.
[01:53:32] Everything's the teams.
[01:53:34] And it sucks to be married to those dudes, I think in a lot of way.
[01:53:38] It does.
[01:53:39] But there was also the shared sort of like aggression, if you will, for lack of a better
[01:53:44] term that I understood that he needed to be so focused.
[01:53:48] And I was just pissed after the, the attacks of 9 11.
[01:53:52] And I just thought like, yeah, get over there and like do whatever you do.
[01:53:56] But, oh yeah.
[01:53:57] Yeah.
[01:53:58] Go do it.
[01:53:59] Just I don't want to know about it, but go do it.
[01:54:00] Like I knew that the teams always came first and I accepted that because I knew that it
[01:54:04] was a short period of our lives and it needed to be done.
[01:54:12] So your first deployment, you go to, go to Germany.
[01:54:15] You're sitting over there.
[01:54:16] So why the hell are we doing this?
[01:54:18] You get back and you roll into another platoon.
[01:54:21] What's, are you going to be a 60 gunner again?
[01:54:23] What's up?
[01:54:24] Absolutely.
[01:54:25] I asked for it.
[01:54:26] But I think at that time, then we were, I was carrying a mark, I was carrying a 48.
[01:54:31] Got that mark 48.
[01:54:32] Nice.
[01:54:33] 46 too.
[01:54:34] Yeah.
[01:54:35] So that was good.
[01:54:36] We, you know, that was my, my task unit was, was redling.
[01:54:40] So, you know, we, you know, we worked up together.
[01:54:45] We flipped the coin, you know, in the previous platoon basically got to go to Afghanistan
[01:54:52] first.
[01:54:53] We go to Germany first.
[01:54:54] Oh, so when we were ripping out like halfway through to get guys more exposure.
[01:54:59] Yep.
[01:55:00] So literally over a coin toss and so those guys went down range and we went to, you know,
[01:55:05] we went to Germany and then, you know, the rest is kind of history.
[01:55:10] And once the Hilo went down, we actually deployed a week later because, you know, they were
[01:55:14] a wreck.
[01:55:15] They were a wreck.
[01:55:16] I mean, half the, half the two was gone and the other guys were, you know, not good.
[01:55:21] How do you, how do you guys get word?
[01:55:23] What are you guys doing?
[01:55:24] It was terrible how we got word.
[01:55:26] We actually got word from, from them.
[01:55:29] So here we are.
[01:55:30] We're forward deployed in Germany, actually a unit.
[01:55:34] And we got to find out from our spouses that there's guys in full military dress showing
[01:55:45] up at people's doors.
[01:55:46] Like that's how we found out.
[01:55:48] So it was, that was a rough couple of days.
[01:55:51] It went on though.
[01:55:52] And the communication wasn't a whole lot better back in Virginia Beach because they
[01:55:56] were still searching for Marcus LaTrell.
[01:55:58] And you know, that went on for like what almost a week.
[01:56:02] And you know, no one knew if their husband was on the helicopter or not.
[01:56:07] And the ones that survived weren't allowed to call home.
[01:56:10] And so it was literally pins and needles and they weren't hearing much more.
[01:56:15] But then when the Knox started coming, they were finding out.
[01:56:20] Yeah, I remember being on the phone with you and you like screaming crying because like
[01:56:25] somebody was like somebody showed up to the door.
[01:56:28] Like they were all, you know, when we were together and stuff.
[01:56:30] So it was, that was like a just a shitty, you know, just a shitty time, I think for
[01:56:34] everybody in the community.
[01:56:35] As you know, didn't really, didn't experience a loss like that.
[01:56:40] So it was really difficult how people were handling it.
[01:56:44] When those guys got back to Germany, I think they flew in a psych to like meet with everybody
[01:56:49] for 30 minutes.
[01:56:50] First guy went in there and didn't come out for almost three hours.
[01:56:54] So they were, they were trying, they were going to, they gave each guy 30 minutes to
[01:56:56] talk to psych.
[01:56:57] And the first guy went in and come out for three hours.
[01:56:59] So it was just one of those things that I don't think anybody even knew how to prepare
[01:57:03] or what to do.
[01:57:04] And so it was just a bit, you know, it was a bit rough for a while.
[01:57:07] But again, once we got like over that week, got our heads back straight, we were like,
[01:57:14] get us over there yesterday.
[01:57:15] Like, why are we still sitting here?
[01:57:17] But we did.
[01:57:18] And within a week, we were in country and we were already, we were doing our first mission
[01:57:21] like within the first couple of days.
[01:57:22] So.
[01:57:23] And then what were you guys doing?
[01:57:24] What was like your mission set?
[01:57:25] Mission was going after different like, like different cells, different Taliban cells that
[01:57:30] were, but like larger, it was almost like a little bit different.
[01:57:35] Wasn't like CT missions, even though we did like a CT op, right?
[01:57:38] Like initially the first stop was like a no shit, like it's probably the coolest op ever.
[01:57:43] Like, you know, black hawks come in, ropes go out, you know, fast rope, you know, charge
[01:57:48] on the gate, like boom, everybody, you know, like it was like a real op.
[01:57:52] And then because that was done at night, it got shut down and the whole country then got
[01:57:58] shut down because you're not allowed to go after bad guys at night because that's not
[01:58:02] nice.
[01:58:05] So that's what we were dealing with in, in, you know, in Afghanistan at the time.
[01:58:09] So then we started just, you know, going out to in the daytime chasing different, different
[01:58:17] groups like in valleys and we were working with the Kansafs or the Canadians who were
[01:58:21] like men compared to us.
[01:58:23] They were like, they look like Vikings, but they wore way too much gear.
[01:58:27] And we had to tell them to like, like, dude, you're going out in the mountain for three
[01:58:30] days and you got six, nine mil mags on your body.
[01:58:33] Do you think you're going to use six, nine mil mags?
[01:58:35] I really hope you don't need to use six, nine mil mags.
[01:58:38] So, you know, shit like that.
[01:58:39] But, but so that's what we were doing.
[01:58:42] And what's your job in the platoon?
[01:58:45] I was a Air Ops lead breacher.
[01:58:48] And so I, you know, in a fire team later.
[01:58:53] And yeah, it got, we had a good, like I would say good, good deployment.
[01:58:59] It was a really spicy deployment.
[01:59:01] I mean, we had like multiple engagements.
[01:59:06] We had our chief got, we got lit up by a army Apache, which was wild because like that
[01:59:15] was not supposed to, obviously it wasn't supposed to happen.
[01:59:17] It was a big deal because it was, it was daytime.
[01:59:22] Still don't know how they didn't recognize us full on engagement, like full on gun run,
[01:59:28] not just like, oh, there might be a position of more, like we were, we were engaging a
[01:59:33] small group that was engaging us.
[01:59:36] And we were, it was like five of us and maybe three of them.
[01:59:40] And we were starting to bound forward, like from cover to cover.
[01:59:44] And you know, I actually, I was a patrolman with a, with a saw.
[01:59:48] So it was a little bit lighter.
[01:59:49] And I just remember just like, just fucking going off on that thing.
[01:59:53] It was awesome.
[01:59:55] And then I remember hearing this deep, like deep, deep sound of just like, doot, doot,
[02:00:04] doot, doot, doot.
[02:00:05] I'm like, what the fuck is that?
[02:00:06] And literally in the middle of this little valley, and it was, it was not wide, I turn
[02:00:11] around and this army, this Apache is in a full on like front till gun run.
[02:00:20] And I literally thought it was a movie.
[02:00:22] Like you saw like the dirt and the, you know, whatever there was a 20 millimeter maybe.
[02:00:28] It was just coming straight at me.
[02:00:30] And I'm like, you know, all this happened so fast.
[02:00:32] I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?
[02:00:34] Like we're getting engaged by our own guys.
[02:00:37] And so it's come, it's tearing ass.
[02:00:40] We all dive out of the way.
[02:00:41] I remember diving behind rocks and watching my chief do a full on like dive, like into
[02:00:47] rocks, like did not give a fuck.
[02:00:50] And the thing comes tearing through.
[02:00:53] You can't see anything because dust everywhere.
[02:00:55] He wound up getting hit in the face.
[02:00:56] Well, the way they were working gun runs then is that dash one would come in and do 20 millimeter
[02:01:03] guns, you know what dash two is coming in with next, right?
[02:01:07] 2.5 rockets.
[02:01:09] And so I just get this rock and I just huddle up and I'm like, this is fucking it.
[02:01:14] Like I may live, but like I'm going to get fucked up.
[02:01:17] I'm going to get fracked here because like we've been calling in gun runs all day long
[02:01:21] into caves and like we get, we get engaged.
[02:01:24] We pull back, calling some guns, move forward.
[02:01:27] That's what kind of mission it was through the mountains there.
[02:01:30] And so I was just waiting.
[02:01:31] I was like huddled up and like, oh, this is it.
[02:01:32] We're going to get, I'm going to get sprayed.
[02:01:34] Hopefully it's not bad.
[02:01:35] Like I was like trying to cover up my face thinking like, okay, if I just get wounded,
[02:01:39] you know, it'll be okay, but just not my face or my head.
[02:01:43] And the second one just comes tearing through and doesn't fire anything.
[02:01:46] But I could see them.
[02:01:47] I could literally see them and they were so low.
[02:01:50] So somebody who, who didn't have their head up their ass was able to move over to fires
[02:01:55] and call it off.
[02:01:57] Somebody cleared them hot.
[02:01:58] I still don't know to this day and we still talk about it because like it was a fuck up.
[02:02:03] You know, it was a bad fuck up.
[02:02:04] How bad was your chief wounded?
[02:02:06] He his whole face was like, um, like you couldn't, it wasn't bad, bad, like, but it was like,
[02:02:12] if you took a picture, you almost unrecognizable because the, I guess the frag going that fast
[02:02:17] was so fast.
[02:02:18] It just kind of blew his face up and he was like, like spit in blood a little bit, but
[02:02:23] he honestly was fine.
[02:02:25] Yeah.
[02:02:26] Yeah.
[02:02:27] Like let's be real.
[02:02:28] Yeah.
[02:02:29] Yeah.
[02:02:30] Yeah.
[02:02:31] Yeah.
[02:02:32] Yeah.
[02:02:33] Oh, 100%.
[02:02:34] Like, you know, looking back, you're like, but, um, yeah, that was a big deal.
[02:02:35] I just remember, I think when we got back and again, I was a E, but I think E five at
[02:02:37] the time, maybe six, you know, so I was, I was tucked away, but I think the leadership
[02:02:41] got in the ass of, of that unit, you know, over it, um, over at C. just so it was like,
[02:02:48] what, what happened there?
[02:02:49] You know, who caught first of who, who cleared them hot?
[02:02:53] You know, we were on the offensive.
[02:02:54] It was just a, it was a total mess.
[02:02:56] When I was a young radio man, I was standing out in the desert in Fallon, Nevada, trying
[02:03:00] to call in for an extract from a helicopter to helicopters.
[02:03:04] And I'm sitting there and I'm looking, they're, they're like, maybe a couple hundred feet
[02:03:09] at altitude and I, I'm just standing there making columns of them.
[02:03:13] Like, Hey, you know, we're ready for extract and they couldn't see me.
[02:03:16] And I was like, this is crazy.
[02:03:17] I started like waving my arms.
[02:03:19] They still can't see me.
[02:03:20] And finally, uh, you know, I'm like, I'm getting a bearing and I'm like, Hey, I'm right over
[02:03:24] here to your Southwest and they just can't see me.
[02:03:26] And finally I like pop or whatever, pop of smoke and I mark you identifying, blah, blah,
[02:03:30] blah.
[02:03:31] But it showed me that when you're in the air, like things just look so totally different
[02:03:37] and, uh, they can't see shit and they're moving freaking 150 miles an hour.
[02:03:44] And they get told like, you're cleared hot.
[02:03:46] Guess what?
[02:03:47] They're going to freaking shoot, man.
[02:03:48] Um, cause a lot of times they're saving your ass.
[02:03:50] They're saving someone's ass too.
[02:03:52] Yeah.
[02:03:53] And you know, there's like, I mean, you know, all the blue and blue that was happening just
[02:03:56] everywhere.
[02:03:57] And again, it's not, you know, of course it's not nefarious.
[02:03:59] It just, it happens just like that.
[02:04:01] Yeah.
[02:04:02] Um, but we had, uh, as I'm sure, you know, you did, uh, we were in day, you know, day
[02:04:07] panels and I popped out immediately and they were like, are you fucking kidding me guys?
[02:04:12] Like we can't see a day panel that's cut up out of your shoulder.
[02:04:15] So like the lesson learned that day forward was like, no, no, you got to carry a full
[02:04:18] day panel and like busted out.
[02:04:21] And you know, because that's the only thing that you said, that's the only thing we can
[02:04:24] see.
[02:04:25] There's no way we can see that little thing on your shoulder.
[02:04:27] You know, so, uh, incredible lessons learned.
[02:04:32] Um, and, and so that, that deployment wraps up.
[02:04:36] Um, but I mean, you lost freaking so many guys from your task.
[02:04:42] Good guys.
[02:04:43] Yeah.
[02:04:44] Couple of buds mates and yeah, it was wild.
[02:04:46] I mean, matter of fact, right before we deployed right after the healer, well, not right after
[02:04:51] the healer went down, but they flew, Marcus flew back to Germany and they were like, Hey,
[02:04:57] you and so and so get up to, uh, I forgot it was Ramstein, like go meet him.
[02:05:03] Like he's fucked right now.
[02:05:05] So we, we, we got in a car went up there, met him like once he, I think they, they'd
[02:05:10] cleaned him up once he got out of like the, you know, the, um, the ER or whatever, but
[02:05:16] he was covered in, he was nasty looking.
[02:05:18] I used like, it looked like he, his, the, all the, the wounds he had were just like,
[02:05:24] just healing.
[02:05:25] So like his face was covered in shit.
[02:05:27] All his arms and legs were like covered in like, he looked horrible, but he was like
[02:05:32] super excited to see us because he was, you know, he thought he was going to get his head
[02:05:37] cut off for it.
[02:05:38] I was, uh, I was the admiral's aid and I was just about done with that job.
[02:05:44] So I'd come back from Iraq and I, I became the admiral's aid.
[02:05:46] And so when that was happening, I was tracking what was happening and I remember they're
[02:05:54] like, like they're telling the admiral, Hey, it seems like there's a guy that's alive.
[02:06:02] And I was, like I said, I was a radio man.
[02:06:04] So I was like, bro, they're like, they have, they have his radio.
[02:06:08] Like this is in my, I didn't say this verbally, but I was thinking to myself, man, they have
[02:06:12] his radio and they've turned his radio on and they turned on the transponder or whatever.
[02:06:16] You know, how is a guy alive right now?
[02:06:18] It didn't make any sense.
[02:06:20] And then by the next day it was like, no, they have actually have comms.
[02:06:23] And I remember thinking, this is a freaking miracle.
[02:06:26] Um, how this, if this guy's alive for real.
[02:06:30] And the weird thing was I, I had met the Latrell boys at a West coast reunion.
[02:06:39] And I just saw them, but I remember because they were big giant monster guys and they're
[02:06:44] twins, right?
[02:06:45] Which is, they just stand out corn fed Texas, Texas.
[02:06:48] And I remember like seeing them and being like, damn, that's freaking legit.
[02:06:52] You got your twin brother and you're both in the deep.
[02:06:55] It's like, how cool is that?
[02:06:56] And then sure enough, as I put the piece together, it's like, Oh shit, it's that guy.
[02:06:59] It's one of those two guys.
[02:07:01] Uh, and man, that was horrible, horrible scenario.
[02:07:08] Um, I remember thinking at that time, A, this is definitely going to be made into a film
[02:07:14] because the story was just unbelievable.
[02:07:17] And B, oh shit, like bad things can happen to team guys.
[02:07:21] Like, you know, you'd heard of like a death or two, a training accident or, you know,
[02:07:25] someone died overseas, but until that helicopter went down, I sort of thought team guys were
[02:07:30] invincible.
[02:07:32] And for the first time, I remember thinking like, Oh shit.
[02:07:36] Um, this might not end well.
[02:07:40] And you know, you see someone of your girlfriends suddenly become widows and got real, really
[02:07:46] quick.
[02:07:47] So what'd you do when you got home from that deployment?
[02:07:51] We had a huge party.
[02:07:53] We had a big party, invited everybody, including the CEO.
[02:07:57] And I think, um, to this day, we still talk about that.
[02:08:00] Amber bought me a Keggerator.
[02:08:01] She was kind of celebrating us coming back.
[02:08:03] And you know, a few people were not happy at that because of that, you know, because
[02:08:07] of the healer coming down and guys didn't come home.
[02:08:09] And I think those were all our like brothers and friends and sisters.
[02:08:14] And, uh, we, you know, Amber's thought was, Hey, I just want to celebrate like that guys
[02:08:19] came back, you know, and so we threw a party and she bought me a Keggerator.
[02:08:23] I think from Costco.
[02:08:25] And that was really cool because I had just all of a sudden I gained like a hundred friends
[02:08:27] overnight.
[02:08:28] Like guys would just stop by and be like, Hey, I'm just grabbing a beer.
[02:08:31] How do you Keggerator?
[02:08:33] Um, but I think that night Amber had the CEO's stop.
[02:08:37] Don't even say it.
[02:08:38] No, it's great.
[02:08:39] She had the, she had the CEO's wife doing a Keggerator, but I had her like legs up
[02:08:43] in the air.
[02:08:44] She got thrown into that and in her defense.
[02:08:46] It was great, but it's still a good story.
[02:08:49] I think it was E five at the time.
[02:08:50] She's great.
[02:08:51] And he's great.
[02:08:52] They're amazing.
[02:08:53] Uh, what about career?
[02:08:55] What do you, what are you doing now?
[02:08:56] What's your next move from there?
[02:08:58] Yeah.
[02:08:59] So, uh, come back for my second deployment.
[02:09:01] Uh, I'd already screened for after my first and they just said, Hey, uh, we're not taking
[02:09:07] anybody after one platoon.
[02:09:10] So good, you know, you're good.
[02:09:11] Go, go do one deployment and come back and you'll be in that next class.
[02:09:15] I was in 06 and, and you're rolling to that selection.
[02:09:19] How was that?
[02:09:20] It was good.
[02:09:21] Um, again, just full focus.
[02:09:23] Um, you know, I, you know, to my surprise guys didn't practice, but like, I just wanted
[02:09:29] to be there.
[02:09:30] Like I wanted to be just, you know, when I found out about that place, I was like, yeah,
[02:09:34] that's exactly what I want to do.
[02:09:35] So I trained and worked hard and, um, yeah, I just had a good CQC block and like I was
[02:09:42] saying, you know, like, like was one of the, I was the top like pistol shooter and with
[02:09:47] the right, that's where I was like struggling with the rifle.
[02:09:49] And I went from like, they post your scores every day, your time, there's no hiding.
[02:09:53] Like, like when you shoot, like you show up and you're like, Oh, Marcus 57 out of 60,
[02:09:57] like what?
[02:09:58] And it was like, Oh, look at shit bag.
[02:10:00] Like, if you don't move up, you're out of here.
[02:10:03] Right.
[02:10:04] And so, um, I wasn't like in the pistol, pistol was at the top, but the rifle, the initial
[02:10:08] week I was really close to the bottom.
[02:10:10] And I'm like, dude, this is not like, I can't, that's so weird.
[02:10:14] I can't, it was weird.
[02:10:15] And then it's good at pistol and not good at rifles.
[02:10:18] Just weird.
[02:10:19] And was there something that didn't click in your head and then some, something finally
[02:10:22] made a click?
[02:10:23] Jaco, I'm still trying to figure out what's fucking in my head.
[02:10:28] I don't know.
[02:10:29] I, I, man, I wish I could, I could say, but I managed to crawl my way back into the top
[02:10:35] 10 just by like sheer, you know, have to as you would respect that.
[02:10:42] Like I just had to get, I had to get good and I got, I got a lot better.
[02:10:47] So, but no, I, I did really well.
[02:10:50] Um, I finished that and kind of finished green team and, and, you know, they kind of do a
[02:10:55] ranking and, um, you know, you're not supposed to know, but I was, I guess I was chosen first.
[02:10:59] Um, and I went over to squadron, hung out with our, got to work for our bro that I talked
[02:11:05] about earlier.
[02:11:06] I don't know if you care if we say his name on here or what, but I say, don't say his name.
[02:11:10] Okay.
[02:11:11] Yeah.
[02:11:12] Um, but yeah, it was, uh, everything, everything that I thought.
[02:11:17] Uh, probably actually more and, and a lot of stuff that I didn't expect, um, for sure.
[02:11:23] And probably Amber will tell you, like life just got weird or after that.
[02:11:29] So now you start knocking out deployments.
[02:11:31] Um, what's the cycle that you run every year?
[02:11:34] So we were deploying every year.
[02:11:35] Sometimes twice now, but at the time it was six on and then three, six on.
[02:11:41] It was three.
[02:11:42] Yeah.
[02:11:43] Three month deployment, six, six back.
[02:11:45] Yeah.
[02:11:46] Three training, three on standby, three gone, three training.
[02:11:51] And then on standby, you know, flyways.
[02:11:53] Um, and, um, it was good again, but I was away way more than even, um, and even at the
[02:12:02] teams where your deployments to, um, all side, um, you know, Bagram, um, so both Iraq and
[02:12:12] Afghanistan, both OEF, OF, yep.
[02:12:14] And you're bouncing back and what, what's your, um, what's your job?
[02:12:18] Uh, I was also preacher there.
[02:12:21] Um, yeah.
[02:12:22] I mean, that's, that's exactly, that's all I did.
[02:12:25] Um, I loved it.
[02:12:27] And I was, um, I did a lot of the combatives.
[02:12:29] So it was that split at the time where it was like sport fighters and combatives and
[02:12:35] combative guys hate sport fighters and sport fighters think combative guys are gay.
[02:12:38] And you know, it was like that thing going on, you know, and I thought it was funny,
[02:12:43] but I do tell this story, um, because I trained every morning I went in, we had, um, you know,
[02:12:49] Kuchy had his guys every day.
[02:12:51] And so I'd go in for two hours and train.
[02:12:52] I never trained at, at, at a gym just because we have to work.
[02:12:57] I went home.
[02:12:58] Um, but I did train every day.
[02:13:00] And there was one day I was, um, I had a guy in a full mount and I was trying to figure
[02:13:04] out a way to, to put a, like a, like a collar, like some kind of choke with it.
[02:13:08] You know, and I was trying to grab his collar and then it like stopped.
[02:13:12] And I looked at him and I'm like, what the fuck are we doing?
[02:13:14] Why am I trying to choke you?
[02:13:15] Why aren't I like, why don't I like hitting you, put my knee on your chest, like get up
[02:13:20] and go to my sidearm or pull out something and stick you with it or just like push you
[02:13:23] and get away.
[02:13:24] And from there I was like, you know, I'm not doing any more sport fighting.
[02:13:27] I just like, I just want to know how to like just like pound, pound, pound or, you know,
[02:13:32] gouge your eye out or just like stick you in the gut with a knife and just get the fuck
[02:13:36] out of here.
[02:13:37] And, and then like I started more of moving into the camp of like the combative side of
[02:13:42] the house.
[02:13:43] And then of course you had people saying, well, no, if you're a better sport fighter
[02:13:45] that a transition is like the skydivers.
[02:13:47] Like if you skydive slick forever, no, I could, any of those guys could strap on a heavy
[02:13:53] rock and you know, so it was just anyway, it was back and forth and I digress with,
[02:13:59] where are we going on that one?
[02:14:03] I loved all of it.
[02:14:04] How about that?
[02:14:05] It was, you know, I, um, but so okay.
[02:14:06] But you asked me what I was doing.
[02:14:08] I was a breacher and I did, you know, I did a lot of commons stuff.
[02:14:10] And I climbed and, and Amber, what's, what's life like for you now?
[02:14:15] Now he's gone even more.
[02:14:17] I was way more settled.
[02:14:19] So that's actually when I met, around that time is when I met Sarah Wilkinson.
[02:14:23] And our life was very centered around the command and, you know, other command members,
[02:14:30] command families, we all sort of, you know, worked out together, hung out together, weekends
[02:14:35] together, um, with the kids, sports and pool parties and birthdays.
[02:14:40] And, you know, it was, it was, um, very tight knit.
[02:14:45] And one of the, one of the things that I remember so much about when Sarah was talking through,
[02:14:52] you know, her experience with Chad was like, it left such an impression on me.
[02:14:59] She's just talking about like this personality change that she saw from him over time.
[02:15:09] And you know, it, were you seeing that kind of thing from Marcus at this point?
[02:15:15] Were you seeing, was he getting withdrawn?
[02:15:17] Was he, you know, short fused?
[02:15:20] Was he, it's, you know, it sounded like what, what Chad was doing was more like the withdrawn
[02:15:24] thing.
[02:15:25] And you know, she was like, look, he wasn't like the most talkative guy in the world.
[02:15:27] But all of a sudden like she noticed that he was different.
[02:15:32] Yeah.
[02:15:33] And then before you can go, like, and so I worked with Chad, he was one of my recce
[02:15:36] guys and I never, like he was smiling, happy, joking.
[02:15:41] And again, this is right when he, he showed up there.
[02:15:44] Yeah.
[02:15:45] It's 2008.
[02:15:46] So he was still like just back from being out in the private sector for a number of years.
[02:15:52] So like he was, I feel like he was still like giddy and just, Hey, life is, life is chill.
[02:15:58] It's good.
[02:15:59] It's, you know, nothing's really taking me down.
[02:16:01] At least that's how I remember him.
[02:16:03] If, you know, we go back to the examples that I already gave of Marcus with, you know, our
[02:16:07] son crawling all over him and showing up with the picked geraniums.
[02:16:11] Like he was still very much into being a husband and a dad.
[02:16:15] And even in his first and second platoons, you know, with Maggie's birth, he was there
[02:16:22] where work came first, but he was there.
[02:16:25] What we transitioned into was living completely separate lives.
[02:16:31] And so he would come home and he would say things like, Hey, where are your cups?
[02:16:36] You know, in his own home that he was paying for.
[02:16:40] And we would get everything looking perfect because he would be home for five days, which
[02:16:45] you know, it was pretty typical between trips.
[02:16:49] Living more than that was a pretty long time, but he had, we had become distant and I had
[02:16:57] become, you know, way more rooted in my friends and my life and my kids.
[02:17:01] And it was okay that we live separate lives because the ladies that I was around and their
[02:17:08] children were living that same life.
[02:17:10] And so there was this shared respect and sacrifice that no one else understood, but the people
[02:17:17] in your inner circle knew without having to even talk about.
[02:17:21] And so as he was becoming more and more distant, I guess you just sort of chalk it up to that's
[02:17:30] how things are now.
[02:17:32] And do you actually notice it or is it like the proverbial like boiling of a frog where
[02:17:39] it's just like the frog doesn't know that the water is getting hot until it's all of
[02:17:43] a sudden it's dead.
[02:17:44] It's too slow.
[02:17:45] Is it like that kind of thing where?
[02:17:47] I think so.
[02:17:48] You're just going through it and it's like, oh, yeah, he's going on another trip and oh,
[02:17:50] it's another trip and he's back, but he's, you know, going to sleep or I don't want to
[02:17:55] bother him that type of thing over time.
[02:17:57] Yeah, like we could play nice for those five day spans where the house looked perfect and
[02:18:02] the kids behaved perfect and he was as present as he could be.
[02:18:08] But it became a lot more comfortable to live separately.
[02:18:14] And you know, it was all in the name of the United States of America.
[02:18:19] It was all for the greater good.
[02:18:20] And it felt like when he would come home, he would certainly be more checked out.
[02:18:26] Like he couldn't wait to leave again.
[02:18:28] Like I could sense that and family time felt like forced time, especially at the command.
[02:18:35] So it was getting really hard.
[02:18:38] He was getting certainly pulling away more drinking more.
[02:18:42] He felt like a stranger.
[02:18:46] How much are you drinking at this point?
[02:18:51] Normal amounts.
[02:18:52] By team standards.
[02:18:55] By our standards, by the Bros standards.
[02:18:58] Yeah, I think we just, man, we just went around a rabbit hole.
[02:19:05] I mean, we, I think I was just drinking a lot of bourbon often.
[02:19:13] But I never really knew that because I wasn't with him that much.
[02:19:16] Yeah, but even when I came home, like it was.
[02:19:19] I didn't know like what his drinking habits were because we were really never together.
[02:19:24] I mean, the last couple of years that you were deploying, he was gone for almost 300
[02:19:30] days a year.
[02:19:31] Like, you know.
[02:19:32] But I think it's pretty toxic.
[02:19:33] I mean, we're all, everyone's doing the same thing.
[02:19:35] Everyone's drinking hard.
[02:19:37] Everyone's, I think, going through the same things.
[02:19:39] Some are affected probably more than others.
[02:19:41] And I didn't say anything wrong.
[02:19:45] You didn't say anything wrong.
[02:19:46] I mean.
[02:19:47] At what point did you, at what point did you start to see something wrong?
[02:19:50] 2008.
[02:19:51] Yeah, I think 2008.
[02:19:52] Josh.
[02:19:53] Yeah, Josh, one of my close best friends from Bud's and then through the teams passed
[02:19:59] on a op.
[02:20:01] And that was just unexpected.
[02:20:04] And that was like a River and Stream crossing, right?
[02:20:07] Yeah.
[02:20:08] And it was just, it was tough because I was, I was supposed to do that River and Stream
[02:20:12] crossing.
[02:20:15] And we, when, when he got swept down the river, we, I think we looked for him for almost,
[02:20:23] it's like 10 to 12 hours.
[02:20:27] And then he washed up 50 clicks down.
[02:20:29] And then he got a cone hour, which was like a class four rabbit.
[02:20:33] It was, it was nasty.
[02:20:34] It was gnarly.
[02:20:35] So just, you know, seeing him kind of get, get pulled out of the water is like really,
[02:20:41] it's not, not good.
[02:20:45] Not good.
[02:20:46] And myself and another individual took his body back to his, his family in North Carolina.
[02:20:54] And we stayed there a week.
[02:20:56] And then we were there is when Jason Dusty got killed like a couple of days later on
[02:21:02] an op to direct fire.
[02:21:05] Both of them got shot.
[02:21:08] And of course we were supposed to be on that op.
[02:21:10] And it was just, you know, it was just, you know, you went through it, Jaco.
[02:21:14] And it was just one of those times that was, it was, you know, I tried to look at it as
[02:21:20] like, though, this is what it's supposed to be.
[02:21:22] Like this is just the way it happens.
[02:21:24] I became numb after a while.
[02:21:26] You know, even when extortion went down, I remember talking to Scott Moore, I'm a more
[02:21:31] about it.
[02:21:32] I was like, Admiral, I'm fucking numb to this.
[02:21:34] Like this doesn't affect me anymore.
[02:21:35] Like I don't just, I don't get it.
[02:21:37] Like, why is this still happening?
[02:21:39] And it was just, it was just the conversation we were having, I think, through these years,
[02:21:43] we're just getting just odd.
[02:21:47] And I think I remember seeing this, the psych for the first time in, in 08 at the command,
[02:21:51] just like asking him, like, what's, what's going on?
[02:21:55] Can you, you know, help me out a little bit or whatever?
[02:21:58] And that was like the first time I ever actually went and spoke to somebody, but we didn't
[02:22:03] talk about it.
[02:22:04] Like nobody talked about it, maybe.
[02:22:06] But he also has, we have his medical record and I was just looking through it and it says,
[02:22:11] like, you know, decided not to talk to the command psych for fear of not being able to
[02:22:16] deploy, which is the, you need to hear all the time.
[02:22:20] I don't, I don't remember, I don't remember that.
[02:22:23] Yeah.
[02:22:24] So I was certainly noticing that he, it just, it seemed like he was just like a renegade
[02:22:27] to me.
[02:22:28] He did not care.
[02:22:29] He did not care.
[02:22:30] And those deployments were so insane.
[02:22:32] It's like, someone was dying every deployment.
[02:22:34] And so it felt like Russia and roulette.
[02:22:37] And I just, between Josh in 2008 and then there were, you know, other deaths that weren't
[02:22:44] so close to us.
[02:22:45] And Adam Brown dying in 2010, who were very, very close with Adam and his family and our
[02:22:51] kids best friends at the time.
[02:22:54] I was just like, this is nuts.
[02:22:56] We can't do this anymore.
[02:22:58] Yeah.
[02:22:59] And so it got, got to a point where I just felt like I had to do something different.
[02:23:02] I wasn't like fully, fully checked in.
[02:23:05] And again, talking to the admiral, he's like, you should go to OCS.
[02:23:09] He's like, you should be an officer.
[02:23:10] I'm like, I just, I need a break right now.
[02:23:13] Bad.
[02:23:14] He's like, now I just go to OCS.
[02:23:15] You're going to be a good officer.
[02:23:17] And so I went to OCS for like two days.
[02:23:21] Oh yeah.
[02:23:23] Yeah.
[02:23:24] Didn't you have to put like a package?
[02:23:25] Oh yeah.
[02:23:26] I did fucking all this shit.
[02:23:27] I did.
[02:23:28] You kind of.
[02:23:29] He even passed up being promoted to chief so someone else could have it because he thought
[02:23:33] he was going to.
[02:23:34] I did.
[02:23:35] I went in and, I went in and talked to the, yeah, the CMC at the time said, don't make
[02:23:39] me a chief.
[02:23:40] I said, make so-and-so a chief because I'm, you know, I'm going to go to OCS.
[02:23:44] Like, why would you make me a chief and I'm like, you're going to take it away from somebody.
[02:23:47] So they didn't, they made him chief and I went to OCS.
[02:23:52] So you knew what you were getting into with this?
[02:23:55] No.
[02:23:56] Obviously I did.
[02:23:57] Because.
[02:23:58] No, I didn't.
[02:23:59] I didn't.
[02:24:00] Honestly, like I didn't.
[02:24:01] I was not, I wasn't thinking clearly.
[02:24:03] Let me ask you this.
[02:24:04] When you went and talked to the psychologist.
[02:24:07] Yeah.
[02:24:08] What do you say, what do they say?
[02:24:11] They have like a, you know, they have their standard list of like SOP, you know, like
[02:24:17] what's, how's your home life?
[02:24:18] You know, how is your family?
[02:24:20] You're like, oh, my wife is great.
[02:24:22] My kids are great.
[02:24:23] It's fine.
[02:24:24] Like, are you drinking?
[02:24:25] Yeah.
[02:24:26] Yeah.
[02:24:27] A little bit.
[02:24:28] But you know, normally what, you know, what the guys are doing, nothing, you know, like
[02:24:30] it's, it's very vanilla, right?
[02:24:33] It's very templated.
[02:24:34] And I think, you know, obviously we'll talk about the route that I went eventually when
[02:24:38] I separated, but I think that's the problem is like, you go to school and they try to
[02:24:46] solve a problem in this box that they're taught, but everybody's different.
[02:24:49] Like you're different than me and I'm different from her.
[02:24:53] Like they can't use a standardized template to, I think.
[02:24:57] It's also like a check in the box.
[02:24:58] Like, you know, it's actually called the 30 minute checkup from the neck up.
[02:25:03] Right.
[02:25:04] Oh, is it?
[02:25:05] Oh, wait.
[02:25:06] Is this like a, like they say, Hey, did you get ordered to go do this?
[02:25:08] This is a start part of the standard operating procedure.
[02:25:10] Okay.
[02:25:11] You're back from three deployments.
[02:25:12] You got to go check in with the site.
[02:25:13] Is that what I don't think you give the answers, you know, that you think we'll probably get
[02:25:18] them off your back.
[02:25:19] Yeah.
[02:25:20] Let me, let me figure out what I have to say.
[02:25:21] Yeah.
[02:25:22] So they're not life is fine.
[02:25:23] Kids are great.
[02:25:24] I'm ready to deploy.
[02:25:25] Yeah.
[02:25:26] I'm good.
[02:25:27] And so is that what you did?
[02:25:28] And you go in there because you said you were a little, you were starting to feel it
[02:25:30] a little bit.
[02:25:31] Did you expose that at all when you talked to this, this doctor or not really?
[02:25:35] I don't think so, I don't even remember.
[02:25:38] I'm not sure.
[02:25:39] I just remember him telling me, Marcus, you guys aren't crazy.
[02:25:43] He's like, but your wives, he's like, they're freaking nuts.
[02:25:45] Well, it is crazy.
[02:25:46] I mean, like I literally, like of all the conversations, that's what I remember.
[02:25:50] He's like, Marcus, I don't think you guys are crazy.
[02:25:51] He's like, but I do think your wives are crazy.
[02:25:54] I'm like, whatever you say, I'm on board.
[02:25:57] So that's kind of crazy that you went in there.
[02:25:59] You're feeling like something's not right, but you still get like an up check to go to
[02:26:04] OCS, by the way.
[02:26:05] It was, the reason I went to OCS is because I believed in, in the Admiral.
[02:26:12] I believe in my skipper.
[02:26:13] Like that's the only thing I got.
[02:26:14] I don't want to let him down at all.
[02:26:16] And he's all fired up.
[02:26:17] So fired up.
[02:26:18] He's all fired up.
[02:26:19] He's like, hell yeah.
[02:26:20] So he's fired up.
[02:26:21] I love him.
[02:26:22] Yeah, for sure.
[02:26:23] And so he tells you, no, you're going to be a great officer who sends you OCS and you're
[02:26:25] like, Roger.
[02:26:26] I'm like, Roger that it made sense on paper.
[02:26:28] For sure.
[02:26:29] But I remember, but I remember telling my close friends like, like, no.
[02:26:34] Like my very close friends was like, like, I can't, I can't do this right now.
[02:26:39] Like I can't, I'm not good.
[02:26:40] He's like, no, bro, you got to go.
[02:26:42] Like you're going to regret this.
[02:26:43] I'm like, no, you don't understand.
[02:26:44] Like I can't, like I'm not good.
[02:26:46] He's like, Marcus, you got to get on that plane.
[02:26:47] What did you mean by not good?
[02:26:49] Like I was just not, I was not into it anymore.
[02:26:52] Like I was not mentally like focused or determined or like driven or like any of it.
[02:27:02] Like I just didn't, didn't want to be there.
[02:27:05] Were you seeing this amber?
[02:27:07] I was, but I was also in a complete tailspin because we just needed to, we needed to change
[02:27:12] the scenery.
[02:27:13] I just needed like a calm in the storm to, to reassess.
[02:27:16] You can like survive in like a tornado, for example, it's much easier to survive than
[02:27:21] it is to like survey the damage.
[02:27:23] I was in complete survival mode.
[02:27:25] And so it seemed like, okay, well, this is something that could get me to the other side
[02:27:30] to survey the damage.
[02:27:31] That's a good metaphor.
[02:27:32] So you're like in the storm shelter, you, there's just mayhem going, you're okay in
[02:27:36] the shelter, but you know, at some point you got to get out of this thing and you got to
[02:27:39] get somewhere safe.
[02:27:40] Yeah.
[02:27:41] Yeah.
[02:27:42] And then once the storm is over, like, you know, you think about like any natural disaster
[02:27:45] we lived in on the East coast, hurricanes, like preparing and surviving the hurricane
[02:27:51] isn't the hard part.
[02:27:52] The hard part is cleaning up all the mess on the other side.
[02:27:56] And so I knew we needed to get to a place where we could start cleaning up the mess,
[02:27:59] but you just, you're in such survival mode that you don't even know what that looks like.
[02:28:03] And so for me, OCS sort of like checked that box.
[02:28:06] It was a different change of scenery.
[02:28:09] And in my mind, Marcus always needed a goal.
[02:28:13] His goal was to get a scholarship to become a seal, to get to the command.
[02:28:16] This was just the natural next goal.
[02:28:19] I didn't know that he was so depleted mentally that he didn't have the willpower to care
[02:28:26] about the goal.
[02:28:27] And it was the first time that I had ever seen him not care about a goal.
[02:28:32] That's what I was going to ask you, because you're describing a mess, right?
[02:28:35] But at the same time, you're both also kind of like, you know, the kids are doing good.
[02:28:39] You're doing good.
[02:28:40] We're doing everything.
[02:28:41] No, we're doing everything.
[02:28:42] So was there some like under the reason I'm asking you this question or this line of
[02:28:46] questioning is because if someone is a wife and they're looking at their husband, what
[02:28:52] are they looking for?
[02:28:53] And how do they go?
[02:28:54] Oh, you know what?
[02:28:55] I see.
[02:28:56] I know what this is.
[02:28:57] I understand what's happening.
[02:28:58] There's a loss of motivation.
[02:29:00] Did you see behaviors?
[02:29:02] Was there anything that you said this is not, Marcus is not in a good spot right now?
[02:29:08] Yeah.
[02:29:09] Yeah.
[02:29:10] I mean, there were certain, I just felt like he was reckless.
[02:29:12] I felt like he was a complete renegade.
[02:29:16] He just didn't care.
[02:29:17] And so for me, OCS was a way to dial it back in, give him some direction and focus because
[02:29:23] like, I mean, he didn't cut his hair for nine months.
[02:29:26] He was drinking and then like the RSO the next day, like drinking until four AM, then
[02:29:32] the RSO at eight.
[02:29:33] Like it, to me, it was just sort of like very atypical behavior for him.
[02:29:42] Maybe not necessarily of the teams, but he was so laser focused that the sudden sort
[02:29:47] of renegade attitude was definitely alarming at the same time.
[02:29:51] I never saw him.
[02:29:52] That was probably 10 times worse than I knew OCS today.
[02:29:57] OCS is because I went to OCS and I can't imagine.
[02:30:03] You'd come back from deployment like literally a week or two prior.
[02:30:07] I fucking hate it.
[02:30:08] I showed up and you know, you have all the Marines and yelling and shit and you have
[02:30:13] like a rack like this and they're like, fuck is this guy?
[02:30:17] And I honestly, I'm out of less than a day and a half.
[02:30:19] I remember sitting, first off, I was getting migraines.
[02:30:22] They gave me, they got me ibuprofen six hours after I was fucking hurting.
[02:30:29] And then I remember sitting on the floor, my back was killing me.
[02:30:31] I had all types of like shit going on, my L4 and L5.
[02:30:38] And I'm like trying to read the, was it 11 general orders of the century?
[02:30:42] Like I'm trying to memorize them.
[02:30:46] And I remember taking the book and throwing it across the room and I'm like, hey, who's
[02:30:50] in charge here?
[02:30:51] Like a very nice way.
[02:30:52] Oh, the sentence says like, can I speak to him please?
[02:30:55] Yeah, sure.
[02:30:57] I was like, hey, sir, here's the deal.
[02:30:59] I was like, I just got back from my six combat deployment.
[02:31:01] I was like, I got back a week and a half ago.
[02:31:03] I'm like, and I'm in curse.
[02:31:05] I was like, why are, if I have to go to OCS, like, why are you guys sending me with people
[02:31:10] who like never been here before?
[02:31:12] Like, I don't want to be around any of these people.
[02:31:15] Like, honestly, I was like, I just want to go back to my unit.
[02:31:18] He's like, you know, we usually keep guys here for 12 weeks.
[02:31:21] He's like, you can go tomorrow.
[02:31:22] I'm like, thank you.
[02:31:23] And I did that.
[02:31:24] Dude, that's insane.
[02:31:26] Oh, it was, I was like, what am I doing?
[02:31:28] I'm like, I'm learning how to fold my underwear again.
[02:31:31] Are you kidding me?
[02:31:32] And I remember going back and telling Admiral, I was like, hey, I was like, if you want good
[02:31:36] people to like stay in, you guys got to figure out this OCS thing after guys are going over
[02:31:41] to see us to war for 10 or 15 years.
[02:31:43] Like, come on, like, that's just, you're going to, you're going to get more people like me
[02:31:47] that are like, fuck this.
[02:31:48] Or they hear about what OCS is.
[02:31:51] And instead of going through the whole process of sending their packet in, they're just going
[02:31:54] to hear about it and go, there's no chance.
[02:31:56] Because that's what I've told, I talked to a bunch of people when I got back, they're
[02:31:59] like, oh yeah, you didn't know that?
[02:32:01] They're like, that's why I didn't go.
[02:32:02] I was like, how can you go deal with that for another 12 weeks after all the other shit?
[02:32:07] They're like, so I didn't, they go, but there's this work around.
[02:32:10] And if you, if you become a, it's like, if you go on reserve, you go to like a fork and
[02:32:16] knife school for like four weeks, you get pinned and then you go back on active duty.
[02:32:21] Like they decided to tell me that.
[02:32:22] They figured something out.
[02:32:23] Yeah, they figured something out.
[02:32:24] But he honestly, like he knew, intuitively you knew, you shouldn't have gone.
[02:32:29] That was no chance.
[02:32:30] He called from the airport.
[02:32:31] He called me and he called his best friend.
[02:32:34] And I think I said, like, you've got to listen to your gut.
[02:32:38] And he just ended up pushing through and getting on the plane and going.
[02:32:42] But the day I showed up and like, what am I, I'm not, what am I doing?
[02:32:45] Yeah, that's this is fucking the last place I want to be camp welcome.
[02:32:49] Like so ridiculous.
[02:32:51] Yeah, it was good.
[02:32:52] So they sent you right back to the command.
[02:32:54] Yeah.
[02:32:55] And they usually keep people out process.
[02:32:56] They keep people holding stuff like 12, 12 or 13 weeks at OCS.
[02:33:01] And yeah, they let me go like the next day.
[02:33:03] And what did the, what did like the commands look like the detailer say?
[02:33:07] They were just like, what, you know, what is that's bizarre, dude, like get a bill.
[02:33:12] It's hard to get a bill to OCS.
[02:33:14] I know.
[02:33:15] I did have to apologize to Admiral.
[02:33:16] He's like, Hey, I'm like, I know.
[02:33:18] I was like, I know.
[02:33:22] But he was, I also think he was on the, the committee that that selected you.
[02:33:28] Yeah.
[02:33:29] Well, I'm sure he had a lot of pull whatever his position was.
[02:33:32] Yeah, for sure.
[02:33:33] But in hindsight, it's like, who ever thought that that was a good idea?
[02:33:37] But anyway, but yeah, so I went back and they were like, Hey, what do you need to do?
[02:33:41] I said, I just, you know, there's someone out there right now going, see, OCS is so
[02:33:45] hard.
[02:33:46] So much hard.
[02:33:47] It's got to quit.
[02:33:48] Yeah.
[02:33:49] I quit.
[02:33:50] Yeah.
[02:33:51] So I just told him, I said, Hey, I need, I just need a break.
[02:33:56] It's where, wherever that is.
[02:33:58] I said, I was thinking maybe, maybe go out to the West Coast and just forget about stuff.
[02:34:01] And I'm like, yeah, that's fine.
[02:34:02] Go do it.
[02:34:03] So that's what we did.
[02:34:04] And I just went out to, yeah, went to the center and wanted to teach tactics and they
[02:34:10] threw me in first phase, which is like the worst place they could have put me.
[02:34:14] And it was not good.
[02:34:17] Like I was, and as you know, all the guys are are awesome.
[02:34:21] Like good dudes, all of them been overseas, hard, hard nose dudes, like great workers.
[02:34:30] I didn't want to be around anybody.
[02:34:31] I was like, I don't want to make friends with anybody.
[02:34:33] They probably thought I was like standoffish because like I didn't want to hang out with
[02:34:36] anybody.
[02:34:37] It was just, it was just not a good time.
[02:34:40] I, I body slammed a student in front of the flagpole and like one of the, one of the instructor
[02:34:46] staff grabbed me and he was like, Hey man, so you, like you're going to get a lot of
[02:34:51] trouble if you don't fucking like tone it down.
[02:34:53] Like, I don't know what's going on.
[02:34:55] And so there was just a lot of little things like that that were starting to happen.
[02:34:59] And I just didn't care.
[02:35:00] I was like, you know, fuck everybody, you know, at the time.
[02:35:05] One of my guys, JP to know who's been on this podcast a few times and he was, he was in
[02:35:11] my task unit.
[02:35:12] It was in Ramadi, came back, went to another platoon and then they got from shoulder surgery
[02:35:17] and got pulled out and they sent him to buds.
[02:35:18] And it was like one month deep.
[02:35:20] They called me over at trade at the leg.
[02:35:22] You got to come get your boy.
[02:35:23] It was the same thing.
[02:35:25] He was just not in a good headspace to be putting students through, you know, first
[02:35:32] phase because you just wasn't in the right spot, you know, like had to get him out of
[02:35:36] there and get some frigate.
[02:35:39] He was a loose cannon.
[02:35:45] You're working for, how long are you in first phase for?
[02:35:48] First phase for a year.
[02:35:49] And then finally they kicked me over to the SQT.
[02:35:51] No, no, no, you're sitting here saying like, I don't want to be around anybody.
[02:35:55] I didn't want to make friends with anybody.
[02:35:56] What do you see in Amber?
[02:35:57] Like, what does this look like to you?
[02:35:59] We were talking home with him and we had been a part for the, the bigger part of every year
[02:36:07] leading into this.
[02:36:08] And so it was very, very, very difficult.
[02:36:11] I know.
[02:36:12] I was trying to be optimistic.
[02:36:14] We were super settled in Virginia Beach and so I'm like, Oh, a new beginning.
[02:36:17] I bought cruisers for everyone.
[02:36:19] I thought we would come out to California and suddenly be this happy family.
[02:36:23] And when we got here, everything just completely hit the fan because I didn't have my community
[02:36:29] anymore.
[02:36:30] I mean, started every single morning at Sarah Wilkinson's gym, CrossFit Odyssey at the time.
[02:36:34] It's core group of girls and my kids had their friends.
[02:36:39] We had an amazing neighborhood, a great house and suddenly we're in California.
[02:36:44] We don't know anyone and now Marcus is home and the kids, you know, like our son in particular
[02:36:51] had this sort of idea of who Marcus was in his mind.
[02:36:54] He was sort of like this myth of a dad and, you know, he really didn't know him.
[02:37:01] And I think that whenever we, the dad that he got delivered back was nothing like the
[02:37:07] dad that he had created in his mind at the time.
[02:37:10] And so he started acting out like everything was going bad.
[02:37:14] And I don't know.
[02:37:17] I just...
[02:37:18] It's hard for me to like picture this right now because you seem like a super chill dude,
[02:37:22] like all nice and mellow.
[02:37:25] And like, so what, like, what does this look like at home?
[02:37:28] He had become a monster.
[02:37:29] Well, first of all, he was completely disconnected to us.
[02:37:32] It felt like he didn't want to be anywhere really.
[02:37:35] I mean, I didn't feel like he wanted to be anyplace else.
[02:37:38] I felt like he wanted to be nowhere.
[02:37:39] Like he didn't have a purpose, a belonging of...
[02:37:43] He didn't give a damn about anything.
[02:37:47] He was definitely drinking a lot, a lot more than I had realized or he started drinking
[02:37:53] more than, you know, I was comfortable with.
[02:37:55] And there were certainly times that I was...
[02:38:01] I just thought there's no good way out of this.
[02:38:06] Leaving him is not going to necessarily solve anything.
[02:38:09] Staying with him, I don't know how much worse this can get.
[02:38:13] Yeah.
[02:38:14] But just to go back, Jaco.
[02:38:16] I was still like, I was still functioning.
[02:38:18] Like I was still, you know, engaging with the guys.
[02:38:21] I mean, I had, you know, I had bros and stuff, but I was...
[02:38:25] I didn't want to...
[02:38:27] It wasn't fun for me anymore.
[02:38:29] I didn't want to be one of the guys and, you know, it was just not...
[02:38:34] It just wasn't the same.
[02:38:35] It was just different.
[02:38:38] You know, and thank God I got kicked over to SQT.
[02:38:41] So I ran CQC for about a year and a half and a great staff.
[02:38:44] I mean, those guys, you know, I joke because we had a great self.
[02:38:48] I feel like those guys did everything.
[02:38:49] I'm like, I didn't even need to be there.
[02:38:51] Like literally the LPO from...
[02:38:53] I mean, they just...
[02:38:54] They ran the show.
[02:38:55] And so thank goodness I was just kind of in the background just...
[02:38:58] I think I started school online at USD.
[02:39:01] I did a graduate program there.
[02:39:05] So we would, you know, work the students in SQT and then at night we'd put them to bed
[02:39:08] and then I would stay up and, you know, do work and stuff.
[02:39:11] And so, you know, it wasn't like a complete mess.
[02:39:17] You know, I think everything was like...
[02:39:19] I was functioning.
[02:39:20] It wasn't...
[02:39:21] You know, I don't want to sit here and say like, you know, he was like stuck in the corner
[02:39:26] of his house, sucking on his thumb every day.
[02:39:28] No, no, no, you're still functioning.
[02:39:30] Still going to work, but like you just didn't care.
[02:39:32] Like you didn't...
[02:39:33] I was just checking out everything.
[02:39:34] Marcus doesn't do well without a goal and, you know, something to work towards.
[02:39:38] And so...
[02:39:39] I mean, most of us don't.
[02:39:41] So going back to get his master's degree while he was at SQT was definitely like a check
[02:39:46] in the box.
[02:39:47] And then I think at some point...
[02:39:50] Oh, well, then the bin lawn raid happened, which...
[02:39:54] Well, it kind of lost my mind on that one, just not being there.
[02:39:57] Like you, like put me in the...
[02:40:00] Put me in coach.
[02:40:01] There was like this big sort of like resurgence of let's get back to Virginia Beach and...
[02:40:07] So I did.
[02:40:08] I called up the CMC.
[02:40:09] I was like, hey, I want to come back.
[02:40:10] He's like, done, come back.
[02:40:11] And then I just kind of faded quickly.
[02:40:14] Well, no, it was replaced.
[02:40:15] I mean, that was our plan was to go back and then extortion happened and, you know, so
[02:40:21] many more of our friends died.
[02:40:24] And then it was like, what are we going to go back to, to that same game of Russian roulette?
[02:40:29] You know, we just didn't know each other anymore.
[02:40:32] And it was very uncomfortable to be in the house.
[02:40:35] He was learning how to be around the kids.
[02:40:37] The kids were very uncomfortable.
[02:40:39] Like how does dad fit back into this dynamic?
[02:40:42] And so we thought like at the time, we know dysfunction, we know deployments, we know
[02:40:47] not being together.
[02:40:50] We don't know how to be a normal family.
[02:40:51] I don't know what families do on the weekends.
[02:40:54] I don't know how a family spends a Friday night, but I know how to be a single mom.
[02:40:59] And so rushing back into that dysfunction was the safest thing at the time, which was replaced
[02:41:06] by a big fat reality slap of, oh, extortion just happened.
[02:41:14] We're going to go back to the Russian roulette.
[02:41:15] Do we really want to do that?
[02:41:17] And so that's at that point, he decided, let me just get out of the military altogether.
[02:41:22] No, you missed a whole bunch.
[02:41:24] Oh, my turn.
[02:41:25] You missed, you missed something.
[02:41:27] What?
[02:41:28] Um, that's when I went to speak to OIC from SQT.
[02:41:31] And I was like, Hey, I'm like, I'm not, you know, something not right.
[02:41:36] Like I'm not doing well.
[02:41:37] And he's like, why don't you go speak to the, I don't know, it was a West Coast dive medical
[02:41:40] officer, whatever they call.
[02:41:43] So I went over there and it was a psych and just started telling him about what's going
[02:41:48] on.
[02:41:49] And he said, Marcus, um, he said, first off, you're not, you're definitely not the only
[02:41:54] one that's come in here.
[02:41:55] He's like, matter of fact, he goes, I can't even count the number of guys that have come
[02:41:59] in here now over the last couple months.
[02:42:01] Um, and they have literally given me the same exact story.
[02:42:05] And he goes, I don't know what it is, but he's like, you guys are all experiencing the
[02:42:09] same exact thing.
[02:42:10] And he said, so this is what I'm going to do.
[02:42:13] And I think he's, I think I got prescribed a, you know, a, uh, an SSRI, uh, or SNRI first
[02:42:19] time.
[02:42:20] And I guess that was supposed to stabilize mood.
[02:42:24] And then I got sent to NICO and I came back with like four more medications from the NICO,
[02:42:28] you know, the NICO clinic out in, which I thought was actually a pretty good place,
[02:42:32] but they do a lot of, they do a lot of checking and giving you drugs and they don't do a whole
[02:42:38] lot of, in my opinion, healing.
[02:42:41] When you go and you tell this doctor, something's not right.
[02:42:46] How do you describe something's not right?
[02:42:49] Like what does that sound like?
[02:42:50] Again, I'm looking at this from a perspective of, yeah, how do you help?
[02:42:54] Yeah.
[02:42:55] A first responder, a firefighter, a police officer or somebody in the military that's
[02:42:58] that, what do you track in that they should be paying attention to?
[02:43:03] I think the, one of the biggest is lack of motivation or like lack of purpose.
[02:43:07] You feel like nothing matters anymore at all.
[02:43:12] Like what am I doing this for?
[02:43:14] Like I don't even care.
[02:43:15] And you're like, well, what do you care about?
[02:43:17] Well, I used to like to surf or work out.
[02:43:19] I could give a shit about surfing or working out, or I used to like to go, you know, do
[02:43:24] X, Y and Z.
[02:43:26] I don't even.
[02:43:27] I'm like, here, we'll give you two weeks to do that.
[02:43:29] No, how about I just sit at my house and watch TV and drink bourbon?
[02:43:34] Because I don't have to think about anything and I can numb myself.
[02:43:37] And so I would say to the people out there listening, you're going to start to see that
[02:43:42] you're becoming less motivated to do things of things that you really enjoyed in the past.
[02:43:49] And that's, I think, one of the biggest signs.
[02:43:52] That right there is a telltale sign.
[02:43:54] The stuff you really enjoyed doing when it comes to like a screeching halt, like go talk
[02:43:58] to somebody for sure.
[02:44:01] And I don't know if that's now depression kicking in, or now if you want to call it
[02:44:05] like PTSD or anxiety, or like, you know, now we're getting into the science of it.
[02:44:09] And I don't know also, like, is this a chemical thing?
[02:44:13] Because right now that study that just came out said, it's not a chemical thing.
[02:44:19] So now it's like, OK, well, what's going on in your life that you can't get out of bed
[02:44:23] in the morning?
[02:44:24] Like, you don't want to go to work.
[02:44:25] You don't want to answer your text messages.
[02:44:27] So it's really just like a lack of just like, like if you just like slumped your shoulders
[02:44:31] down and just like not gave a fuck anymore, that's really the...
[02:44:36] There was also a lot of anger, irritability.
[02:44:39] I think those are all things that are part of it.
[02:44:41] So like you become this person that doesn't want to do anything and then you do snap or
[02:44:47] you throw mugs through the window or you choke out the bartender at the country club, you
[02:44:53] know, and stupid shit that...
[02:44:55] All these things have happened by the way.
[02:44:58] That you probably shouldn't be doing.
[02:45:00] There's like a weird, I don't know if that's the wrong word, but when you're living your
[02:45:10] life and everything's like you're saying you got goals, you got things that you want to
[02:45:16] do and you got a long term vision and you got kids and when people die that you know
[02:45:27] that are your friends and then there's this like, there's this thing of like, well, they're
[02:45:39] gone and the world is still going.
[02:45:45] And what is any of this shit mean of, oh, my friend was this awesome guy and now he's
[02:45:55] dead and where I'm still going to morning muster, what is...
[02:46:04] What are we doing here?
[02:46:06] I think that sort of thing, you know, because you start getting like an existential thought
[02:46:13] of this life is the most important thing, but now, oh, you lost a bunch of friends and
[02:46:18] we're still here and we're going on, but we're going to end up where they are and this is
[02:46:22] the way things are going.
[02:46:23] It's like, seems like that could lead to...
[02:46:26] Well, I might as well just watch TV.
[02:46:30] I might as well just sit here and drink bourbon.
[02:46:32] I might as well just do nothing because this is where we're heading.
[02:46:37] This is where we're all heading.
[02:46:39] I don't know, again, this is just like I'm thinking out loud as I'm hearing you describe
[02:46:47] where your headspace was and especially when you're sort of get detached and you get put
[02:46:55] into a different environment where you don't have the same friends and you don't have the
[02:46:59] same like crew of families that you're with.
[02:47:02] And, you know, one thing I can say about losing guys in combat was like, you lose guys in
[02:47:07] combat and you're with all your friends and then you're going to go do more stuff in combat
[02:47:11] and you don't really...
[02:47:13] That feeling of what are we doing here?
[02:47:15] Actually the opposite happens.
[02:47:17] You now know why you're here.
[02:47:18] Like we're going to go and we're going to make things happen.
[02:47:21] We're going to go do our best.
[02:47:22] We're going to stand tall.
[02:47:23] Like you're going to go do all those things so it's sort of the opposite.
[02:47:26] You get juiced up.
[02:47:27] Yeah.
[02:47:28] No, I think you get fired up.
[02:47:29] Like you want to go do that 100% in the environment you're talking about without a doubt.
[02:47:34] I mean, like I said, after that, he went down, like we couldn't even...
[02:47:38] We were screaming, why are we still sitting here?
[02:47:40] Why in the helicopter land right next to us put us on there and send us over there to
[02:47:48] go get redemption?
[02:47:50] And then when you don't have that outlet anymore and then you're looking around and you're
[02:47:55] saying like, well, why am I even going to get out of bed this morning?
[02:48:00] Yeah.
[02:48:01] I think what you're describing, someone told me once and I kind of laugh at it, but it
[02:48:06] makes sense.
[02:48:07] He's like, Marcus, I'm not sure.
[02:48:08] He's like, he's like, definitely, definitely dudes have this PTSD, but he's like, I think
[02:48:12] they have what they call LSD, lack of...
[02:48:16] LSD.
[02:48:17] Yeah, lack of stress disorder.
[02:48:20] He's like, I feel like we have to be in chaos.
[02:48:22] And once that chaos stops is when our shit like unravels.
[02:48:26] And I said, I get that.
[02:48:28] And I said, I feel that they're definitely that's part of it, but there's got to be part
[02:48:33] of something else.
[02:48:34] Like why is everyone and not everyone, but why are there so many experiencing the same
[02:48:38] exact thing?
[02:48:39] You know, I don't never tell you that.
[02:48:41] And I'll still to this day sometimes fight it that, you know, like you, I loved going
[02:48:47] overseas.
[02:48:48] I loved going to war.
[02:48:49] I think that stuff is great.
[02:48:50] And I think it makes you grow.
[02:48:53] Like it makes you better.
[02:48:57] You know, maybe it was some stuff that happened younger, then maybe some wartime stuff, then
[02:49:02] maybe some transition stuff, like you said, like where I wasn't around some people, and
[02:49:06] then maybe some of the family stuff that wasn't working.
[02:49:09] And then maybe the concoction of all these fucking medications that they put me on and
[02:49:13] say, you're going to get better if you take this.
[02:49:14] And I'm going to believe you because you're a doctor.
[02:49:16] You're telling me this is going to be good.
[02:49:19] You know, then you get out and then you're in the private sector, then you don't have
[02:49:21] any of that at all.
[02:49:25] So maybe just all that together is a recipe for it's a perfect storm.
[02:49:29] We found ourselves right in the middle of a perfect storm.
[02:49:32] I have never taken any like drugs or anything.
[02:49:37] Don't.
[02:49:38] Yeah.
[02:49:39] Like so, so even when I hear that and I, but I've, I've, you know, there's been a bunch
[02:49:44] of data and information about them, what they're like and what they do.
[02:49:49] And, you know, people, you get on all these, what are they called psychosomatic drugs?
[02:49:54] Is that what they are?
[02:49:55] They're, I mean, there's a, yeah, there's a bunch of them.
[02:49:58] Some are supposed to like help you release some serotonin.
[02:50:01] So you're like happier and others are supposed to like stabilize your mood, you know, but
[02:50:06] then the problem is once you start taking those, then I don't know, all of a sudden you're
[02:50:10] feeling a little tired or you can't focus.
[02:50:12] So now they give you some provigil, a new vigil so you can focus.
[02:50:15] But now those medicines are causing migraines.
[02:50:17] And I'm like, yeah, I can't sleep now.
[02:50:20] So like, oh, here you ever heard of Ambien?
[02:50:21] And I'm like, yeah, it was on him for six years while I was deploying, but no, you need
[02:50:26] this or maybe we won't give you Ambien.
[02:50:27] We'll give you the other one that's not as like, it's just a, as a constant cycle.
[02:50:33] He did, he was on no prescriptions until the year that he was getting out of the Navy.
[02:50:37] And like between that time and, you know, a couple of years after, he had 10 prescriptions.
[02:50:44] He's on zero today.
[02:50:45] And Amber, I got prescribed my first at, at NICO.
[02:50:49] I know that's the year.
[02:50:50] No, no, from the, from the, from the site.
[02:50:51] And then from NICO, they prescribed me four medications because I was just looking at my
[02:50:55] medical record.
[02:50:56] It's crazy.
[02:50:57] It's crazy.
[02:50:58] And then once we went into all this, I think it was on seven and we get on average, you
[02:51:01] know, what we're doing on the nonprofit.
[02:51:03] The average is seven to eight medications at one time.
[02:51:07] We have people coming to us.
[02:51:08] These are team guys over 20 medications that they're on.
[02:51:11] Not that they're like, Hey, I want to be on this, that they're being prescribed.
[02:51:14] Say, here you're a fucked up.
[02:51:16] Like you should take these.
[02:51:17] Like who prescribed somebody over 20 medications?
[02:51:20] That's like, he seems completely insane.
[02:51:21] Insane to me.
[02:51:22] It's insane.
[02:51:23] And you know, no, look, I have friends that are psychologists and they've explained to
[02:51:28] me that there's like certain things.
[02:51:29] Like there's certain times that certain people need certain things and like it really helps
[02:51:32] them.
[02:51:34] But um, damn, like seven prescriptions for some stuff that makes you stay awake and
[02:51:40] focused and then give you something else that's going to make you sleep.
[02:51:44] I'm not a rocket scientist or a psychologist, my damn self, but that doesn't seem like a
[02:51:48] great thing.
[02:51:49] Yeah.
[02:51:50] Probably.
[02:51:51] It's the go to.
[02:51:52] It's the number one tool in the toolbox, at least if you are being treated by military
[02:51:56] medicine or the VA, if you can't write a prescription for it or talk to a therapist about it, they
[02:52:03] got nothing for you.
[02:52:04] I think the best research I came out recently is that they said, uh, if you get your heart
[02:52:08] rate up, go for a run, go on the mat.
[02:52:12] The actual research is showing that that's better than this.
[02:52:15] These antidepressants that they've been getting us for 35 years.
[02:52:18] And that's why I think now these antidepressants are like, there's a lot of bad shit coming
[02:52:21] out about them.
[02:52:22] Like there's no, like every press you read about them now is, is not good.
[02:52:26] So I think they're slowly going away.
[02:52:28] Yeah.
[02:52:29] Well, I never stopped working out and never stopped training Jiu-Jitsu.
[02:52:34] Like maybe that's, maybe that's it, dude.
[02:52:36] I don't know.
[02:52:37] Probably the best thing, at least I understand you can do, but I still think not for everybody,
[02:52:42] right?
[02:52:43] So I still think there's certain individuals that probably need something.
[02:52:46] Yeah.
[02:52:47] And you know, when they just came out and said, Hey, going for a run, getting your heart
[02:52:51] rate up is better than these, like we should, we should take, we should take that on board.
[02:52:56] Cause like most of America is sitting in front of the computer for 12 hours a day.
[02:52:59] They're wondering why, you know, they're angry or they're depressed, you know, just a little
[02:53:04] bit of, uh, you know, heart rate, heart rate increase activity.
[02:53:09] You help that out.
[02:53:10] And you throw booze into the mix, right?
[02:53:12] Cause like how good is that for you?
[02:53:15] It got seven meds, nine meds, 12 meds, and you're drinking like, and not working out
[02:53:21] as much.
[02:53:24] So you, you decide that you're going to get out.
[02:53:29] And how many years did you have?
[02:53:30] And at this point, 12, 12, and you decide, all right, I'm going to go do something else.
[02:53:35] I'm like, I just want to run away at that point.
[02:53:37] I literally just wanted to run.
[02:53:40] Yeah.
[02:53:43] And what do you think in Amber?
[02:53:45] Well, I should have learned from OCS that big dramatic changes are probably not the
[02:53:51] best, but at the time I thought, I don't want to go back to the Russian roulette.
[02:53:58] And I know Marcus needs a goal and he probably feels like, you know, leaving the command
[02:54:03] and becoming an instructor is going, you know, not necessarily going in a goal oriented direction.
[02:54:09] So maybe having a career is the next best goal he just graduated.
[02:54:13] He had, he got his master's degree and I went with it.
[02:54:20] Dude, only a freaking team guy could be going like on all these drugs and drinking and still
[02:54:23] get their master's degree.
[02:54:25] That's so retarded.
[02:54:27] It's like, that's so ridiculous.
[02:54:28] I saw people, I was the best when I wasn't thinking.
[02:54:31] Like if I could just go, if you could just wind me up and go, I'm fine.
[02:54:34] But as soon as I stopped for half a second is when the chicken's tumbling down.
[02:54:39] So little did I know that I was actually like stepping into like the, you know, perfect,
[02:54:47] perfect storm.
[02:54:48] We were living in a pretty bad one, but the perfect storm was childhood trauma, war trauma,
[02:54:55] head trauma, transition trauma, family trauma, loss of purpose, loss of paycheck, loss of
[02:55:01] community, loss of identity.
[02:55:05] And he wanted to get so far away from the military and the teams that he went into
[02:55:11] banking.
[02:55:12] What was, what was pushing you away from the freaking teams?
[02:55:16] I, no idea.
[02:55:19] No clue.
[02:55:20] If I had to guess.
[02:55:21] Anger, just anger, like anger at, and probably wasn't the teams.
[02:55:23] It was just anger of like everything.
[02:55:26] Because you know what it's like when you like see one of your team guy friends that you
[02:55:31] haven't seen in a while and you're just super stoked.
[02:55:34] Like I remember I got back from my last balloon was we're going to trade at dude.
[02:55:37] I worked at trade at, you know, so there's different team guys come every day was like
[02:55:40] a reunion every day.
[02:55:41] Like, yeah, just like, oh, hey, we go, what's your, like every day was like that.
[02:55:46] I mean, my freaking kids will say to me, my oldest daughter right now, she'll say to me,
[02:55:51] like, why don't you just go back in?
[02:55:53] I'm always like, well, I can't really go back in.
[02:55:56] I'm like an old guy now.
[02:55:58] Why don't you just go back in?
[02:56:00] So what was that just not there anymore?
[02:56:03] Were you feeling like, you know, you see your friends and you're like, I don't.
[02:56:07] Yeah, I don't care.
[02:56:08] I don't care.
[02:56:09] Yeah, it was just, you know, Jacque was just like a.
[02:56:14] I don't know how to describe it was completely numb inside.
[02:56:18] He feels like that now.
[02:56:19] That's what I'm saying.
[02:56:20] It was a period of time when the healer went down.
[02:56:22] Like I had this weird conversation with the Admiral was just like, I'm numb.
[02:56:26] This is not even affecting me anymore.
[02:56:28] Like I don't get it.
[02:56:29] He's like, yeah, but this hurts.
[02:56:30] I'm like, yeah, it hurts, but I'm, I just don't, it's not even registering.
[02:56:35] It's just.
[02:56:36] So this is, this is when we see like there's something like to me now, like, okay, there's
[02:56:40] something, there's something wrong.
[02:56:42] There's something going on in here.
[02:56:43] Like for a team guy to, to not like be kind of stoked to see their friends.
[02:56:51] Like I just remember my whole life.
[02:56:53] I would go to work and just be stoked.
[02:56:55] Like there's never a day where I was like, I'm bummed out to go to work today.
[02:56:58] Every day was just awesome and fun and going to see my friends and we're going to hang
[02:57:04] out and we're going to shoot some shit.
[02:57:05] And like, thank God I always had that feeling, you know, I always had that feeling.
[02:57:11] So this is what tells me like, again, going back to Chad and hearing Sarah describe this
[02:57:17] change in his personality, you know, and that's where I, the only thing that I could imagine
[02:57:26] that could cause.
[02:57:27] Like, like it has to be something else that's causing you to get in this mode of, you know,
[02:57:34] oh, there's freaking four guys that I haven't seen in five years and I went to Bud's with
[02:57:40] them or I was at a platoon with them or whatever.
[02:57:42] I think you would, someone would have been like that though.
[02:57:44] Yeah, but I also used to want to run high too.
[02:57:46] Remember that?
[02:57:47] Like I never wanted to go back to Virginia Beach.
[02:57:49] Oh, well, that's true.
[02:57:50] I didn't want to see anybody.
[02:57:52] But also like, you know, he sort of had, he was at this pinnacle of what he wanted for
[02:58:00] his career and the teams.
[02:58:02] And so to leave that and go to a new place was hard, you know, it would be like transferring
[02:58:08] coasts for anybody when you're making all new friends or being out here.
[02:58:13] The vibe, I mean, obviously we love it here.
[02:58:16] We're here now.
[02:58:18] But the vibe here versus the East Coast was very different and that people are a lot more
[02:58:22] spread out here.
[02:58:23] So we were by ourselves in a neighborhood far away from other military families.
[02:58:29] And we just didn't feel like people really got it.
[02:58:33] And so I think that he got to this place of being so numb and not really caring after
[02:58:40] the transition.
[02:58:41] But it was very hard to go back to Virginia Beach.
[02:58:44] But I hear you now because like we live in Coronado and I love it because I get to see
[02:58:48] my bros, like guys that are contractors, they come in like, Hey, what's going on?
[02:58:52] You know, so it's good.
[02:58:54] Now it's, but now it's different.
[02:58:55] I mean, I'd say different places.
[02:58:56] I guess the thing that I'm trying to say is like you can, it's like the freaking check
[02:59:01] engine light in a car.
[02:59:02] Like to me, that's a check engine light in the car of like just about every team guy
[02:59:09] you know, like when they see other team guys, they're stoked.
[02:59:13] I remember one of my buddies was stationed up in, up in Germany in North Germany with
[02:59:20] the Comsformers.
[02:59:21] He was up there.
[02:59:23] He was up there for three years.
[02:59:25] And I went up to see him one time when I was in Germany and like he was, cause he'd been
[02:59:31] to not, he'd be these were round kick ass, bad ass Comsformer guys, which is awesome.
[02:59:35] And they're great.
[02:59:36] They're studs.
[02:59:38] And but man, when he saw me, it was like he was, he couldn't stop smiling.
[02:59:42] Bro, I was like, bro, you're so happy.
[02:59:44] He goes, bro, it's so good.
[02:59:45] He goes, it's so good to see you and it's so good to speak English.
[02:59:48] He's speaking German.
[02:59:51] So for me to like sit here and think about that, I'm thinking there must be like some,
[02:59:57] there's something wrong with the engine.
[02:59:59] Like there's a check, that's a check engine light.
[03:00:02] The real check engine light is coming on.
[03:00:06] And, and, and then you tell me all these other things like that list, you just rattled off
[03:00:11] of all these things that are going on Amber.
[03:00:13] You're like, Oh, loss of this, loss of that, change of this, change of this, you know.
[03:00:18] Yeah, you can't outrun it.
[03:00:21] Whenever you're processed out and you're a civilian, it all comes crashing down for
[03:00:28] so many.
[03:00:29] And we were one of, one of those cases where we couldn't outrun it anymore.
[03:00:35] And yeah, I mean, if you're good, you're good.
[03:00:37] So, you know, you, I think if you get out and everything is tracking and there's no
[03:00:42] check engine light and you maybe go through some transition, whatever, but you're fine.
[03:00:49] But if you're not, you know, I like that.
[03:00:51] I like that analogy.
[03:00:52] I may use that.
[03:00:53] And we'll steal that from you.
[03:00:54] You can.
[03:00:55] Yeah, of course.
[03:00:56] You can all, Sarah describes Chad as like a light going out.
[03:01:00] And I certainly would have described Marcus the same, like the light in him completely
[03:01:05] went out and, um, but over time, you just start to like sort of like justify it or rationalize
[03:01:14] it in your head.
[03:01:15] Like, well, like, I mean, I guess that's how things are now.
[03:01:18] And they're kind of all like that.
[03:01:20] And, you know, just, you just rationalize it and you try to handle it.
[03:01:26] But like the level of suffering that you guys can endure is so great.
[03:01:33] It's terrifying.
[03:01:34] So this is how you get a dude that's like going through all this and getting his master's
[03:01:37] degree.
[03:01:38] Like that's such a good example of I'll just suck it up.
[03:01:42] Like I'll just suck it up and just do this stupid assignment.
[03:01:45] You know, you're a grown ass man.
[03:01:47] You're getting told by someone to write a paper and you're like, cool, give me the freaking
[03:01:50] computer with rock and roll.
[03:01:52] Yeah.
[03:01:53] Yeah.
[03:01:54] So, um, so you decided you're going to get out.
[03:01:57] What kind of plan do you have?
[03:01:58] Like where are you going to get money from?
[03:02:00] Did you already get a job?
[03:02:01] Did you get a job lined up?
[03:02:02] No, no, I got, I mean, I was, yes.
[03:02:04] So I was lucky enough.
[03:02:05] I had, um, I had a mentor and, you know, and the mentor connected me to some folks.
[03:02:10] And so I did like a New York City tour, met a lot of different people that met a lot of
[03:02:15] people in banking and some other stuff.
[03:02:17] And then got introduced to a lot of West Coast folks and just kind of went out there and
[03:02:22] figured out what's next.
[03:02:24] So I, you know, I consider myself lucky there, um, that I got to, I got to meet a lot of
[03:02:29] people and kind of figure out what I wanted to do.
[03:02:32] So I had a choice, really had a choice.
[03:02:33] And so you got, you actually got a job lined up before you got out, which is freaking amazing
[03:02:39] because sometimes guys don't realize that they get a paycheck every two weeks and that
[03:02:43] when you get out, that paycheck stops.
[03:02:46] And you know, like it's, it's a rough transition for a lot of dudes.
[03:02:50] It could be very rough.
[03:02:51] And so yeah, I was, yeah, I was lucky in that regard, um, you know, looking for something
[03:02:57] else to do.
[03:02:58] And I mean, I wasn't thinking any other way.
[03:03:00] Again, like the way I'm thinking is I'm getting out to go do something, not to, I guess, figure
[03:03:06] it out.
[03:03:07] So.
[03:03:08] And so what was the first gig?
[03:03:09] You were a banker.
[03:03:10] What was it?
[03:03:11] It was a private banker, um, which is really like a fancy way of saying financial advisor.
[03:03:17] And I had some people tell me, don't, don't do it unless you have a lot of rich friends.
[03:03:23] Literally, I got told that by several people.
[03:03:26] Like, really?
[03:03:27] Is that how this works out here?
[03:03:29] Um, but no, I got, I got lucky.
[03:03:30] I worked for a really good team up in LA and, um, yeah, I did that for like a year.
[03:03:35] Did you guys move to LA?
[03:03:36] Yeah.
[03:03:37] Yeah, that was terrible.
[03:03:38] That's why I moved to Texas like within a year after moving there.
[03:03:42] Were you still working at the bank when you moved to Texas?
[03:03:45] No, no, I got hired somewhere else.
[03:03:47] Um, again, through, through my mentor.
[03:03:48] Um, doing the same kind of thing.
[03:03:50] No, doing different stuff like operations now, just kind of more like leadership operations,
[03:03:55] uh, business development.
[03:03:57] And how's your head space at this point?
[03:03:58] Um, I mean, I feel like it, it didn't really, I was like really excited to get out and do
[03:04:08] something different, but I'm not sure.
[03:04:09] He was in a holding pattern at that time.
[03:04:11] I think that there was enough, you had enough tasks to get done and another.
[03:04:16] Yeah, yeah, I was also, and I had something that like I was, there was like excitement.
[03:04:19] Yeah.
[03:04:20] Yeah.
[03:04:21] And I didn't mind LA, but I certainly, you know, we were so disconnected.
[03:04:28] And, um, it was, it was a challenge.
[03:04:31] Like our relationship was a challenge.
[03:04:33] His relationship with the kids was a challenge.
[03:04:36] He drinking was still an issue.
[03:04:38] I was, I was still in the, I was still in the meds, obviously.
[03:04:41] So I was on the meds for seven years straight.
[03:04:42] And by the way, you, you were incorrect.
[03:04:45] I got prescribed while I was still on active duty.
[03:04:48] So from active duty till 2017, November 11th is when I was on.
[03:04:53] So I just meant that like right before you got out of the military is you went your whole
[03:05:01] career, not on meds.
[03:05:03] Like even when he would get injured, he'd be like, I'm not taking that.
[03:05:06] And then, you know, finally relented in like his last year of service.
[03:05:09] And then from that point forward, he was prescribed more and more and more.
[03:05:15] But you know, things were really still deteriorating at home.
[03:05:18] And I remember thinking I can't be stuck in California, like as a single mom.
[03:05:24] My dad had just taken a job at the University of Texas, his offensive coordinator there.
[03:05:30] And Marcus was working in North Carolina commuting.
[03:05:32] And so at one point he came home and he's like, why are paying California taxes?
[03:05:38] I don't even work in the state.
[03:05:41] And we decided to move to Texas.
[03:05:43] And I just thought this is going to be a great place for me to raise the kids and just feel
[03:05:48] better about the kids being raised in a place like Texas.
[03:05:52] And I can probably afford it more than California because I thought we were done.
[03:05:56] I didn't want to be done, but I just thought this is, this is not working.
[03:06:01] So from your perspective, as you're saying, raise the kids, you think that you're going
[03:06:04] to be raising alone because it's that bad.
[03:06:06] Well, it was just, you know, my dreams of my feeling of support for his job in the early
[03:06:16] days sort of turned to like indifference and feeling like resentment that the teams always
[03:06:23] came first.
[03:06:25] I never gave him an ultimatum or anything like that, but it was this sort of like pride
[03:06:31] was replaced with pain.
[03:06:34] And from there, I just kept thinking, well, maybe if we try this, I'll get the feeling
[03:06:38] back.
[03:06:39] Maybe if we try that, I'll get the feeling back.
[03:06:40] Maybe moving will help my family.
[03:06:42] Maybe getting out will help my family.
[03:06:43] And nothing was helping.
[03:06:45] It was actually just deteriorating.
[03:06:47] And so I was basically losing hope that I would ever get the feeling back of like caring.
[03:06:52] I did care, but I just knew that this isn't the way I wanted it.
[03:06:56] This isn't a marriage I want to have.
[03:06:58] And so it felt inevitable.
[03:07:01] I thought at that point we would just divorce.
[03:07:03] I wasn't afraid like anything bad would happen to him.
[03:07:06] I just felt like this isn't workable.
[03:07:10] And what are you feeling, Marcus?
[03:07:12] At this point, you're moved.
[03:07:13] You moved to Texas.
[03:07:15] Is this where you're choking out country club people?
[03:07:17] Yeah.
[03:07:18] Yeah, Texas, it just got worse from there.
[03:07:22] Nothing definitely got better.
[03:07:25] It got worse.
[03:07:27] I hated it there.
[03:07:28] I needed the water.
[03:07:29] I needed the mountains.
[03:07:30] It was flat.
[03:07:31] It was hot.
[03:07:32] I didn't like the people, the town we lived.
[03:07:36] I got along with a few people, but again, nobody got it.
[03:07:40] I felt like it was in that space of nobody gets me.
[03:07:43] And I've been in a war and I can't have a real conversation with anybody because the
[03:07:50] only thing they care about is money.
[03:07:55] I was just going through all of that.
[03:07:57] And again, it wasn't like we were struggling in terms of financially or any of that.
[03:08:02] Honestly, I could have made a million dollars a year.
[03:08:06] Nothing would have changed.
[03:08:07] It was just bad.
[03:08:11] It was just was not, I don't know.
[03:08:14] Again, I think I had less friends when we moved to Texas than I.
[03:08:19] We joke about it, but I don't want to be too angry here over the radio.
[03:08:25] Anybody's listening in?
[03:08:27] Definitely a challenging time.
[03:08:30] And that's when the wheels really came off for us.
[03:08:32] I think that part of what has grounded Marcus has been his ability to get in the water and
[03:08:38] travel.
[03:08:39] And so, you know, in the Navy, you're always stationed near water and in the teams, you're
[03:08:44] doing a lot of traveling.
[03:08:45] And so when we were in Texas, he was basically stuck at home and it was 110 degrees outside
[03:08:51] with no water.
[03:08:53] And he tried to take up golf.
[03:08:55] He's just got to have, you know, that outlet.
[03:08:57] And in taking up golf, he started hanging out with a crew at the country club that were
[03:09:01] very, very, very heavy drinkers.
[03:09:03] And he started to drink.
[03:09:05] Yeah, kind of fell back into the, I think I was drinking hard anyway.
[03:09:10] I don't think it paid.
[03:09:11] You were, but it certainly escalated to a point that, you know, I basically had to like sit
[03:09:16] them down at one point and be like, listen, don't call my husband anymore, because this
[03:09:20] is becoming a problem.
[03:09:23] And it just, our son at that point was...
[03:09:28] Yeah, then he started spiraling a little bit.
[03:09:30] I think just because of what was going on at the house.
[03:09:32] And so then, you know, we're dealing with him not being, you know, just like your typical
[03:09:38] kid that can go to school and get good grades and come home and...
[03:09:42] He's not doing that.
[03:09:43] He's not doing that, you know.
[03:09:45] And so a mix of a little bit of everything.
[03:09:49] I think as it was at that time when, you know, Amber again started just like seeing more
[03:09:55] changes.
[03:09:56] And so she started getting me into brain clinics.
[03:09:59] Yeah.
[03:10:00] And it was actually...
[03:10:01] So, you had 2000...
[03:10:02] There was a former teammate of Marcus's who took his life as well, like one of the first
[03:10:07] Sealed Suicides.
[03:10:09] And his wife actually did a two-part series and the Virginia pilot over Memorial Day.
[03:10:16] And that was in 2016, I believe.
[03:10:20] And I read this article about him and she described him as the light going out.
[03:10:25] And she described all these struggles that he was having.
[03:10:28] And I was like, hold on, this is what we're going through.
[03:10:31] No one's talking about this, though.
[03:10:34] And it was the first time that someone had like had the courage to say that they were
[03:10:38] struggling and had so much respect for that.
[03:10:40] And I was also scared to show this.
[03:10:42] And so what the article basically ended by saying was that there was a pattern of scarring
[03:10:48] found in his brain linked to blast exposure.
[03:10:52] And there was also some mention of CTE.
[03:10:55] And I started researching this and suddenly I was like, I remember going to the garage
[03:11:00] and calling my best friend and I was like, I feel like I've just read about a terminal
[03:11:03] diagnosis like this shit is scary.
[03:11:07] I started really digging into the effects of blasts and repeated head trauma.
[03:11:14] And like his 15 years playing football and 13 years as a breacher.
[03:11:18] And I was like, I don't know that this is purely psychological.
[03:11:22] I don't know that medication is going to help this.
[03:11:24] I know talk therapy is not helping it.
[03:11:27] And if anything, I feel like it could get worse over time and time is of the essence.
[03:11:32] So that's when I really did this heart pivot and I saw him through new eyes.
[03:11:37] And I was suddenly overcome with compassion for him because even though he had become
[03:11:42] a monster, I remembered, I chose to remember who I met and who he was before this deterioration.
[03:11:51] And so I held on to the hope that I could get that person back, but I knew that it was
[03:11:55] going to be really, really, really tough and it might not happen.
[03:11:58] I started like I was most comfortable with Western medicine.
[03:12:02] And even though he was being a really good soldier and like doing, taking all the medication
[03:12:06] that he was prescribed, I was like, I'm not sure that medication is what's, you know,
[03:12:11] fixable here.
[03:12:15] His only diagnosis really was he had his TBI documented all throughout his medical record,
[03:12:19] but it was primarily like PTSD, PTSD.
[03:12:22] And in my mind, I'm like, gosh, I don't know about that because he loved to deploy and
[03:12:27] he would probably still be deploying if, you know, shit didn't go so far south.
[03:12:34] I don't think that this is wrapped up in anything he did overseas.
[03:12:39] What did make more sense was the TBI piece.
[03:12:41] And so I started getting into brain clinics and I got him into like five total and he
[03:12:46] was willing, but you know, it was weeks away from home.
[03:12:49] It was a lot of diagnostics.
[03:12:52] There really wasn't a lot of hope or follow up on the other side.
[03:12:56] And he was becoming more and more and more angry and frustrated.
[03:13:01] And he was really hopeful that I could help.
[03:13:04] And my hope was diminishing month after month of more failed things.
[03:13:12] What do you do at a brain clinic?
[03:13:14] Oh, gosh.
[03:13:15] I mean, they're all different.
[03:13:16] You take, you do a ton of batteries.
[03:13:20] You do a lot of cognitive testing.
[03:13:21] You know, they put you in machines.
[03:13:23] They spin you upside down.
[03:13:24] Like they do a bunch of stuff that are really, in my opinion, for people who could like barely
[03:13:28] walk and talk, you know, or have, you know, autism and all these other things.
[03:13:32] And so for me, I was there just, I felt like passing time.
[03:13:35] I'm like, none of this stuff helps.
[03:13:38] Like, what am I doing here?
[03:13:40] And really, oh, and you do like a lot of balancing.
[03:13:44] I mean, it's for people again, this is my opinion, but it's for people that I consider
[03:13:49] really fucked up, right, that are not like could barely talk.
[03:13:54] Do you at this point think you're fucked up?
[03:13:58] I was just looking for answers.
[03:13:59] I was like, just please, just somebody tell me like something.
[03:14:02] Okay.
[03:14:03] So you think there's questions of what the hell's wrong with 100%.
[03:14:07] Yeah.
[03:14:08] I mean, I left NICO with, you know, with, you know, some, you know, the FMRI is showing
[03:14:12] like, oh, you have these dead and partially brain that, you know, aren't working.
[03:14:17] But and those are just TBIs.
[03:14:18] Those are like TBIs, mild TBIs, mild TBIs.
[03:14:21] He looked at me one time, Choco, like he was trying to get out the door and he used to
[03:14:25] be so like regimented and like, you know, everything had a place and everything was
[03:14:29] organized and he was just kind of like this disorganized functioning, but chaotic guy now.
[03:14:38] And so he's trying to get out of the door for a flight and he was profusely sweating
[03:14:43] and his eyes were gigantic and he looked at me and he was just like sheer terror.
[03:14:48] Like something is wrong with my brain.
[03:14:51] I don't know what's wrong with me.
[03:14:53] Something is not right with my brain.
[03:14:55] And so all throughout his medical record, it's like cognition issues, memory issues,
[03:15:02] balance issues.
[03:15:04] And I'm thinking he's the most capable human I know there's something that's out of his
[03:15:09] control and I don't know.
[03:15:13] Like doctors aren't helping.
[03:15:16] When you when they when they look at these TBIs, these black areas in your brain, what
[03:15:20] do they do about it?
[03:15:21] Do they do anything?
[03:15:22] Are they?
[03:15:23] No, what's the?
[03:15:24] No, because I think it's again, I think it's personalized because I know some individuals
[03:15:29] that had no scarring that were struggling bad and then I know individuals that had a lot
[03:15:35] of scarring and they were fine.
[03:15:37] Maybe they weren't fine or maybe they were saying they were fine and they weren't doing
[03:15:40] well.
[03:15:41] But you know, my my my recollection and the conversations I have, people's people are
[03:15:47] all over the map.
[03:15:49] So individuals with no scarring to, you know, 45 lesions on their brain are acting different.
[03:15:56] And it didn't mean that the ones with higher scarring were acting worse than the ones that
[03:16:01] were, you know, maybe had none.
[03:16:04] So like, I'm not a I'm not a neuroscience or neuroscientist.
[03:16:08] Like I can't tell you why.
[03:16:09] But I think like everything else is just personalized.
[03:16:13] So there's no protocol for like, Oh, memory loss.
[03:16:15] Here's what you need to do or yes, no, there absolutely is.
[03:16:19] There's there's like exercises and yes.
[03:16:21] Yeah, there's there's things you can do.
[03:16:23] There's supplements you can take.
[03:16:25] You know, I do all of it.
[03:16:27] Like I take every supplement that I can find that says this reduces inflammation or this
[03:16:33] helps you, you know, think clearly or, you know, whatever it is like new tropics, like
[03:16:37] I'll try anything now that says, Hey, this is going to make your brain younger.
[03:16:40] That's going to make you, you know, think more clearly.
[03:16:42] Yeah.
[03:16:43] I mean, I think, I think there's still a lot of research around there about, you know,
[03:16:47] what, what we can take.
[03:16:49] But again, I go back to diet and exercise for all matters.
[03:16:55] We needed a nuclear option.
[03:16:56] It all matters.
[03:16:57] Yeah, you're right.
[03:16:58] But it all matters.
[03:16:59] It's not one thing.
[03:17:00] And so how many of these brain clinic things did you go through?
[03:17:02] I would do five.
[03:17:03] And, you know, and honestly, I went to some really good ones from like, like world renowned.
[03:17:08] And I thought they do really good stuff.
[03:17:10] But a lot of these places, as soon as you leave, like it's kind of like they forget you,
[03:17:15] you know, so they collect your money, which are some of these are astronomical, you know,
[03:17:20] K 30 K two weeks a month, whatever it is, and then you leave and they forget about you.
[03:17:26] And that's that was the part that I, you know, I struggle with is that if individuals want
[03:17:30] to get better or these places want to get people better than they need to, there needs
[03:17:35] to be some type of continuum of care, like they just need to check in on an individual
[03:17:39] 30 days, 90 days or whatever it is.
[03:17:41] And, you know, we'll get probably, you know, more into it and what we're doing now.
[03:17:45] But like Amber was saying, I was getting frustrated because I maybe get a diagnosis, but not
[03:17:49] a, not a like, here's exactly what you do as a protocol, go home and do this every day.
[03:17:56] It was just they're all very similar.
[03:17:58] Great for diagnostics.
[03:18:00] Great for diagnostics.
[03:18:01] But what do you do with those diagnostics?
[03:18:03] Yeah, well, they don't make any money either by doing anything else than you showing up
[03:18:08] paying your bill and then telling you to come back so you can pay another bill.
[03:18:13] So what was when was and where was rock bottom and what did it look like?
[03:18:22] Amber, what is, what was it like for you where you are just, it's, can't get any worse than
[03:18:27] this right now?
[03:18:30] Do you mind if I, there's three stories that come to mind and I don't think I've shared
[03:18:36] them publicly.
[03:18:39] The first one was our son called me and said, are you home?
[03:18:45] And I said, no, why?
[03:18:46] He goes, I need to borrow a shirt from dad.
[03:18:50] But when I went to your room, your bedroom doors closed, your bathroom doors closed,
[03:18:53] I'm standing at your closet, but the closet doors closed and I'm afraid if I open it,
[03:18:57] I'm going to find dad hanging.
[03:18:59] And it was like a traumatic conversation, but it was also the normal in our house.
[03:19:06] And I just, you know, that was the first real like, oh, this isn't normal.
[03:19:13] How old is your son at this point?
[03:19:15] 15.
[03:19:16] And, and what is it that he's picking up on?
[03:19:20] It just felt palpable that dad didn't have a purpose anymore.
[03:19:30] And it, it, catastrophe felt imminent.
[03:19:37] And I didn't know what that looked like.
[03:19:38] I didn't know if that meant drinking and driving and wrapping his trucker on a pole.
[03:19:43] I didn't know if that meant taking his life.
[03:19:49] I don't know.
[03:19:50] I just felt like it's coming.
[03:19:52] And then one night he came home and I, you know, 11 o'clock, he's not home, 12 o'clock,
[03:20:02] he's not home, one, two.
[03:20:05] And I heard him come home and I was just, I was like, I need to put the dresser in front
[03:20:09] of the door.
[03:20:10] And I, and then I ran out the back door and I thought, this is not normal.
[03:20:16] This is, he never, he's never, ever, ever been physically aggressive with me, not once.
[03:20:26] But it was tending in the direction that I didn't feel safe because I knew he'd been
[03:20:30] drinking and that particular night, neither one of our kids were home.
[03:20:35] They were both having sleepovers and I just got unnerved and maybe I overreacted.
[03:20:40] But, you know, when you're sitting in a parking lot at 2am, you're just like, this can't,
[03:20:46] this is, is not sustainable.
[03:20:50] And then the third thing that happened, which was like the true rock bottom, the culmination
[03:20:54] of my son feeling these things, me feeling these things, was when our daughter was riding
[03:21:02] with Marcus and he had gotten into some like road construction and sort of like got lost
[03:21:09] or got off track and they were coming to pick me up from an event.
[03:21:13] I was out with my friends.
[03:21:15] And by the time they got to me, he was so frustrated.
[03:21:17] And of course, I didn't know had he been drinking, I didn't, I just see my car coming down the
[03:21:23] street and out comes our daughter and she comes like spilling towards me and she, and
[03:21:28] he tears off down the street and she said, he's, he's crazy mom.
[03:21:33] We can't get in the car with him.
[03:21:34] He'll kill us.
[03:21:36] And she looked at me and she said, how much longer do we have to do this?
[03:21:43] And I said, not one more day.
[03:21:47] And the next day I got on the phone with his best friend who died, Josh, with his family
[03:21:54] who had a foundation.
[03:21:57] And I said, we need help.
[03:22:01] I think if he goes to California and he does this sort of like trifecta brain treatment
[03:22:06] that I can at least have like a minute to figure out next steps.
[03:22:13] I, it was my last hope.
[03:22:16] And so they arranged for the funding.
[03:22:17] I arranged for him to leave what was supposed to be six weeks turned into like three months.
[03:22:23] And during that three months, I came to visit him twice.
[03:22:26] And the first time I came to visit, things were pretty good for a week or so.
[03:22:30] But like on the last day of the trip, everything fell apart.
[03:22:34] And so I went home really defeated and frustrated.
[03:22:37] And in my mind, I was like, I don't think I can do this anymore.
[03:22:42] And we got him out of the house and there's been so much peace in my house since he's
[03:22:48] been away.
[03:22:49] I was doing, I went out and do TMS like the transcrane o-magnetic.
[03:22:55] There was a, and not to knock that because that's incredibly beneficial, but it wasn't
[03:23:00] what we needed at the time.
[03:23:01] It wasn't enough.
[03:23:04] Would I sign him up to do it again?
[03:23:06] Like for an extra bonus to where he's at now, like totally.
[03:23:12] But it wasn't what we needed at the time.
[03:23:14] So I came home thinking, okay, this is it.
[03:23:17] I got to start making plans.
[03:23:18] And I did.
[03:23:19] I started making plans, but I wasn't like totally ready to pull the trigger because I just,
[03:23:22] I never wanted to leave him.
[03:23:24] But I definitely felt like I was in a position where I had to choose him or our kids.
[03:23:30] And so he extended his stay, got more time at the centers.
[03:23:36] And I thought, oh my God, visit him one more time.
[03:23:39] So around this time for all my birthday, I came out to visit him and we were in his truck
[03:23:44] and I said something so benign and he started just like tearing down the five.
[03:23:50] And I thought, if I survive this truck ride, I'm done.
[03:23:55] And I didn't even tell him that I was leaving.
[03:23:57] The next day I got up and I packed my bag and I left for the airport and I came home
[03:24:03] and my mom was there with the kids and I called my dad and I basically told my parents that
[03:24:11] I'm quitting.
[03:24:12] It was the first time that I'd really quit anything.
[03:24:16] And my dad was like, you know, this is not a disappointment to me.
[03:24:22] You are the, you are the most important thing right now and you feel that this is the right
[03:24:28] thing to do.
[03:24:29] Then I support you and whatever you need.
[03:24:33] And I said, I think he's going to be dead in two to five years and I hate that, but
[03:24:40] I'm going to try to start forgiving myself now because I feel like the inevitable is
[03:24:44] going to happen.
[03:24:47] We are the only stabilizing force that he has in his life and when that's gone, I don't
[03:24:53] know.
[03:24:55] And so I was really working on forgiving myself and also like during the, the year or so leading
[03:25:02] into where we were at that point, I had been on my own really in depth journey of like
[03:25:08] healing and getting back into my faith and like tapping into a higher power to help sustain
[03:25:17] me.
[03:25:18] And so there was this massive storm all around me, but I had become the eye of the storm.
[03:25:24] And so things had never been so out of control, but I had never been so in control.
[03:25:30] And so I was thinking clearly, I was making like really strategic decisions, but at the
[03:25:37] same time I was listening to my intuition, which was like, you need to know that you've
[03:25:43] tried everything because one, this is going to stay with your kids.
[03:25:49] And you know, if the worst does happen, they're going to be, they're going to have to deal
[03:25:52] with it for the rest of their lives.
[03:25:54] And two, am I going to be able to know and say that I've tried everything?
[03:26:01] So he was running out of funding in October.
[03:26:05] And at that point, our finances had become a mess and he called home and said, I'm running
[03:26:11] out of funding, like, can I come home?
[03:26:14] And I basically said, you can come home, but as soon as you get here, I want to, I want
[03:26:21] to talk.
[03:26:24] And so he came home and I sat him down and I basically took a completely different approach
[03:26:30] because up until that point, I mean, I definitely developed compassion for him and I had tried
[03:26:34] really hard for, you know, this like 18 months that he was going to all these brain clinics.
[03:26:38] But before that it was like guilt, shame, condemnation, you know, all of the things
[03:26:44] that I was feeling, I was basically projecting onto him and I was creating what I was trying
[03:26:47] to avoid.
[03:26:49] So the more I would guilt him and shame him, the more bad behavior would come from it.
[03:26:53] So the more guilt and shame I would throw on, it was just this toxic cycle.
[03:26:58] So like this, the sort of time where I was reconnecting with just a greater wisdom of
[03:27:06] how to handle the situation, I was overcome with compassion for him and like seeing him
[03:27:13] for his struggles and for them seeming to be out of his control where before I always
[03:27:18] thought like you're, you know, you could figure it out.
[03:27:23] And so I just approached him in a completely new way and I said, if you fight with me,
[03:27:28] I will fight for you every day of the rest of your life, but you have to fight with me.
[03:27:33] You know, I love you.
[03:27:35] I will never leave your side.
[03:27:38] We've got to do this together.
[03:27:40] And he totally, it totally softened him and he was like, what do you want to do?
[03:27:47] And I said, there's one treatment that you haven't tried.
[03:27:52] One of our dear and trusted friends, a couple had had gone down this path.
[03:28:00] So like one other team guy that we had known at the time who'd done this and his situation
[03:28:05] was like, you know, more of a crisis situation where ours was like very deliberate and we
[03:28:10] had been, we'd known about it and talked about it on and off for a year, but it seemed crazy.
[03:28:17] So I re-approached him about it and I said, you know, to go to Mexico and to try this.
[03:28:23] And he was like, I mean, I'll try it.
[03:28:27] Like don't get hopes up.
[03:28:30] I remember saying that to him.
[03:28:31] Like there's no chance that something is going to work because we've tried all the stuff
[03:28:36] that we're supposed to like guys that, you know, other team guys have gone to have gotten
[03:28:41] better or not gotten better, but something that I thought was crazy that I read about
[03:28:46] seemed like it was crazy.
[03:28:48] I didn't think that trying something new was going to even slowly or slightly help.
[03:28:54] But I, you know, I committed just because like I sometimes maybe like you, I feel like
[03:28:59] a, you know, guinea pig.
[03:29:02] I'll try anything if you tell me like it works or it makes me, you know, bigger, faster,
[03:29:05] stronger, smarter.
[03:29:07] So you know, I did some research and it started to make sense that, you know, initially when
[03:29:12] we're talking about psychedelic medicines, you know, they were intended and are intended
[03:29:16] for medical use, not for, you know, recreational parties, you know, anything could be abused
[03:29:20] for recreational parties.
[03:29:22] And so the more I read, the more research I read, I said, that's kind of makes sense.
[03:29:27] I'll, you know, basically I'll give it a go.
[03:29:31] When what was rock bottom for you?
[03:29:34] Like when, when Amber's going through all this, like from the outside looking at you,
[03:29:40] just a little, seeming like there's just no hope.
[03:29:44] What was rock bottom for you?
[03:29:45] No hope, like no hope, no passion, no drive, anger, frustration, sadness, you know, depression,
[03:29:54] all of it.
[03:29:55] Like it just was like, again, going back to what we talked about earlier, didn't want
[03:30:00] to do the things I enjoyed doing.
[03:30:02] Didn't want to hang out with anybody.
[03:30:04] Didn't want to have a conversation.
[03:30:05] Didn't want to make do small talk.
[03:30:08] Just.
[03:30:09] All the above, just done.
[03:30:11] Yeah, just done.
[03:30:14] And like everything else I've had, I have days of like, I don't want to call it joy,
[03:30:21] but just, you know, up like some uplifting days, but the majority of days were down and
[03:30:27] you know, including weeks on end.
[03:30:29] Some days I didn't want to get out of bed.
[03:30:30] Like I said, I just shut my phone off where now, you know, we joke about it.
[03:30:35] As long as you're trending upwards, you're going to have like you said, like, you know,
[03:30:39] yours is different.
[03:30:40] You're, you know, you're getting upset over a situation.
[03:30:42] You know, that's completely normal.
[03:30:45] I'll still have some down days, but they'll only last like an hour or before they would
[03:30:50] last for literally days.
[03:30:52] And you know, I think that just takes time over, you know, what we've been working on
[03:30:56] over the last couple of years.
[03:30:58] But yeah, I was just, I was just checked out of everything.
[03:31:02] Medically, you know, mentally, physically, emotionally.
[03:31:07] There was no, there was nothing in sight.
[03:31:10] It was just like flat, clear, you know, not clear, but flat and, and really nothing looked
[03:31:17] forward to.
[03:31:21] Just real quick, how the hell were you guys paying for like everything?
[03:31:25] Like just life?
[03:31:26] Like you weren't working for months on end.
[03:31:28] How?
[03:31:29] Well, it was a struggle.
[03:31:31] It was a real struggle.
[03:31:34] Remaxed out a lot of credit cards.
[03:31:35] Marcus has, he's medically retired soon.
[03:31:38] Yeah, we did.
[03:31:39] Oh, okay.
[03:31:40] Yeah.
[03:31:41] So I, but I was like, got it, which was not.
[03:31:42] Yeah, it's not.
[03:31:43] I mean, but at least it's like groceries, right?
[03:31:44] I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it was.
[03:31:47] And we had money, no, we had, you know, we had saved money just from, you know, from
[03:31:50] the teams and stuff over the years.
[03:31:52] I'm trying to think, were you working at the time or no?
[03:31:56] Well, Caden had also gotten our Senate was dealing with some chronic health issues.
[03:32:00] And so I was actually pulled away from, from.
[03:32:04] So we were paying out of pocket for a lot of these medical expenses because most of
[03:32:07] the stuff, a lot of stuff wasn't covered under insurance and you're probably dealing with
[03:32:10] it with some of the stuff you're doing.
[03:32:12] But yeah, you know, luckily we had a lot of these foundations are, you know, are there
[03:32:18] for like these reasons.
[03:32:20] So, all right.
[03:32:21] So we get the deal where we're like, well, this is our last shot, last shot at the one
[03:32:28] treatment that you haven't tried yet, which is psychedelic.
[03:32:32] What is it, drugs, psychedelic plants?
[03:32:34] What do you call it?
[03:32:35] We'll call it, we'll call it a psychedelic assisted therapy, psychedelic assisted therapy.
[03:32:40] So the drugs are psychedelics.
[03:32:42] You know, psych, psychedelic mind manifesting, psychedelic, that's the meaning of it.
[03:32:48] Psychedelic drugs are the, you know, the class.
[03:32:52] The way this is going this medical route, they, they're including therapy in it because
[03:32:57] what they're showing with the research is that if they, they take the drug and then
[03:33:01] they bring in the therapy with it, the results are like through the roof because the psychedelic
[03:33:07] really opens your mind up for change.
[03:33:09] Basically gives you new, like think of it as if it's snowing and you have like fresh
[03:33:14] powder and tracks haven't been on the, on the powder yet.
[03:33:18] That's what psychedelics do.
[03:33:19] It basically gives you like this new blanket of snow to build your own new tracks and you
[03:33:24] could, you can still build those bad.
[03:33:26] So you can still build in bad habits.
[03:33:28] But the idea is if you have that coach or that therapist or that support, you can build
[03:33:33] new tracks, like good tracks, good habits.
[03:33:36] And that's, that's the idea of psychedelic assisted therapy.
[03:33:39] At the time we had no idea what we were signing up for.
[03:33:42] I don't even know what we're talking about right now when, when I heard about this.
[03:33:45] But there's a team guy who his wife was like, Hey, you need to do this.
[03:33:49] Yeah.
[03:33:50] Yeah.
[03:33:51] And I mean, that is the essence of our community is I just take care of one another.
[03:33:53] And so they'd been there for us in the past and we knew about their struggles.
[03:33:58] They knew about our struggles, but, um, you know, thankfully she felt compelled to reach
[03:34:04] out to me and then I talked to him and then he talked to Marcus and because we trusted
[03:34:08] and respected them so much, I felt comfortable.
[03:34:12] I didn't do an ounce of research.
[03:34:15] I did nothing.
[03:34:16] I, I just convinced him to go trusted them, got him on the plane.
[03:34:21] And I literally looked at the steering wheel of my car like this is it.
[03:34:25] I did, I did the research.
[03:34:27] And like I said, from what, from initially what I thought was, you know, I'll, I'll use
[03:34:32] the term crazy to, it started to make sense that again, these were intended for medical
[03:34:39] use and, you know, it was stigmatized because we all know it as just crazy, crazy drugs
[03:34:45] that people around the sixties and seventies, you know, ran around concerts doing, losing
[03:34:49] their minds.
[03:34:50] And they're intended for, for, for mental health and behavioral health use and now substance
[03:34:56] abuse and, you know, host of other things.
[03:34:58] So, so the more I read, the more it made sense.
[03:35:00] Um, and I figured, okay, I'm going to give this a shot.
[03:35:04] So you get on a plane.
[03:35:06] You just said you go, well, you drop them off at the airport.
[03:35:09] Yeah.
[03:35:10] And I'm like, this is it.
[03:35:11] This is like putting everything on the table.
[03:35:13] And if it doesn't work, I'm going to have to come back to the drawing board.
[03:35:16] If it does work, the best I can hope for is that it buys me some time to find something
[03:35:21] that's a little bit more comfortable.
[03:35:23] I didn't think it was like a magic bullet, but I definitely thought that if anything,
[03:35:27] it was buying me some time.
[03:35:29] Um, and then I went to see him the next day.
[03:35:33] So I'm talking about that whenever, but, well, yeah, let's get, so you get on a plane and
[03:35:38] where do you fly through Marcus?
[03:35:40] Coming to San Diego and then sweet.
[03:35:42] Yeah.
[03:35:43] And then, uh, caravan down to a clinic in Mexico.
[03:35:48] I've been operating for a long time.
[03:35:50] The good reputation.
[03:35:52] Um, we'll keep those separated for now because, uh, one, just kind of, you know, security
[03:35:57] reasons guys going down, we like to try to keep the two separated.
[03:36:01] Wait, what are we keeping separated?
[03:36:03] Just us, what we're doing with the nonprofit and then the, you know, the retreats that
[03:36:07] a lot of the people are going to for these, uh, to do these medicines.
[03:36:11] So we just don't like to connect.
[03:36:13] It's the two.
[03:36:14] I don't understand.
[03:36:15] That's okay.
[03:36:16] That's good.
[03:36:17] We'll just, we'll talk about it as we go.
[03:36:19] So, uh, when you say keep these things separated, just mean like different clinics or something
[03:36:24] like disclosing the retreat location or name or anything.
[03:36:27] Okay.
[03:36:28] Okay.
[03:36:29] Got it.
[03:36:30] Yeah.
[03:36:31] For sure.
[03:36:32] No problem.
[03:36:33] Got that.
[03:36:34] Okay.
[03:36:35] Check.
[03:36:36] Check in Roger.
[03:36:37] Sorry.
[03:36:38] My communication skills were terrible there.
[03:36:39] So I apologize.
[03:36:40] No, it's all good.
[03:36:41] So you go to this clinic.
[03:36:42] You're going to do it too?
[03:36:43] No, the one who is escorting you, you just bro it out.
[03:36:48] He's growing out and make sure I'm good.
[03:36:49] Uh, I don't know what to expect.
[03:36:51] What is the place like?
[03:36:52] Is this like, no, awesome.
[03:36:54] Is it like a beautiful, like beautiful home, overlooking the water, everything, perfect
[03:36:59] food, uh, staff, seem like a hospital or does it seem like a does not seem like a does
[03:37:04] not seem like a, but it is set up with hospital equipment.
[03:37:07] Yeah.
[03:37:08] And it's set up with like full medical, you know, you're on a EKG or a heart rate monitor.
[03:37:12] You're doing your analysis to make sure there's nothing in your system.
[03:37:16] You're doing blood work to make sure you're not lying.
[03:37:19] Um, there's like, there's a whole protocol and the more stringent you are on the screening,
[03:37:25] the better the outcome.
[03:37:26] Uh, individuals that have trouble with psychedelic medicine again is the screening.
[03:37:33] So if the screen is not done correctly, there can be issues.
[03:37:37] You screen properly is almost little to no issues.
[03:37:40] And so the more that this whole industry moves forward, um, it's just got to be done correctly.
[03:37:45] And so this place again, has been running for a long time, had been doing it the right
[03:37:50] way, not an underground shaman that is getting drugs from God knows where and saying here,
[03:37:57] do this, it's good for you.
[03:37:58] Getting drugs from Fred.
[03:38:00] Yeah.
[03:38:01] Right.
[03:38:02] And who's making it in his bathtub.
[03:38:03] Exactly.
[03:38:04] Uh, who was a chemist in high school.
[03:38:06] How long are you there for like, okay, so, so you show up?
[03:38:09] Yeah, it's, it's a, it's a three to five day event.
[03:38:13] Summer, summer shorter, summer longer.
[03:38:17] Um, you do this, you know, you do a full, like I was saying, a full intake, a full medical
[03:38:22] screening.
[03:38:23] Uh, you talk to a psychedelic coach who's a therapist first.
[03:38:27] So like a psychologist or like a licensed therapist who's trained in psychedelic medicine,
[03:38:32] they prepare you for the experience.
[03:38:34] And again, uh, the better outcomes are the ones who prepare the most.
[03:38:39] So if you can, uh, what, what that individual does at licensed professional is going to
[03:38:45] talk to you about what your experience may be like or what you're going through and what
[03:38:49] you may experience.
[03:38:50] And the idea is to prepare your, they call it set and setting your mindset, get your
[03:38:56] mindset in the right place to go into these treatments.
[03:38:58] So sometimes you hear about these bad trips, sometimes bad trips are just that an individual's
[03:39:06] mindset was not in a good place.
[03:39:08] They were at a Slayer concert.
[03:39:09] They were at a Slayer concert or yes, for sure.
[03:39:13] Or they watched like a nasty movie that they started thinking about during their experience
[03:39:18] that just turned it sideways.
[03:39:20] But here's the other thing about bad experiences, what we're learning.
[03:39:23] Some of those bad experiences actually many or most of them, especially with team guys
[03:39:28] and other veterans, they're, they're good experiences.
[03:39:32] Those bad experiences, they have to go through to get out the other side.
[03:39:36] So the bad experiences are some of the shit that they may experience as a kid.
[03:39:41] Maybe there's some sexual assaults that went on as a child.
[03:39:45] Maybe, uh, you know, maybe they did watch their friend get popped in the head and die
[03:39:49] right in front of them and they experienced that on their, you know, on their journey.
[03:39:54] So all types of that.
[03:39:55] So those are bad trips, but those bad trips are actually like showing, showing them working
[03:40:01] through stuff.
[03:40:02] But, you know, people may take years doing it through quote unquote talk therapy or
[03:40:06] psychotherapy.
[03:40:08] You can do that in a few days done properly.
[03:40:11] Again, not at a Slayer concert with Joe the shaman.
[03:40:17] So what's the, so you screen your screen, you do, um, you do some integration, uh, excuse
[03:40:23] me, some preparation.
[03:40:24] Again, this is from the therapist coach.
[03:40:27] Um, once that's done, um, you're, you're given the medicine and just like you would
[03:40:35] take ibuprofen or Tylenol or Xedrin or probably a few others that I don't know for headache,
[03:40:42] psychedelic drugs are the same way.
[03:40:43] So there's, you know, Ibogaine and there's a psilocybin and there's MDMA and there's,
[03:40:50] um, what am I missing?
[03:40:53] I was good at you hearing about, um, so there's all these psychedelic drugs that slightly
[03:40:59] do they're similar, but they do something slightly different, but they're all relatively
[03:41:04] trying to solve the same problem.
[03:41:06] And so, um, the, the drug that I experienced was called Ibogaine.
[03:41:10] And, um, again, to me, you could have told me I was eating fruit loops.
[03:41:16] Um, I'm like, okay, fruit loops.
[03:41:19] That's that I had no idea.
[03:41:21] Is it a pill?
[03:41:22] It's a, yeah, it's a pill.
[03:41:23] It's just like powdered pill.
[03:41:24] It's in, it's in pill form.
[03:41:26] You take it, uh, dependent upon your body weight.
[03:41:29] Um, and, but again, it's personalized.
[03:41:32] So I metabolize shit faster than you might.
[03:41:34] So what works for me, if I take, I don't know, I'm making this number 800 milligrams, you
[03:41:40] may need, you know, 1.2 grams.
[03:41:42] And just because I maybe metabolize it faster or slower.
[03:41:46] So it's, it's science, but there's also a little bit of subjectivity to the amount that
[03:41:51] individuals need.
[03:41:52] I'm having a flashback of when you were talking about when you were drinking for the first
[03:41:55] time, you're like, I don't understand how this is going to make me like think any different.
[03:41:58] Oh, this is exactly the thing.
[03:42:00] This is probably even worse because I mean, we're talking about a, we're talking about
[03:42:05] going on a journey here.
[03:42:06] The world's most powerful psychedelics.
[03:42:07] And so that's what I was getting at is Ibogaine is considered, uh, one of the world's most
[03:42:12] powerful psychedelics.
[03:42:13] That's why we call it the nuclear option.
[03:42:15] Not everybody needs to do this.
[03:42:16] No, no way near or not even close to everybody needs to do this.
[03:42:20] But what we're seeing is, um, some of the stuff that I was experiencing, you know, as
[03:42:26] I was transitioning out of the teams and like the years of like, you know, if you want to
[03:42:29] call it co-morbidity of other things, like, oh, he's a little depressed and maybe he's
[03:42:34] got some TBI's and maybe he's going on, you know, going through some shit with transition
[03:42:39] and you know, Ibogaine's good.
[03:42:42] But for an individual that maybe just going through a little bit of depression, maybe
[03:42:46] can't get themselves out of, you know, out of a hole, maybe Ibogaine is not the right
[03:42:51] thing for it because it is, it is a really rough journey.
[03:42:54] And I'm sure like you said, you've talked to some friends.
[03:42:57] Um, it's not fun.
[03:42:58] Like it's not, it's not joy at all.
[03:43:00] And anybody who takes that for recreational use, like I want to talk to them.
[03:43:04] And actually they need to go talk to a psych because there's something definitely wrong
[03:43:08] with that individual.
[03:43:10] So you take it.
[03:43:12] Yeah.
[03:43:13] You take, so you take this medicine.
[03:43:14] I'm going to call it a medicine.
[03:43:15] You know, I don't think technically we can call it yet, but we're calling it medicines
[03:43:18] because they are medicines.
[03:43:20] And then, you know, you lie down in bed, you put, um, like noise canceling headphones
[03:43:25] on, uh, you put eye shades on and, you know, within an hour, you start kind of going into
[03:43:33] this experience and for everybody, it's different.
[03:43:37] Um, but you basically go on a, you know, six to eight to 12 or even longer hour, uh, journey
[03:43:48] and for everybody else again, because it's your mind or my mind, uh, and our minds are
[03:43:53] different.
[03:43:54] What I'm going to experience is going to be different from what you experienced or from
[03:43:57] what, you know, you experience and it's working on a few different things.
[03:44:01] The one is the story and that's like the psychological piece, the trauma piece where, um, if there
[03:44:08] are real things that really fucked you up in the past, whatever it is.
[03:44:13] So a lot of the addiction, right, is coming, finding out from things that happen in individuals
[03:44:19] lives, not just because they like to drink or they like to do heroin or whatever.
[03:44:24] They're doing it because something fucked them up so bad that they turn to that, whatever
[03:44:29] it is.
[03:44:30] They don't need to discuss what, whatever that is, um, the psychedelic does a really
[03:44:36] good job and they say it's a jokester too, because it will show you that and it'll fuck
[03:44:42] with you too.
[03:44:43] Um, but the thing is what you just said, sometimes the only way, um, the only way, the only way
[03:44:54] to heal is through and the only way to conquer something is through.
[03:45:01] Like you have to face it and we know that and you can't, you can't bury stuff or if
[03:45:05] you have an issue with a, with a team guy that you work with, if you just keep burying
[03:45:10] or put stuff on, off on the side, it's going to blow up one day.
[03:45:14] But if you can take that person and say, Hey, let's, let's settle our differences.
[03:45:17] What's going on here?
[03:45:18] Like you don't like me.
[03:45:19] I don't like you.
[03:45:20] Why?
[03:45:21] We have to work together.
[03:45:22] If you don't have that conversation, it's, it's going to be messed up forever.
[03:45:26] So that, that's what the psychedelic does to the mind.
[03:45:28] It shows you the problem that you're dealing with and you face it in this 12 hour journey
[03:45:34] and it could suck.
[03:45:35] And for me, it, it was really tough.
[03:45:37] I mean, it was, it was 12 hours of like gore and blood and just crap.
[03:45:45] But when I was done, it literally felt like I just took a thousand pounds out of a backpack.
[03:45:51] It was just like, it was just like this relief that I never had before and all this like
[03:45:57] pent up frustration that Amber's talking about that just like went away.
[03:46:03] And for everybody else, it's different.
[03:46:05] And so what talk therapy or psychotherapy can take five or 10 or 15 years.
[03:46:11] I mean, I still have friends up in LA that are still seeing a psychologist for 20 years.
[03:46:15] And I'm like, dude, I can help you out probably in a week.
[03:46:19] Like you've been paying this person.
[03:46:20] It's obviously not helping.
[03:46:24] You know, it can, it can do that in a much faster timeframe.
[03:46:29] And like Amber said, it's not a panacea.
[03:46:30] It's not a magic bullet.
[03:46:33] Sometimes you need to go down twice.
[03:46:35] Sometimes maybe to do it three times.
[03:46:37] Maybe you need to do it once a year.
[03:46:40] Everybody's different.
[03:46:41] But again, I don't want people who are listening to get the wrong idea that, that this is a
[03:46:47] one and done or it's like a magic pill because, you know, everybody would be rushing to do
[03:46:52] it and think like, again, you know, all my answers, you know, be solved and just this,
[03:46:56] you know, this bottle right here, it takes a lot of work.
[03:46:59] The experience itself is going to suck.
[03:47:02] It's going to be miserable.
[03:47:03] You're going to cry.
[03:47:04] You're going to throw up.
[03:47:05] Like you're going to like nobody wants to face their rapist.
[03:47:08] You know what I mean?
[03:47:09] So if they were, they were raped as a young child and that's what's affecting you for
[03:47:15] the right, like you're going to face that individual during, and that's, that's pretty
[03:47:18] traumatic for an individual.
[03:47:20] Right.
[03:47:21] If they're growing up and their uncle was molesting them for years upon years, you know, upon
[03:47:26] years, if that's still affecting them in their life, they're going to face that in their
[03:47:29] journey and that's tough.
[03:47:30] But you know what?
[03:47:31] You need to face that to move on.
[03:47:33] And that's what these medicines do.
[03:47:35] They also work on the brain.
[03:47:36] So they promote neurogenesis, which meaning it's like, you know, brain growth and they,
[03:47:40] they're turning on parts of the brain that may have not been working before.
[03:47:43] And I think that's what we're seeing in the success for a lot of these guys is if they
[03:47:47] do have mild TBIs and they're, they have these scarring that we're talking about and maybe
[03:47:52] parts of their brain, we're not allowing them the function well, it is allowing them the
[03:47:56] function well now.
[03:47:57] So there's a host of things and I don't want to get into science because I'm way above
[03:48:01] my pay grade in Chaco, but you know, this experience was, was radical.
[03:48:06] It was, you know, did a 180 for me.
[03:48:09] It was life changing and life saving.
[03:48:11] Amber actually came in the day after and I walked down the hallway and I, we just, first
[03:48:18] of all, I freaked out because it hit me when I was in the car headed there.
[03:48:25] I was very uncomfortable and I was raised, you know, super conservative and I feel like,
[03:48:31] you know, I was in the survival mode and suddenly like this piece had come and in the car on
[03:48:39] the way there, I had this moment where I was like, I can't go.
[03:48:42] I don't know what we've just done.
[03:48:44] I think what we've done is bad.
[03:48:47] And I'm too scared to face it.
[03:48:50] And my girlfriend was like, you have to go.
[03:48:54] He's asking for you.
[03:48:55] And we told him you're coming.
[03:48:56] So you have to go.
[03:48:57] And I walked in there so uptight and scared of, oh, it was the most nerve wracking feeling
[03:49:04] and I heard him walking down the hall and I was just like, oh my gosh, please, please
[03:49:11] let this have worked.
[03:49:13] And he came around the hall and immediately I could just see that he was back.
[03:49:19] It was like, it was literally like being reunited with the person that I met, which is a complete
[03:49:30] and utter, excuse me, language mindfuck.
[03:49:34] It really threw me in the best ways and also in the worst ways because then you start to
[03:49:41] doubt it and second guess, like it's too good to be true and like you're sliding your walls
[03:49:45] down and you're like, oh, don't do that because this isn't going to last.
[03:49:50] So a lot of spouses have experienced that and that mild freak out was certainly replaced
[03:49:56] with this feeling of complete relief.
[03:49:58] And then how do we maintain this?
[03:50:02] Yeah, so the first thing I did, I said, Amra, this is exactly, I mean, the first thing out
[03:50:06] of my mouth was like, this is exactly what the guys need.
[03:50:08] I say, we keep getting phone calls of friends that are struggling like I was.
[03:50:14] I'm like, dude, I can't take care of you because I can't even fucking take care of myself right
[03:50:17] now.
[03:50:19] So when I experienced this, like that's the first thing I said.
[03:50:22] I was like, we got to figure out a way to get our friends here and do the same thing.
[03:50:26] We have to figure out how to raise money because someone paid for me $4,000 or whatever it
[03:50:31] was.
[03:50:32] And so I said, well, how do we get our buddies and families that are struggling to do the
[03:50:37] same thing?
[03:50:38] He said, I don't know.
[03:50:39] We said, well, we got to go raise money.
[03:50:42] We'll start a nonprofit.
[03:50:43] Again, had no idea what we were talking about.
[03:50:46] We'll start a nonprofit.
[03:50:48] We'll go raise money and then we'll fund our friends so they could get the same healing
[03:50:52] that I feel like I'm experiencing right now.
[03:50:54] We thought maybe a handful.
[03:50:55] Yeah, we didn't know.
[03:50:57] We didn't know.
[03:50:58] Honestly, we didn't know.
[03:50:59] And that's what we did.
[03:51:02] Well then we were contacted by Elizabeth and she said, I want to give to a veteran organization.
[03:51:10] He actually had his treatment on Veterans Day.
[03:51:13] So it was really special.
[03:51:14] And then end of year giving, right after that in December, made this lady contact Marcus
[03:51:20] and say, I need a recommendation for a veterans organization to give to.
[03:51:24] And he goes, we can't give you a tax write off, but if you pay this clinic, I could get
[03:51:33] five of my friends down there for a treatment that could save their life.
[03:51:37] And she was totally on board.
[03:51:39] And that's what really launched what has become vets.
[03:51:44] But we don't want to talk about it.
[03:51:46] We don't want to talk about it because it's so stigmatized and so taboo to say you're
[03:51:51] struggling.
[03:51:52] Maybe some of our internal friends knew primarily because the wives were talking, not because
[03:51:56] the guys were talking.
[03:51:58] And so my thing was, I don't want to jinx it.
[03:52:01] I don't want to, I don't know if it'll work for everyone.
[03:52:04] I don't know if it'll continue working for us.
[03:52:06] I don't want to talk about it until 12 months have gone by and we've raised money and provided
[03:52:12] this opportunity for 12 other guys to go down there.
[03:52:17] And at that point, maybe we'll talk about it.
[03:52:21] This one's not one for PR and stepping out of the shadows.
[03:52:26] So this was a big deal, but I thought, well, we're just going to buy ourselves a year here
[03:52:30] and get some really good data and come out with a little bit of foundation beneath us.
[03:52:37] And his treatment was on Veterans Day.
[03:52:40] So November 11th would have been the one year mark.
[03:52:43] Chad Wilkinson took his life on October 28th.
[03:52:47] And we were sitting in his funeral just days before the one year anniversary of Marcus,
[03:52:53] or right around the same time.
[03:52:56] And we had been to the Little Creek Chapel so many times for more funerals.
[03:53:02] And this felt so different.
[03:53:04] And I was seeing all the same guys that would deploy with Marcus and be at all these other
[03:53:08] funerals.
[03:53:09] And they had more medals and they had more gray hair and they had more wrinkles and they
[03:53:14] were getting older and becoming like you could see in their faces that they were struggling.
[03:53:23] And this is the first suicide funeral I'd been to.
[03:53:26] And I started shaking.
[03:53:27] I had this tremble release response at Chad's funeral where I was jackhammering and shaking.
[03:53:35] The whole bench was shaking.
[03:53:36] People were looking down like, what is going on down there?
[03:53:39] And I was just overcome with this conviction of like, if we don't talk, if we don't step
[03:53:44] out and get out of our comfort zone, more guys are going to die by suicide.
[03:53:51] And we're going to just do whatever it takes to prevent that because this community and
[03:53:56] this chapel can't take that.
[03:53:58] So we're not going to let that happen.
[03:54:02] And so we started basically just stopped hiding kind of what we were doing and started speaking
[03:54:08] about it a little bit because we thought, well, if we start speaking about it, you know,
[03:54:13] and of course we talked to Sarah, we just said, hey, we're just going to start talking
[03:54:20] about this a little bit so people know.
[03:54:22] So in the unlikely event that an individual is getting to the point where Chad got to,
[03:54:27] they might pause and go, oh, you know what?
[03:54:30] There's something I haven't tried.
[03:54:32] Or there's this thing that I heard is working for some individuals after, because mostly
[03:54:37] a lot, I mean, most of these individuals are on the same path.
[03:54:40] Like they go to NICO, they go to these brain clinics, they're on a bunch of these mood
[03:54:44] stabilizers.
[03:54:46] And then they're like, okay, well, well now what?
[03:54:49] So I at that point just said, you know, fuck my career, because I was still like trying
[03:54:54] to figure out like to get into corporate America and, you know, whatever.
[03:54:59] I just said, I think this is more important.
[03:55:04] And if someone is not going to hire me or doesn't want to work with me because we're
[03:55:10] talking about psychedelic medicines, then like shame on them.
[03:55:14] Like I don't need, I don't want to work with that individual.
[03:55:16] Like open your mind a little bit.
[03:55:17] We found something that works.
[03:55:19] And that's the story here.
[03:55:20] The story is not Marcus and Amber running around doing psychedelic drugs or running
[03:55:24] a cult, which we were told by the way initially we were running a cult, which is kind of funny.
[03:55:30] But no, we're trying to heal people.
[03:55:32] That's all.
[03:55:33] We found something that worked.
[03:55:34] And that's what happened.
[03:55:36] And so that was it.
[03:55:37] We just started speaking about it.
[03:55:39] We started doing, you know, interview here, interview there, maybe a small podcast, you
[03:55:44] know, and, you know, one thing leads to another.
[03:55:47] People get interested.
[03:55:49] People with money want to donate.
[03:55:51] And you also know how the community is.
[03:55:54] Like what I love most about the community is just this like unwavering commitment to
[03:55:59] caring for one another.
[03:56:00] And for every person that comes through our program, because the efficacy rates are so
[03:56:06] high.
[03:56:07] They refer back three to five of their buddies.
[03:56:10] And so it creates a need that we simply, you know, are having really hard time meeting.
[03:56:17] But to date, we've provided funding for over 600 other operators, not all CLs.
[03:56:23] I mean, we serve all branches of special operations, but, you know, it's really taken on a life
[03:56:29] of its own.
[03:56:30] And it absolutely started at Chad Wilkinson's funeral.
[03:56:34] And this just goal of ending veteran suicide.
[03:56:40] Did you, your original, like when you first came out and started talking about it, that
[03:56:45] was after Chad's funeral?
[03:56:46] Yeah.
[03:56:47] Oh, that at Chad's funeral is whenever I was so convicted of like everything we do, I'm
[03:56:56] keeping Chad Wilkinson and Sarah and the kids right here because the fallout from suicide,
[03:57:06] like to survive all these combat deployments and then lose your loved one to suicide.
[03:57:13] Like, oh, I can't even fathom.
[03:57:16] Like I was just super convicted.
[03:57:20] How long did it take to start getting traction?
[03:57:24] Almost immediately.
[03:57:27] Almost immediately.
[03:57:28] We had gotten traction, mega traction in terms of the need.
[03:57:32] But what didn't necessarily match that was the donor dollars.
[03:57:37] It was very stigmatized.
[03:57:38] I mean, we're talking about four years ago at this point.
[03:57:43] It was still very stigmatized and unknown.
[03:57:46] Like there's a lot of, there's a lack of education around psychedelic therapies and then there's
[03:57:50] misinformation around psychedelics.
[03:57:52] And so to combat those two stigmas and to also try to combat the stigma of saying you
[03:57:56] need help, it's been like, you know, pretty dicey.
[03:58:00] Yeah.
[03:58:01] That's a war on all fronts right there.
[03:58:03] Yeah.
[03:58:04] Yeah.
[03:58:05] Well, then you go into the real fun war of like military leadership and policymakers
[03:58:11] and big pharma and VA and, you know.
[03:58:15] But it seems like it's getting really good traction right now.
[03:58:19] Is it, isn't it?
[03:58:21] Yeah.
[03:58:22] Yeah.
[03:58:23] Because veterans are driving it and the veterans driving it at the tip tip of the spear is
[03:58:27] the seal community and the broader special operations community.
[03:58:30] And like, I don't know if I needed to get something done, I'd call you guys.
[03:58:36] So the charity is called, well, you got on your t-shirt there, right?
[03:58:41] It's VETS solutions.
[03:58:42] Yeah.
[03:58:43] Right.
[03:58:44] VETS, veterans exploring treatment solutions.
[03:58:46] And it's vet solutions.org.
[03:58:49] If people want to go and check that out and can they donate from there and all that.
[03:58:54] And so what's the plan there on that side of things?
[03:58:57] Just continue to grow, continue to accept donations, continue to get more people treatment.
[03:59:02] Jocko, we get upwards of 10 qualified applications a day needing funding.
[03:59:08] A day.
[03:59:09] And it is so overwhelming.
[03:59:12] Like I actually dread it when we have to go through applications.
[03:59:15] We do it on Mondays and we have a certain number of grants or funds allocated.
[03:59:24] And choosing who gets those funds when everyone is so deserving.
[03:59:28] It's like...
[03:59:29] So we actually, I mean, we actually have to, you know, we had an algorithm built in to
[03:59:33] like rack and stack who's done the most combat deployments.
[03:59:37] Like what are they going through?
[03:59:38] So it actually, you know, it ranks the individuals, you know, or if there's like an immediate
[03:59:42] crisis, they immediately get put to the top and they get a phone call immediately.
[03:59:45] And so there's a whole, you know, there's a whole system to it because again, of those
[03:59:49] 10, if we're talking about only being able to support 175 to 200 a year, there's a, you
[03:59:57] know, there's most of those people are not getting funding.
[04:00:00] There are thousands, tens of thousands that could use it or need it or are trying to access
[04:00:10] it.
[04:00:11] And so if they're, or schedule one substances in the United States, they have to travel
[04:00:15] abroad.
[04:00:16] So, you know, one of our, I would say most effective talking points when we're talking
[04:00:20] to policy makers and leader leaders is that, you know, our nation's veterans are leaving
[04:00:28] the country they fought for for access to meaningful care.
[04:00:31] And this is so far superior to anything else that's currently available, at least from
[04:00:36] my perspective, what I'm seeing is there's healing happening in four key areas of veteran
[04:00:41] suffering.
[04:00:42] And so when we were in such a bad way, if you would have given me immediate relief in
[04:00:46] one of the four areas, it would have been an absolute blessing.
[04:00:50] The fact that it provides immediate relief for most people in all four categories is
[04:00:54] unheard of.
[04:00:56] So the first category is psychological trauma.
[04:00:59] So anything that's affecting someone, you know, even on a subconscious level, whether
[04:01:03] it's childhood trauma, repressed trauma that, you know, they don't even remember war trauma,
[04:01:13] whatever the source of trauma is, it deals with that.
[04:01:15] And like Marcus said, it shows you the trauma and then you're able to work through it, confront
[04:01:19] it, deal with it, put it away, be done with it.
[04:01:23] There's an anti-addictive benefit, which is really ironic because these drugs are scheduled
[04:01:28] as being addictive and like a high potential for abuse.
[04:01:32] They're actually being used to treat addiction, but because they're so challenging to even
[04:01:38] research in the United States, that data is largely missing.
[04:01:41] So Marcus and, you know, so many other guys that are going down there might not have a
[04:01:46] full blown addiction, but they have substance use disorder.
[04:01:51] And so for Marcus, it was alcohol.
[04:01:53] Some guys go down there because they're hooked on opioids.
[04:01:57] However the addiction is, it like resets, it scrubs and resets those receptors and the
[04:02:06] addiction, you know, no longer has that brand.
[04:02:12] There's a physiological benefit as it pertains to TBI.
[04:02:16] At VETS, we primarily write grants for Ibogaine and 5MEO DMT protocol.
[04:02:22] That's two of the six psychedelics that we can provide funding for.
[04:02:26] Most guys are going down there to do Ibogaine and 5MEO.
[04:02:30] We're just wrapping up a study with Stanford.
[04:02:33] The preliminary data is not released yet, but I think that it will show significant improvements
[04:02:38] in cognitive functioning, neurological functioning.
[04:02:40] It creates this really incredible neuroplasticity in the brain.
[04:02:44] The brain's ability to change itself, create new neural pathways, neuronal connections.
[04:02:50] You know, whatever it's doing in the brain as it relates to TBI is pretty remarkable.
[04:02:54] In our Stanford study, I think we'll prove that.
[04:02:57] The fourth thing is a spiritual connection or reconnection.
[04:03:03] And I think that that's what science will never be able to fully explain.
[04:03:07] That when someone feels as though they're put on this earth by a higher power and we're
[04:03:15] all connected and like, you know, we're all humans and we're alive and the grass is alive
[04:03:21] and the flowers are alive and the animals are alive and you see that you're part of
[04:03:24] this really incredible, huge ecosystem of purpose and perfection.
[04:03:30] You feel as though you have a place to belong again and you feel this God connection that
[04:03:39] I think is the answer to a lot of society's issues right now.
[04:03:45] So psychological, anti-addictive, physiological and spiritual.
[04:03:51] When you check all four of those boxes, you go home like, I feel pretty good.
[04:03:56] Now on the back end of this, there's a lot of things that are really important.
[04:04:01] So we're screening another one of our screening categories is like, how committed are you
[04:04:06] to this?
[04:04:07] Because we've got guys come into us that say, I don't know anything about this, my buddy
[04:04:10] said to do it.
[04:04:11] And then we've got guys that say, I've been researching this for a year and I've changed
[04:04:16] my diet and I'm really committed to working with a coach.
[04:04:20] Those of the guys are going to have the best chance for success.
[04:04:22] The spouse support is another huge factor in overall trajectory and success.
[04:04:28] So you know, it's every, the psychedelic just provides this massive reset.
[04:04:35] And then when you get someone like from fetal position to one knee, like they can stand
[04:04:41] up and take it from there, especially guys like you guys.
[04:04:45] So guys are leading these weeks with this checklist of now what?
[04:04:51] Cause now I feel great again.
[04:04:52] And so for Marcus and for hundreds of others at this point, you're feeling good and you're
[04:04:58] feeling like, you know, suddenly you've got a thousand pounds lifted off of you.
[04:05:01] You're sleeping better when you're sleeping better, you're getting up early and getting
[04:05:04] up early, you can work out now and you work out, you want to take supplements and you
[04:05:07] take supplements, you might as well eat, right?
[04:05:09] And it just becomes the sort of like self-propelling biohacking snowball effect in the very best
[04:05:19] ways.
[04:05:20] And those are the guys that are going, you know, through these remarkable changes.
[04:05:24] But for anyone that would think like, oh, you're just going to Mexico to do drugs.
[04:05:28] Uh-uh.
[04:05:29] No, no, no.
[04:05:30] People that are going down there are leaning into the hardest work of their lives and actually
[04:05:36] having to come face to face with things that they might have been running from for decades.
[04:05:44] She's being conservative about the Stanford study too, but it's the results are remarkable,
[04:05:51] like so remarkable that I think there's going to be a lot of eyes on it once they release
[04:05:56] it to the public Wednesday.
[04:05:58] No, no, no.
[04:05:59] No, no, no, no.
[04:06:00] It won't be published for quite some time.
[04:06:02] It won't be published, but we're going up there Wednesday just to, they're going to
[04:06:06] talk about the results officially, but not just from the reduction of symptoms, like
[04:06:11] what we were talking about earlier, but also the FMRIs that are coming out before and after
[04:06:18] are like astounding.
[04:06:19] It'll be groundbreaking.
[04:06:20] It won't just be groundbreaking for veterans.
[04:06:23] It'll be groundbreaking for contact sport athletes, for first responders.
[04:06:29] They're Alzheimer's patients, for Parkinson's patients.
[04:06:32] The changes in the brain on the physiological level, I hypothesize that there's not been
[04:06:40] anything like it to date.
[04:06:43] Marcus, when you, I'm dragging you back real quick.
[04:06:50] But give me an example of what you see, you said bloody gory.
[04:06:59] Number one, do you know that it's psychedelic?
[04:07:06] Or does it feel like it's a real thing?
[04:07:09] And like, give me just an example, just any example, just so people kind of can connect
[04:07:16] all these positive things to like what you see when you're on this journey.
[04:07:24] Yes.
[04:07:25] There you go.
[04:07:26] I tried hard not to use the word trip.
[04:07:28] I'm sure that's actually, we're trying not to call this thing trip.
[04:07:30] I picked that up.
[04:07:31] So it's funny.
[04:07:32] It's funny you say that because, you know, obviously we're around the whole kind of medical
[04:07:36] psychedelic community now and you hear all these things or how they correct people because,
[04:07:41] you know, a politician doesn't want to hear like drug.
[04:07:44] There's one here psychedelic, they immediately think of wood stock or, you know, right?
[04:07:48] So you know, we've been doing the same thing.
[04:07:50] Like we say this, we don't say that, you know, it all means the same thing.
[04:07:53] So I appreciate that.
[04:07:55] I'll make a very simple one and one that's not bloody or gory.
[04:08:01] My one of my close friends, his experience is he, he was sitting down and each individual
[04:08:11] from extortion was like dressed in white and would sit down and put their hand on his shoulder
[04:08:20] and say, Hey man, it's okay.
[04:08:22] Like I'm good.
[04:08:23] Like you can let me go now.
[04:08:25] But he had the conversation with that person and he would look at him and go, Yeah, okay.
[04:08:30] And then that guy would go and then another guy from extortion would sit down dressed
[04:08:35] in white and say, Hey man, I'm good.
[04:08:38] Like I'm good.
[04:08:39] I'm in a good place and then that person would go and each person that he was like, obviously
[04:08:45] having whatever this person was dealing with had to do with all the buddies he just lost
[04:08:52] on that Hilo.
[04:08:54] And once that was gone, again, he just dealt with whatever that was his trauma.
[04:09:01] It may have been locked back into subconscious as Amber mentioned, but that's what he was
[04:09:05] dealing with in life.
[04:09:08] And once he faced them and talked to them and they talked to him and they told him it
[04:09:12] was okay.
[04:09:14] He's okay.
[04:09:15] Like he's not bad anymore.
[04:09:16] Like he let he let that shit go.
[04:09:19] And I, you know, we hear these stories like over and over and over again and it's, you
[04:09:25] know, it's, it's they're all different, but they're all the same.
[04:09:28] And I think that's what's, you know, pretty remarkable about it.
[04:09:32] I've developed some of my own theories, whether they're true or not.
[04:09:36] I don't know every has theories as we're science hasn't proven my theories, but my theory is
[04:09:41] that whatever the trauma response is, it goes back to the origination of the trauma.
[04:09:48] And some people channel that trauma in ways that society deems unhealthy versus healthier.
[04:09:56] I feel like what I've seen in the special operations community is that is something in
[04:10:00] the early childhood has like enabled this sort of like dialing down of suffering.
[04:10:06] Like, like you just, the community is able to maintain such suffering.
[04:10:12] And so a lot of guys I've felt are going way back to childhood and dealing with like sort
[04:10:18] of repressed things.
[04:10:19] And I don't know, Marcus, if you want to tell any of her stories, like about your actual
[04:10:24] experience of going back to actual memories and childhood, but then also to your question
[04:10:28] jocco on why the blood in the gore, I also feel like when you're in the face of evil,
[04:10:35] they'll sort of can stick to you.
[04:10:38] And Marcus had to get through some really dark, very demonic, you know, heaviness to
[04:10:50] come out on the other side.
[04:10:52] And he's been back to do Ibogaine's sins.
[04:10:55] He's like basically does this annual protocol reset.
[04:10:57] Or like every year and a half.
[04:10:59] Yeah.
[04:11:00] And so if he started in the basement of his soul, every year he gets a floor higher.
[04:11:07] And the last time he did Ibogaine, which would be their fourth time, he described it as blissful.
[04:11:14] So yeah, so it wasn't, it wasn't painful.
[04:11:16] It wasn't tough.
[04:11:18] It wasn't angry.
[04:11:19] And I didn't feel like I was like, you know, fighting demons.
[04:11:22] You hear a lot of guys, I mean, they talk about literally like fighting demons.
[04:11:24] There's none of that.
[04:11:25] It was just kind of like peaceful and surreal and not tough.
[04:11:32] And what it told me is like, I'm good.
[04:11:35] Like I think I've scrubbed whatever I needed to scrub.
[04:11:39] You scrubbed the darkness.
[04:11:40] Yeah.
[04:11:41] You know, you kind of just got rid of any of the garbage that I think was, you know,
[04:11:46] affecting me.
[04:11:47] And so, I mean, I'm like, I'm light now.
[04:11:50] Like I don't have nightmares anymore.
[04:11:52] I mean, I think that was like a lot of the blood and gore or like, you know, you'd go
[04:11:56] to try to pull the trigger and like the magazine would fall out or like the barrel would melt.
[04:12:01] Like just all the dumb stuff.
[04:12:04] Like I don't have, I don't have those visions anymore.
[04:12:10] It is and some of it is funny.
[04:12:11] I mean, if you hear some of the stories, you're like, man, that's fucking hilarious.
[04:12:14] Right?
[04:12:15] Especially like team guys talking about their funny stories.
[04:12:17] I'm laughing because like everyone has that dream.
[04:12:19] They do.
[04:12:20] Like you're out of bullets.
[04:12:21] 100%.
[04:12:22] Like somebody 100 times and they're just like, look at you.
[04:12:24] Yeah.
[04:12:25] I'm sure you get more pissed off.
[04:12:26] You're like, wait a minute.
[04:12:27] I'm really good at fighting.
[04:12:29] Why can't I knock you out in my dream?
[04:12:31] Yeah, exactly.
[04:12:33] So we are trying to get this to as many veterans as we can.
[04:12:39] That's what you guys are working on right now.
[04:12:41] And you were telling me earlier, you're also looking to take this in a direction private
[04:12:48] as well.
[04:12:49] Yes.
[04:12:50] Like as a privately owned company.
[04:12:51] Yeah.
[04:12:52] So, as Amber was alluding to earlier, the amount of applications we get a day, those are just
[04:12:57] from veterans.
[04:12:58] The amount of individuals that reach out via Instagram or Facebook or really LinkedIn
[04:13:06] and LinkedIn is like a professional network.
[04:13:08] So a lot of corporate, a lot of CEOs and entrepreneurs just asking, hey, how do I do this?
[04:13:15] I heard you talk on so and so.
[04:13:17] Where do I go to find these treatments?
[04:13:20] And you introduced me to a coach or a therapist.
[04:13:23] And so the more that I saw over the last two years, I just said, Amber, when we started
[04:13:28] this, we said, hey, we want to help our teammates first, team guys, but we want to help all
[04:13:34] the special operations.
[04:13:35] And then we want to help all the veterans.
[04:13:37] And then we want to help athletes, like NFL players, at 99% of the brains they found autopsied
[04:13:46] from the individuals that have took their own life or all had CTE.
[04:13:52] We want to help those individuals.
[04:13:53] We said, you know what?
[04:13:55] We want to help anyone that is going through the same thing.
[04:13:58] And again, it's not everyone.
[04:14:00] It's just everyone that is struggling the same way.
[04:14:03] And that was kind of like my vision a long time ago is, I want to start with veterans
[04:14:07] and help our brothers and sisters, but I want to help everybody.
[04:14:12] And it took the interest of some VC that started donating to Vets and just said, hey, I really
[04:14:19] love what you're doing.
[04:14:20] Like I think this is needed.
[04:14:21] You know, I understand personalized medicine.
[04:14:25] How do we take this and introduce it to the broader population and reach more people?
[04:14:28] And I said, well, let's work on that.
[04:14:30] So I've been working on that for a year and we're actually launching this week.
[04:14:34] And the company's called Tara, T-A-R-A, Tara Mind.
[04:14:38] The website will be TaraMind.com.
[04:14:43] Right now we'll have a, we basically have a landing and info page for people to go to
[04:14:49] and just put in some information and they'll start getting some, you know, some newsletters
[04:14:54] and some info.
[04:14:56] But launching at the end of this year or it'll be, you know, the first couple of weeks of
[04:15:02] January, we're launching a care navigation and directory and basically a platform for
[04:15:14] psychedelic retreats, clinics, providers, coaches, basically a marketplace to connect
[04:15:23] all these individuals.
[04:15:24] And so the individuals that are reaching out to us on a regular basis and saying, hey,
[04:15:29] where do I go?
[04:15:30] What do I do?
[04:15:31] We're building that platform for them.
[04:15:32] And, you know, we're going to provide educational content.
[04:15:35] We're going to vet everything and have, you know, high standards and protocols that, you
[04:15:41] know, that these providers in the U.S. that are doing this right now, it's going to be
[04:15:47] ketamine, ketamine assisted psychotherapy because that's the only thing that's legal.
[04:15:52] So we're just, you know, the vision really is to build the largest platform in the world
[04:15:56] to connect all, you know, all the stakeholders.
[04:15:59] And eventually we will be collecting data on all these individuals and we will be going
[04:16:05] to insurers and making sure at the end of the day that they pay for these because right
[04:16:09] now not everybody can pay $6,000 to go outside the U.S. and do it.
[04:16:14] Right now it's like the top 1% can do it.
[04:16:16] Or if you're a nonprofit, you know, and you raise money for this, you know, then an individual
[04:16:21] can go.
[04:16:22] But again, we're supporting 200 people a year.
[04:16:25] How do you support 20 million?
[04:16:27] Insurance is going to have to pay for that.
[04:16:28] So the idea with TARA Mind is we collect, we connect all the stakeholders in psychedelic
[04:16:35] medicine and then eventually we go to insurers and show them the data and say, hey, this
[04:16:39] is working.
[04:16:40] You need to offer this up now as a benefit and pay for these individuals and subsidize
[04:16:44] these treatments.
[04:16:45] So.
[04:16:46] TARA Mind.
[04:16:47] TARA Mind, doc.
[04:16:48] TARA Mind.
[04:16:49] TARA is one of the highest, the most, I guess you want to call it, important deities in
[04:17:03] Buddhist and Hindu traditions and it's a goddess of, you know, of empathy and bringing people
[04:17:10] to the light and those in suffering to bring them to deliverance.
[04:17:14] So it's kind of a, kind of a, I thought a cool name, especially where it kind of, we
[04:17:21] came from and where we're going and what it's doing to people.
[04:17:24] So.
[04:17:25] And the URL was available.
[04:17:27] And the URL was available for I think $12 actually.
[04:17:30] Well, it sounds like like we're kind of up to date then, right?
[04:17:36] This thing is launching in a couple of days.
[04:17:38] We talked about vet solutions, vet solutions.org.
[04:17:43] You're on social media.
[04:17:45] You're on, you're at Marcus, you're at Marcus Capone.
[04:17:50] Then you guys have, am I right?
[04:17:52] Marcus underscore Amber underscore Capone.
[04:17:54] TARA Yeah.
[04:17:55] What's the deal with that?
[04:17:56] TARA I started that Instagram page.
[04:17:57] Oh, listen, we both like low the social media.
[04:18:01] So we're really not on it that much, but we definitely have help with our social media
[04:18:05] accounts because we want to make sure that we're providing information to others that
[04:18:10] are interested.
[04:18:11] Psychedelic therapies are poised to be the next major breakthrough in mental health care.
[04:18:16] So SSRIs were the last major breakthrough in mental health care 35 years ago.
[04:18:21] Yeah.
[04:18:22] And they're really, you know, for some they work, but you know, there is that warning
[04:18:28] label on the side of SSRI prescriptions that says this may trigger like an uptake, up increase
[04:18:36] in suicidal ideations.
[04:18:37] Well, why are we fighting better in suicide with anything linked to suicide?
[04:18:41] Like that's so asinine to me.
[04:18:42] So as veterans continue to drive this forward in the United States, I certainly feel like
[04:18:49] psychedelics are poised to come on on the scene a lot faster than maybe some had initially
[04:18:54] anticipated.
[04:18:55] Yeah.
[04:18:56] Especially with some of the conservative, you know, lawmakers that are coming out now,
[04:18:59] you know, Dan, you know, French Rose put a, you know, put through an amendment to provide
[04:19:04] funding not for veterans, but actually, and this was I think a complete surprise for everybody
[04:19:10] for active duty.
[04:19:11] So he thinks active duty should have access to this if they need it.
[04:19:15] And of course, you know, Governor Rick Perry, who's been in our corner from day one, you
[04:19:19] know, he helped us pass the bill in Texas.
[04:19:22] And he's just been a strong component or proponent of what we're doing.
[04:19:26] Again, because it's a tool that works, you know, that's all he cares about.
[04:19:29] That's it's really good to see the open mind of people realizing that this thing.
[04:19:34] And that's the same thing.
[04:19:35] I've seen, you know, I've had some good friends had Dakota Meyer come on here and like he actually
[04:19:40] he, I think, I think I talked about this on the podcast, but you know, he asked me like,
[04:19:46] Hey, do you think I should do something?
[04:19:47] Dude, I have no idea.
[04:19:49] So I called like Joe Rogan and Tim Ferriss.
[04:19:52] And I was like, Hey, you know, like, what do you guys think?
[04:19:54] They're like, I like this.
[04:19:56] They actually know they both were like, were thoughtful about it.
[04:20:01] And Joe had had Dakota on the podcast and he was like, he was like, Yeah, I think I
[04:20:09] like, I think it would be good for him.
[04:20:10] And I was like, cool.
[04:20:11] And I said, Hey, man, I'm in no position to recommend the stuff.
[04:20:14] But here's what I got from my friends that know more about the stuff.
[04:20:17] And you know, Tim Ferriss is really involved in, you know, the Johns Hopkins stuff that's
[04:20:22] going on.
[04:20:23] So I feel like at least I, you know, I'm never a person that claims to know anything.
[04:20:28] I don't know.
[04:20:29] I mean, I don't ever want to do that.
[04:20:32] But I talked to people that, you know, gave the best recommendation from their perspective,
[04:20:36] which, and, and he went down there and he did it and he said it was awesome, man.
[04:20:40] And it really helped them out a lot.
[04:20:42] And, and I mean, that guy's been through the freaking ringer, you know, just been through
[04:20:47] the ringer as, you know, losing his freaking team.
[04:20:50] And, man, and he came back in a much better spot.
[04:20:54] So when I see things like that, and then you have like a real conservative, like, you know,
[04:21:00] Rick Perry just like on board.
[04:21:04] That's just really cool to see.
[04:21:05] And Dan's obviously, you know, he's got friends that have done it.
[04:21:09] And for, you know, he's, he's taking it forward.
[04:21:12] So, yeah, I think it's true leadership.
[04:21:14] You know, that's what I say.
[04:21:15] Because again, I don't think I'm sure the state were exactly like I was like, this doesn't
[04:21:20] sound right.
[04:21:21] This is crazy.
[04:21:22] And then you do some research, you talk, really, you talk to friends and then you have like
[04:21:26] loved ones that you see have gotten better.
[04:21:30] It's the only decision to make.
[04:21:31] But again, to do it the right way.
[04:21:32] And I'm glad that you talk to people like Tim, you know, and Joe Rogan.
[04:21:36] And I'm glad they didn't just say, oh, yeah, go ahead and do it.
[04:21:38] Like they were like, well, let's, you know, and we've seen that with some of the retreats.
[04:21:42] Because again, we, we write grants for individuals seeking out these treatments.
[04:21:47] So we talked to a lot of vetted retreats and some, some have actually questioned like,
[04:21:52] well, wait a minute, it's a combat veteran.
[04:21:56] We're not, we're not so sure that we want to take that person because, you know, they
[04:21:59] got PTSD and we're not sure if they're going to flip out.
[04:22:02] And so, you know, we're, we're dealing with individuals are like, you know, worse to the
[04:22:07] worst in terms of, in terms of like trauma and, and some other things.
[04:22:12] And a lot of these other places are just used to dealing with some people are coming in
[04:22:14] with, I got some depression or, I mean, I have a little anxiety I want to deal with.
[04:22:18] So this should be definitely looked at and approached carefully.
[04:22:26] I got asked a question the other day about basically the guy was like, Hey, you know,
[04:22:30] I'm hanging out with these friends and they're drinking a lot and I'm not really drinking
[04:22:35] and they're smoking pot and you know, I'm not really smoking pot or when I do, I kind
[04:22:38] of like waste the weekend or waste the night.
[04:22:40] Like, what do you think?
[04:22:43] You know, how can I drink less and, you know, is it cool to drink sometimes and blah, blah,
[04:22:46] blah, blah, right?
[04:22:47] And I started kind of answering the question and I was, I just sort of said, I have seen
[04:22:53] enough people's lives ruined from drugs and alcohol that I actually at this juncture in
[04:23:00] my life, I can't even say like, Hey, dude, it's okay, you know, have a, I just can't
[04:23:04] do it.
[04:23:05] I can't do it anymore.
[04:23:06] I just, I've seen too many people's lives destroyed from drugs and alcohol.
[04:23:10] And so when, when I talk about this stuff, it's coming from someone that like is as far,
[04:23:16] I don't think I could be anymore.
[04:23:17] Well, I guess I could be a little bit more.
[04:23:19] I just think that drugs and alcohol are so bad for you and I've seen them ruin so many
[04:23:23] people's lives.
[04:23:24] I've seen them ruin freaking tea.
[04:23:25] How many team guys have you seen just like trash their lives with just alcohol?
[04:23:31] Can't count.
[04:23:32] It's, it's, it's ridiculous.
[04:23:33] And so I can't get behind it at all.
[04:23:36] And, and yet at the same time, I've had plenty of friends that have gone, they've done this.
[04:23:43] And what I like about what you guys are talking about, it's a hardcore screening.
[04:23:48] It's not like, Oh, you feel a little bad.
[04:23:50] Okay, let's just jump right into this.
[04:23:52] It's like, Hey, let's try some other protocols along the way and make sure that this is what
[04:23:58] you really need.
[04:23:59] And then I don't know if I want to use the term last resort, because I don't know if
[04:24:02] you consider it, guys consider it a last resort.
[04:24:04] But to me, it's like, Okay, I've tried this, I've tried that, I've tried something else.
[04:24:08] It's been too much time and I'm at a rock bottom and I need help.
[04:24:14] And this seems like, Okay, I need to get in there.
[04:24:17] Um, yeah, because, because from my perspective of seeing drugs and alcohol ruin so many people's
[04:24:22] lives that I just, I just can't get behind it.
[04:24:25] But you know, here you have something that people aren't getting like addicted to it.
[04:24:30] It's not, you know, it's not like the seven or whatever you said, nine freaking prescription
[04:24:35] prescription drugs.
[04:24:36] Hearing addictions.
[04:24:37] Yeah.
[04:24:38] Um, so appreciate, appreciate that side of it and not just throwing this at people just
[04:24:45] like, you know, no one should be thrown into situations like this.
[04:24:49] Um, you got to go through the proper screening and, and then go in the proper facility.
[04:24:53] Uh, you know, you guys are talking about like, you know, Fred the shaman from Wisconsin
[04:24:59] or whatever, you know, whatever this, like just going into random places and doing it
[04:25:03] or at a Slayer concert.
[04:25:04] It's not what we're talking about at all.
[04:25:06] Um, and like I said, it seems to have helped.
[04:25:10] I know it's helped.
[04:25:11] I know it's helped.
[04:25:12] I mean, obviously I'm sitting here in front of you and it helped you get back from the
[04:25:16] brink and I've got plenty of other friends have done the same thing.
[04:25:18] So, um, awesome to see this kind of progress.
[04:25:23] Probably a good place to wrap it up.
[04:25:24] Amber, you got anything else?
[04:25:25] No, I would just say, um, thank you for having us.
[04:25:29] Thank you for having an open mind.
[04:25:30] I know it's, you know, it's very nerve-wracking to public.
[04:25:34] I'm scared of it.
[04:25:35] By the way, I'm sorry for, I'm scared.
[04:25:37] Like I, I don't want to do anything to my brain.
[04:25:39] I don't want to like, I'm scared of it.
[04:25:41] I'm scared of, uh, maybe it's like that weird like control thing where I don't want to,
[04:25:46] but like I'm scared.
[04:25:48] What I'm scared of is like, I don't want to mess anything up.
[04:25:50] I don't want to, I don't want to like, I feel, I feel like of a better word, bro.
[04:25:53] I feel fine.
[04:25:54] You know, so I feel fine.
[04:25:55] So I'm always like, oh man, I don't want to do that because it makes me scared, uh,
[04:26:00] to mess something up.
[04:26:02] But that's cause I feel pretty, I feel pretty good right now.
[04:26:05] So I think that, um, my fear of it is a healthy fear and, uh, but I think that's good though.
[04:26:13] Like I think when you approach, you know, anything with that could be risky, like you
[04:26:19] should approach it with some fear or respect.
[04:26:22] I guess you want to say, yeah, you know, I mean, it's like the first time when we were
[04:26:25] playing with, you know, demo and some other stuff or you're like, ah, you know, I've been
[04:26:29] throwing a hundred grenades, you know, or a thousand grenades, like nothing can happen.
[04:26:32] But like actually something really can happen, but you approach it with respect and you take
[04:26:36] care and you make sure you, you tape them correctly and you know, you, you know, you
[04:26:40] don't pull the, you know, drop this, you know, drop the grenade, throw the spoon or whatever.
[04:26:45] Um, you know, same, same thing with these medicines, you know, approach them with care,
[04:26:49] only do if me, if you need to, if you feel fine and you're good, like, why?
[04:26:54] Um, I've never done a psychedelic.
[04:26:58] No, I haven't either.
[04:26:59] No.
[04:27:00] And I don't feel called to do it.
[04:27:01] You know, whatever you know, you know, you know, and, um, I will say that I've seen it.
[04:27:07] I've seen these medicines change the lives, like not just help, but literally change the
[04:27:14] lives, be them, be of the difference between life and death for countless operators.
[04:27:20] And, um, for a lot of spouses as well, and there's a lot of trauma to heal.
[04:27:24] I used to catch more, because looking out the window with like this thousand yard stare,
[04:27:28] and I would say, like, please help me understand what's going on in your head.
[04:27:31] What are you thinking about right now?
[04:27:33] And he would say, how much better off you would be without me here?
[04:27:36] How much easier your, your life would be in the kids lives would be without me here.
[04:27:40] And so I feel like anytime you walk up to that line, you have to have an open mind of
[04:27:45] like whatever works.
[04:27:48] I have totally changed the way I think about what I have been told is a drug versus a drug.
[04:27:58] This is a plant.
[04:27:59] Like my faith is so important to me.
[04:28:01] And I feel like God has given us everything that we need on earth.
[04:28:04] A lot of these medicines, most of them originate from plants.
[04:28:08] So I had to really like check myself.
[04:28:11] And I have thought that something made by man in a laboratory that's prescribed by a
[04:28:15] doctor in a lab coat is what is the cure.
[04:28:21] And a plant is a drug.
[04:28:23] And I've almost like flip flopped that.
[04:28:26] And I feel like so many of these answers are found in nature and found within us.
[04:28:30] And so I've just seen replicated time after time again, you give someone this opportunity
[04:28:34] with something that's God given and totally unadultered.
[04:28:40] And you create this reset and connection and like, Oh, they're good.
[04:28:45] They're good as opposed to like putting a bandaid after bandaid after bandaid.
[04:28:49] The US government is big farmers, number one customer.
[04:28:52] And so, you know, getting people off of that cycle, this carousel of pharmaceuticals is
[04:29:00] just unintended byproduct of what we're doing.
[04:29:03] But man, we are seeing guys and gals really start to live again.
[04:29:08] Oh, yeah.
[04:29:09] I didn't mention that, Jaco.
[04:29:10] So I was on those, all those anti depressants and whatever through November 11, 2017, when
[04:29:16] I went down for treatment.
[04:29:18] I haven't touched a prescription since not anything.
[04:29:23] So it's pretty remarkable.
[04:29:26] And again, my story is like one of hundreds.
[04:29:28] I'm not, you know, I'm not the only one, which is nice.
[04:29:31] Good to get rid of all those nasties.
[04:29:34] The only other thing that I want to add really quickly is another unintended byproduct of
[04:29:40] our work is that we've seen this incredible reunification.
[04:29:46] Just this is a topic that everyone can generally agree upon as veteran health care.
[04:29:51] And so we're seeing both sides of the aisle like actually come together, actually want
[04:29:54] to work together, actually like one another again.
[04:29:59] And so I hope that that ripple out effect continues across our nation.
[04:30:05] I feel like we need healing now more than ever.
[04:30:09] And it's pretty surreal what's happening.
[04:30:12] It's an honor.
[04:30:14] Marcus, any closing thoughts?
[04:30:16] No, just, you know, first off, thank you for having us on here.
[04:30:23] I know this was a different topic for you.
[04:30:28] And again, trust me, this was nothing I ever intended out to even think about getting involved
[04:30:34] in.
[04:30:35] But I just, I see the power in it.
[04:30:39] You know, and to approach these medicines carefully, they're not to be used at the Slayer
[04:30:48] concert.
[04:30:49] I think the way we're going about it is the right way.
[04:30:51] I think the way that these are going to be introduced to the public is going to be done
[04:30:58] correctly.
[04:30:59] I think it's going to be a really medically driven industry.
[04:31:03] At least first, you know, if it goes other routes, you know, it's not what we're here,
[04:31:07] what we're talking about.
[04:31:08] And so I, you know, I want to just tell people that if they're interested, you know, and
[04:31:15] they're searching, make sure they do their research, make sure to find vetted providers
[04:31:20] that have been doing this for a long time that know what they're doing.
[04:31:24] Make sure they have a coach, a therapist that understands how these medicines work.
[04:31:31] And again, you know, it's why we built vets.
[04:31:33] It's why I'm building TARM Mind.
[04:31:36] Again, it's to provide access and affordability for people.
[04:31:39] And so last thing, you know, I'll say is that there's hope.
[04:31:45] So if you're, you know, if you're out there and you're thinking that there's nothing
[04:31:49] ahead of you, there's no purpose, you know, why are you here?
[04:31:53] I promise that that is a, that's a temporary thought.
[04:31:58] And 100%, you can climb out of that.
[04:32:00] And once you do, you'll see how cool life can be and to get back to your old self or
[04:32:05] maybe invent a new better, better person.
[04:32:08] We are living our best life.
[04:32:10] We really are.
[04:32:11] And it is such an incredible blessing.
[04:32:13] I just have to pinch myself every day that this is actually happening.
[04:32:20] Marcus always says I have to get in the final word, which is there's some accuracy to that.
[04:32:25] Less word, less word.
[04:32:26] When something else that I just thought of when you said that is that, you know, part
[04:32:30] of what we're doing to reverse these stigmas, especially around asking for help is adopting
[04:32:39] more of a mindset that really, really true strength is vulnerability.
[04:32:45] I think that our society would say the opposite, but it takes a lot of courage to be vulnerable.
[04:32:52] And we're seeing that day in and day out of that.
[04:32:55] Yeah.
[04:32:56] If someone, I'm going to get the last word in there.
[04:32:58] Someone thinks we like coming up here and talking about like all this shit that's gone
[04:33:02] on and think we enjoy this spotlight is fucking crazy because we don't at all, but we definitely
[04:33:11] feel it's necessary.
[04:33:12] So like now I don't even think it's about us.
[04:33:14] I think it's just like this needs to be done.
[04:33:17] Well, I mean, thank you.
[04:33:20] Thank you for both of you stepping into the spotlight.
[04:33:23] And I know it's a bright spotlight and I know it's a burning spotlight in many cases.
[04:33:29] You know, when you talk about being at Chad's funeral and just knowing that you had to do
[04:33:35] something and you had at least an answer for a lot of people.
[04:33:42] So thank you so much for joining us.
[04:33:47] Thanks for your service.
[04:33:49] And yeah, Marcus, thanks for your service and the teams and for signing the dotted line
[04:33:54] and risking life in limb.
[04:33:56] And you know, Amber, I don't get the chance.
[04:33:58] My wife has always said like she's my wife has zero percent chance of coming on this
[04:34:02] podcast.
[04:34:03] She doesn't like to talk to anybody.
[04:34:05] But for you, for all the wives, for all the spouses that, you know, you didn't put your
[04:34:12] name on that line, but you put your name on that dotted line and what the wives and spouses
[04:34:18] and families and your kids, what they go through is so harsh.
[04:34:26] And yet you you're there and you supported and you continue to support and now you're
[04:34:31] supporting all the families out there and all the veterans.
[04:34:34] So thanks for what you have done in the past.
[04:34:38] Thanks for what you're continuing to do as you help veterans get out of the darkness
[04:34:46] and move toward light and life.
[04:34:53] Thanks for what you're doing.
[04:34:54] Thank you.
[04:34:55] Thanks, Chaco.
[04:34:56] It's been awesome.
[04:34:57] Thank you.
[04:34:58] With that, Marcus and Amber have left the building.
[04:35:03] So pretty dynamic story of change and a journey that they've been through for sure.
[04:35:15] Would you you were sitting in the corner, you were so you were off camera on that one.
[04:35:19] Echo Charles.
[04:35:20] What do you think?
[04:35:21] Good evening, Echo, by the way.
[04:35:22] Good evening.
[04:35:23] Very interesting.
[04:35:24] It was funny.
[04:35:25] Even from the beginning, I was relating a lot because like both our birthday, he's one
[04:35:28] year older than me.
[04:35:30] Both our birthdays in December.
[04:35:31] So we entered college later or we were late, you know, and entered college, played football.
[04:35:39] And even and how's this as far as the was it you know him.
[04:35:43] He was saying about alcohol, right?
[04:35:47] Like, oh, how's this going to affect me?
[04:35:48] Like how can it, you know, you thought that way too.
[04:35:51] Yeah, with alcohol.
[04:35:52] I was like, I'd always asked my friends like, because I didn't start drinking till I was
[04:35:55] like, 2021.
[04:35:56] And so I would always ask like, hey, like, can you tell that you're drunk or can you
[04:36:01] tell that you're buzzing or are you just buzzing then afterwards you remember, oh, I was buzzing
[04:36:05] or, you know, can you tell?
[04:36:06] Like, what does it feel like kind of a thing?
[04:36:08] I remember relating very deeply with that small, tiny part.
[04:36:14] Also you're the one who said Andy Stumpf might be one of the bigger wiseasses.
[04:36:20] He's I'll go in or I could say he's the biggest.
[04:36:22] Oh, that was one of the most.
[04:36:23] That was one of the most.
[04:36:24] He's the number one biggest wise out.
[04:36:27] Yes, fully.
[04:36:29] What up?
[04:36:31] You were talking about you think your mind is more of a serious one.
[04:36:35] So you know, you're you were saying your mind is like, you feel okay.
[04:36:38] So like, you're kind of, would you say scared to take psychedelics?
[04:36:41] What if it jams you up?
[04:36:43] Right?
[04:36:44] Like, what if he did take it and it like made you, because you know how like some people
[04:36:48] they're so driven, but because of like something that's kind of off in their mind, I feel like
[04:36:52] that's kind of you in real life.
[04:36:54] Yeah, like there's something probably significantly like off with you, but it's sort of like just
[04:37:00] by happenstance like works for you, you know, some people are like that.
[04:37:05] So what if you took psychedelics and then like now you're like, you kind of you're kind
[04:37:09] of like more lazy or like you don't work as hard anymore.
[04:37:12] I don't like that idea.
[04:37:14] So I've even had people say like, oh, you know, you should, hey man, you know, you should
[04:37:17] smoke pot.
[04:37:19] And I'd be like, well, why be like, oh, because it kind of take your edge off.
[04:37:22] And I was like, why would I want to take my edge off?
[04:37:25] I want to sharpen it.
[04:37:27] I want to be.
[04:37:29] You're going to start sending like, like Christmas cards now and giving gifts.
[04:37:34] Like, you know, like you need to do all that kind of stuff.
[04:37:35] That's what I think.
[04:37:36] I think you're going to be like, man, I've been, I've neglected the emotional elements
[04:37:41] of friendships of my life for so long.
[04:37:44] You're going to get the Christmas card.
[04:37:46] I sent you.
[04:37:47] Yeah, that's what I think would happen to you.
[04:37:49] That's what I think.
[04:37:50] Or you're going to like start really valuing your rest days.
[04:37:53] You know, you're going to start scheduling like two solid rest days.
[04:37:57] You're going to start exercising moderation in a bunch of things because it's better
[04:38:01] for you like all this stuff.
[04:38:02] It's going to change fundamentally.
[04:38:03] I wouldn't count on anything that you're saying, but to the serious point of what you're
[04:38:07] saying, like it does.
[04:38:11] That kind of makes the like even just where our joking is like a legitimate concern.
[04:38:16] I wouldn't want that.
[04:38:18] I wouldn't want to be like quote more mellow.
[04:38:24] And the other thing is you got to remember is we, you know, we do.
[04:38:27] I mean, it's not like I'm walking around freaking, you know, like I go home, play guitar or
[04:38:33] whatever, watch the sunset.
[04:38:34] It's not, you know what I mean?
[04:38:35] Like that's normal stuff.
[04:38:36] Yeah.
[04:38:37] Fully.
[04:38:38] What was it?
[04:38:39] You watched Robocop too.
[04:38:41] Not sure.
[04:38:42] So Robocop too.
[04:38:43] He's so, you know, Robocop, he's kind of like you.
[04:38:45] He's hardcore.
[04:38:46] It just goes hard.
[04:38:47] Drop your weapons or there will be trouble.
[04:38:50] Yes.
[04:38:51] Exactly.
[04:38:52] So in part two, they're like, Hey, the Robocops for, you know, he does this, whatever he does.
[04:38:57] And then they're like, Hey, he's getting like giving us a bad image.
[04:39:01] I think like some other company came in or something like that.
[04:39:04] And she was like, Hey, let's make them like more appealing, you know, more and more friendly
[04:39:08] to the public and stuff.
[04:39:09] And they write all these directives and like it jams him up.
[04:39:12] That's gonna be you, bro.
[04:39:13] Because they're right.
[04:39:14] But in theory, they're right.
[04:39:16] You know, how did it cause problems?
[04:39:18] Like he wouldn't solve crimes anymore.
[04:39:20] He'd start saying poems and stuff and like some dumb stuff that doesn't really match
[04:39:25] his thing.
[04:39:26] You know, it was like that.
[04:39:27] You got to watch it to kind of see.
[04:39:28] But anyway, that'd be you.
[04:39:29] So yes, I am not down with messing with what I've got going on right now.
[04:39:37] And so, but like I said, 10 times, I think I said it 48 times, but knowing a lot of guys
[04:39:43] that have gone through this kind of thing and just talking to Marcus, man, you know,
[04:39:47] when he's like, I said to him on the podcast, I'm like, dude, it's hard to even imagine
[04:39:52] him getting like mad or, you know, throwing a coffee cup through a window or what, you
[04:39:57] know, like this guy, he's, he's chill.
[04:40:00] He's mellow.
[04:40:01] He's and yet he's still doing great stuff.
[04:40:02] He's not like he's not getting after it.
[04:40:04] He's still in good shape.
[04:40:05] You know, he's still, he's got businesses going to him.
[04:40:07] He's 100% on, on, on track on a bunch of different levels.
[04:40:11] So, you know, and this, this stuff really helped him out.
[04:40:14] So I'm down.
[04:40:16] I'm down for, if it helps people out for sure.
[04:40:20] I do think it should be like a last resort scenario.
[04:40:22] Look, not so close to the edge that the edge is a threat, but you know, try some other
[04:40:27] things out, make sure you, you know, make sure your diet's clean.
[04:40:30] Make sure you're not drinking every night and expecting things to be good in life.
[04:40:34] If you're drinking every night, you can't expect things to be good in life.
[04:40:37] Yeah.
[04:40:38] I'm not saying you're going to have a bad life, but there's a chance you are.
[04:40:41] So clean up the diet, get off the alcohol.
[04:40:45] I can't give any advice about the, all the, all the prescription drugs, but you know,
[04:40:52] maybe talk to your doctor about how you could get off.
[04:40:54] So I don't know, man.
[04:40:56] He was sitting downstairs and he made a really good point where, um, cause some people, they
[04:41:02] like, you know how you say, and I get it cause it can seem like this, but some people are
[04:41:07] most people with a problem with drinking.
[04:41:09] They can't just stop drinking.
[04:41:11] Like there's just, I'm not saying they can't.
[04:41:13] I'm just saying there's a lot more to it than just, oh yeah, just stop drinking.
[04:41:15] You know?
[04:41:16] So for sure.
[04:41:17] So he was like, we're downstairs talking right after, right after.
[04:41:21] So he, he said, you can't tell someone who's in the basement.
[04:41:25] He can't tell him, Hey, go on, just go exercise.
[04:41:28] Oh, just go on the mat.
[04:41:29] You know what?
[04:41:30] That's kind of hard to do even for a normal person.
[04:41:33] So you can't tell someone who's in the basement just to, just to do that.
[04:41:36] Cause that's hard.
[04:41:37] He's like, let's get them out of the basement first.
[04:41:40] So he's safe.
[04:41:41] They're out of the basement.
[04:41:42] Then we can start introducing them to the mats, to more exercise, to all the, this other
[04:41:47] stuff that's going to take more work by the way.
[04:41:50] So you love Jiu Jitsu.
[04:41:51] I'm sure working out has been a part of your life for a very long time.
[04:41:54] So it's second nature.
[04:41:55] You know, but for a lot of people, especially if they're not into working out, you're saying
[04:42:00] you want them to work out for an hour a day.
[04:42:04] Pretty much every day.
[04:42:06] Like that, you know, working out freaking hard.
[04:42:08] Yeah.
[04:42:09] Well, the other key component of what you're saying is, I mean, if you remember, I, I like
[04:42:14] tried to nail down Marcus a bunch of times about like, what did you feel?
[04:42:18] And what he felt was not like not doing anything, like not motivated to do things.
[04:42:25] So that, what you're talking about, the, the basement, like getting someone to like, I
[04:42:32] think, oh, get him to work out.
[04:42:34] What does that mean?
[04:42:35] What does that mean?
[04:42:36] She just get up and you work out.
[04:42:37] Like to me, it's this normal thing.
[04:42:38] But for a lot of people, that might be a big step.
[04:42:40] Now, listen, it could be a smaller step if you put your mind to it, you know, it's going
[04:42:43] to help you and maybe you get the rewards for it.
[04:42:45] You commit to doing it for a certain amount of time.
[04:42:47] It's like the, we were just talking to a kid in the locker room.
[04:42:49] He goes, I just submitted someone for the first time in three years.
[04:42:52] He's been training for three years.
[04:42:54] Got his first submission, bro.
[04:42:56] So remember that was one of the, one of the things I said when someone said, Hey, I really
[04:43:01] don't like you.
[04:43:02] Did you do how long should I train for?
[04:43:03] And I was like, train until you submit to, train until you submit to someone.
[04:43:08] Same thing with like working out, like workout until like there should be some thing that
[04:43:14] you have to do.
[04:43:15] Like, can you do a pull up?
[04:43:16] If you can't do a pull up or workout until you can do a pull up.
[04:43:19] If you can't, you know, run a mile in less than seven minutes, workout until you can
[04:43:28] run a mile in less than seven minutes.
[04:43:29] So I'm just saying, I don't, those aren't the correct answers, but I'm saying something
[04:43:32] along those lines because there's no, if you're not feeling the short term reward, because
[04:43:38] let's face it, you and me, we get a short term reward from working out just cause we
[04:43:43] kind of know how it's going to feel later and we know the longterm health benefits.
[04:43:47] So even a single workout feels good to me because I know the longterm benefits and I
[04:43:54] know the, I know even the short term benefits.
[04:43:57] So it feels good.
[04:43:59] But if it doesn't feel good to someone and you don't know about the longterm rewards,
[04:44:02] you don't see that strategic thing.
[04:44:04] It just wasn't fun.
[04:44:05] Yeah.
[04:44:06] Just another thing they're going to avoid.
[04:44:07] Yeah.
[04:44:08] Just wasn't fun.
[04:44:09] So yeah.
[04:44:10] He said, he said, he mentioned something to brew briefly, but there's so much to it
[04:44:14] where he said, I forget exactly the full context, but he said, get your heart rate up and it's
[04:44:19] like better than most medicine.
[04:44:20] Yeah.
[04:44:21] He said something along those lines.
[04:44:22] I'm like, man, that's true.
[04:44:23] And I used to tell you about this.
[04:44:25] Like remember when I was like kind of down for drinking every day or whatever?
[04:44:29] It was like years ago.
[04:44:31] And sometimes you enter in this funk, you know, and I was still working out and like
[04:44:36] doing everything, but it's just a fun, you just have a funky day the next day, like
[04:44:39] you're dragging and sometimes it would go all the way into your mind where I would have
[04:44:43] these real low level mundane feelings of what kind of what he was talking about where it's
[04:44:48] like, why bother?
[04:44:49] Like, why do I even care about this?
[04:44:51] What?
[04:44:52] Jiu-Jitsu?
[04:44:53] Like who cares?
[04:44:54] Like what?
[04:44:55] That's the path that I went down during that conversation of like when death, when you're
[04:45:00] confronted with death and then the world moves on and you're like, well, we're all going
[04:45:09] to end up in the same spot anyway.
[04:45:10] So really kind of what's the point, right?
[04:45:13] And I think that's the place where you could lose like lose the motivation to do really
[04:45:20] anything because I'm thinking, dude, we're all going to end up in the grave anyways.
[04:45:25] So whatever.
[04:45:27] And that's a horrible place to be because you forget about all the things, all the beautiful
[04:45:31] things that are in life.
[04:45:32] I was listening to Jordan Peterson the other day.
[04:45:35] You know, Jordan Peterson goes off on the like, you know, life is suffering and it's
[04:45:41] going to be a nightmare and it's a misery and like, which I get.
[04:45:46] And you know, it's even, it's not just him saying it's like religion is like all the
[04:45:49] religions are like life is suffering and the Buddha is like, oh, it's suffering and I
[04:45:55] get it.
[04:45:56] I get it.
[04:45:58] But man, there's a lot of things in life that are really kind of fun and cool.
[04:46:03] And look, you're going to have, I think the point of Jordan Peterson is you look, you're
[04:46:11] going to have suffering, right?
[04:46:13] You're going to have suffering.
[04:46:14] That's what's going to happen at some point, right?
[04:46:16] People are going to get sick.
[04:46:17] People are going to die.
[04:46:18] Things are going to go right.
[04:46:19] You're going to get fired.
[04:46:20] You're going to, your business is going to fail.
[04:46:21] Like all those things are going to happen, right?
[04:46:22] So, but to just blanket say because of that life is I'm going to, I'm not just going to
[04:46:30] go into Jordan and Peter and I'm going against a Buddha who they say life is suffering.
[04:46:35] I'm going to say, you know what?
[04:46:36] There's suffering in life, but life is not suffering.
[04:46:38] There's a lot of cool stuff that happens.
[04:46:40] There's a lot of funny stuff that happens.
[04:46:42] You make friends.
[04:46:43] You say some funny stuff.
[04:46:44] Y'all laugh.
[04:46:45] You've been sitting around laughing so hard that it's just, you can't even, it like hurts
[04:46:49] your stomach.
[04:46:50] Have you ever had that happen?
[04:46:51] Yes, sir.
[04:46:52] It's real.
[04:46:53] Come on, man.
[04:46:54] Is that suffering now?
[04:46:55] No.
[04:46:56] No, it's not.
[04:46:57] So let's not take it to the extreme of life is suffering.
[04:46:59] There's suffering in life and I get that and we're 100% agreement on that.
[04:47:03] Who was it?
[04:47:04] I think Hemingway said, I think Hemingway said, if two people love each other, there
[04:47:13] can be no happy ending, which is true, right?
[04:47:19] You know what I'm saying?
[04:47:20] I mean, because someone's going to die.
[04:47:21] Someone's going to die.
[04:47:22] And at some point that other person's going to be sitting there crying because they lost
[04:47:25] that person.
[04:47:26] Yeah.
[04:47:27] But that being said, live a happy life.
[04:47:29] You take care of each other, whatever.
[04:47:31] You have family.
[04:47:33] You have grandchildren.
[04:47:36] Hey, maybe that is a little bit of a happy ending.
[04:47:40] You know what I'm saying?
[04:47:41] Yeah.
[04:47:42] So I don't know.
[04:47:43] I think we're leaning a little bit far into suffering right now.
[04:47:45] And look, I get it.
[04:47:47] I get it, man.
[04:47:51] Your heart is going to get broken.
[04:47:53] And I'm not just talking about, oh, I'm in a relationship.
[04:47:56] I'm talking your friends die.
[04:47:57] Your heart's going to be broken.
[04:47:59] It's going to hurt.
[04:48:02] But that's not everything.
[04:48:05] So and I think, you know, from what, from what Marcus is saying, you know, some of that
[04:48:11] visibility of the good stuff comes by dealing with that other stuff.
[04:48:19] And that's another thing for me.
[04:48:23] And I talk about this in discipline, freedom, field manual a little bit.
[04:48:26] But I think, you know, I've lost friends and I've talked about it.
[04:48:34] And straight up giving eulogies for my guys.
[04:48:40] Like immediately as soon as they die, you're basically like writing about what you thought
[04:48:46] about them and how you felt about them and what they meant to you and how awesome they
[04:48:49] were.
[04:48:50] Like that is so therapeutic.
[04:48:52] Even though I was doing it as my duty, it also I recognize that it was a therapeutic thing.
[04:48:57] I recognize later in life that, oh, like how did I get through that?
[04:49:00] Oh, yeah, I wrote about them.
[04:49:01] And when you write about them, you detach from it.
[04:49:03] When you detach from it, you get to read and you get to think and you get to think through
[04:49:06] it and you get to process.
[04:49:07] And all those things happen by writing about, you know, your friend, your hero, this person,
[04:49:13] this individual that made this sacrifice.
[04:49:15] And it's a way of processing this stuff that I think, you know, the term that Marcus used
[04:49:22] was, you know, you got to, the only way to get, to get over this stuff is to go through
[04:49:28] it.
[04:49:29] Right.
[04:49:30] And that's sort of like you do when you write a eulogy or you write a letter to someone that's
[04:49:33] passed or you talk to their parents about them, you talk to their, their siblings about
[04:49:39] them.
[04:49:40] And that is so, such a good way to help move through the pain that you're going to feel.
[04:49:47] And you're going to feel pain.
[04:49:48] You're going to suffer, but life is not suffering.
[04:49:53] There's much more to it and a lot of it's good.
[04:49:57] So yeah, I heard that everyone that I know that went through psychedelic journey, all
[04:50:04] the way, even like some people, some people I do, isn't the official one.
[04:50:07] It just takes some mushrooms, but they do it with intention.
[04:50:11] It's all worked for them.
[04:50:12] Like I know people who quit drinking.
[04:50:15] It's weird, but the, the two people I know who quit drinking was real surprising too,
[04:50:20] but slowly by slowly like it came back and then they started drinking again, not just
[04:50:25] all of a sudden they didn't just be like, okay, that was fine.
[04:50:26] And now I'm drinking again.
[04:50:27] It would be like, you know, six months later, they'll be like, I'll just have one.
[04:50:32] And then it just slowly creeps back in, which actually went in line with what he was saying,
[04:50:36] or it's like, Hey, it's not just a magic pill one time.
[04:50:38] It's kind of like, it's kind of like a, it's like a therapy almost kind of a thing.
[04:50:42] Cause it's like, I guess it like rewires your, the way I always saw it was like all year,
[04:50:47] the way you regard it, the way you create meaning or whatever it has to do with like
[04:50:50] all your past experiences mixed with how you're, you know, you're genetics or whatever.
[04:50:54] So all your past experiences, ups down trauma, no trauma is like everything kind of creates
[04:50:59] little meanings with every little interaction.
[04:51:03] So if those meanings that you created in your head are all jammed up, or even if they're,
[04:51:08] I don't know, maybe they're, everyone's going to have different meanings for different things.
[04:51:11] So what it does is it goes back to those original like meanings that you're making and it just
[04:51:17] jumbles them all up and kind of, so you can kind of detach from the way they were formed.
[04:51:23] So it kind of like, oh, so you can make your, and he made a good analogy with the snow.
[04:51:27] So it's like, you can make your own tracks, be careful though.
[04:51:29] But yeah, the tracks you make could be wrong.
[04:51:31] Oh yeah, because, and because some people, they'll just take it recreationally and they'll
[04:51:35] be like, oh yeah, it was just a trip and it opened my eyes, but they don't really get
[04:51:38] any intended like positive outcome.
[04:51:39] They just, oh, I just want to, as my little brother's wife said, some people just want
[04:51:44] to take mushrooms to fry.
[04:51:46] And they'll recommend this.
[04:51:49] No, no, one time Jade was getting all deep in the, you know, one night and he's like,
[04:51:55] yeah, you know, he's taking mushrooms and do all this stuff.
[04:51:57] And she's like, why you got to try to be all intellectual about it?
[04:51:59] Why can't you just admit some people just take mushrooms to fry?
[04:52:03] But yeah, that's a different thing.
[04:52:08] I'm saying, yeah.
[04:52:09] All right.
[04:52:10] Well, if you want to support this podcast, get some jocofuel, get some jocofuel.

[04:52:29] I guess I taste it.
[04:52:30] Pink lemonade.
[04:52:31] Oh yeah, good.
[04:52:32] But we already knew that kind of a thing.
[04:52:33] It's not like mango or I'm like, oh, this is freaking mango.
[04:52:36] Let's see.
[04:52:37] Look, if you go, you have a fruit bowl and you might be different, but this is just me.
[04:52:41] I got a grapefruit.
[04:52:44] I got orange.
[04:52:45] Yep.
[04:52:46] And I got a mango.
[04:52:47] You're going mango, huh?
[04:52:48] I will eat the orange and I'll be like, cool.
[04:52:50] I'll have a grapefruit or pink lemonade or whatever, or lemon, whatever.
[04:52:53] Good.
[04:52:54] Fine.
[04:52:55] But bro, come on.
[04:52:56] A mango.
[04:52:57] Mangoes just taste better to me.
[04:52:58] Okay.
[04:52:59] Mango juice.

[04:53:09] A lot of people, and you know what I mean by a lot of people, a lot of people are saying
[04:53:13] that that might be the one.
[04:53:15] You also got the new Dax avage, which is ridiculous.
[04:53:18] So basically everybody.
[04:53:19] So like, okay, so a wise man named Kate Knuts once said, he's all, everybody's showing up.
[04:53:26] So in your case, everyone.
[04:53:27] He's like, you, me, everybody.

[04:53:36] We got the ready to drink more, which is, I'm telling you what, I got problems with ready
[04:53:40] to drink more because I'm drinking it way, it's way too easy.
[04:53:43] Too easy.
[04:53:44] It's too easy.
[04:53:45] Like boom.
[04:53:46] But you know what's nice?
[04:53:47] It's just like a little 30 gram protein hitter, which is an unbelievably convenient and
[04:53:52] joyous thing in life.
[04:53:54] It's just to be like, you know what, and it tastes freaking good.
[04:53:58] Pete's son Keegan, cause I don't like vanilla.
[04:54:00] You know, I don't like vanilla.
[04:54:01] Right.
[04:54:02] It's not my jam.
[04:54:03] It's real vanilla.
[04:54:06] But so I was drinking banana.
[04:54:07] I was drinking chocolate and that camp Pete's son Keegan.
[04:54:11] He's like, it tastes like melted vanilla ice cream.
[04:54:14] And I kind of didn't believe him cause let's face it, even people that don't like vanilla,
[04:54:19] melted vanilla ice cream is hella good.
[04:54:21] Right.
[04:54:22] You know what I'm saying.
[04:54:23] You're right.
[04:54:24] It's 100% accurate.
[04:54:25] You're correct.
[04:54:26] 100% accurate.
[04:54:27] So I said to myself, there's no way this tastes like melted vanilla ice cream cause then
[04:54:31] it would be hella good.
[04:54:33] And sure enough, I cracked it open.
[04:54:36] It tastes like melted vanilla ice cream.
[04:54:38] It's legitimate.

[04:56:03] Actually two weeks ago.
[04:56:04] Yeah, for real.
[04:56:05] They have no purpose in life.
[04:56:06] No purpose.
[04:56:07] Those old geese, we apologize to the receivers of these geese, but at least if they can
[04:56:12] get them started, then they can become a world champion and get a good gear.

[04:56:25] Send out email to everybody.
[04:56:27] The standard issue, discipline equals freedom.
[04:56:30] So it's the kind where if you don't have the standard issue, are you even really represented?
[04:56:37] I know the answer is probably yes.
[04:56:39] That's a big pressure scenario.
[04:56:40] I know.
[04:56:41] I know.
[04:56:42] I know.
[04:56:43] The answer is probably yes.
[04:56:44] You sure you want to do it like that?
[04:56:45] No.
[04:56:46] I'm not sure I want to do it like that.
[04:56:47] But-
[04:56:48] What if a dude is just getting after in seven different fronts and you not got a standard
[04:56:51] issue, you're like, hey, you're not really represented?
[04:56:52] I know.
[04:56:53] Do I even have to?
[04:56:54] You're right.
[04:56:55] You're right.
[04:56:56] And look, hey, look, I'm still hypothesizing.
[04:56:57] For judgmental people, you might not be representing.
[04:57:03] Or just check it out.
[04:57:04] I think that statement actually might piss some people off.
[04:57:05] I kind of got a little bit pissed when you just said it.
[04:57:08] Yeah.
[04:57:09] That's why I was like, it's kind of like, you know, it's a working, it's a working,
[04:57:11] what do you call it, slogan?

[05:01:30] mothers, the fathers, the brothers and sisters.
[05:01:34] Thanks to all you families that support our service men and women around the world.

[05:02:27] dark and sometimes it might seem like there's no way out and it might seem that you're alone.
[05:02:34] But you're not alone.
[05:02:36] And there is a way out and there is light and there is life out there and it is good.
[05:02:46] But you got to hang in there.
[05:02:48] You got to never give up and you got to remember that you are never out of the fight.
[05:02:58] So keep on fighting.
[05:03:01] And until next time, Zeko and Jocko out.
