[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 363 with Echo Charles and me,
[00:00:04] Jocko willing.
[00:00:05] Good evening Echo.
[00:00:06] Good evening.
[00:00:07] All commanders should consider the professional development
[00:00:10] of their subordinates,
[00:00:11] a principal responsibility of command.
[00:00:15] Commanders should foster a personal,
[00:00:18] personal teacher-student relationship
[00:00:21] with their subordinates.
[00:00:23] Commanders are expected to conduct
[00:00:25] a continuing professional education program
[00:00:27] for their subordinates,
[00:00:29] which includes developing military judgment
[00:00:31] and decision making
[00:00:32] and teaches general professional subjects
[00:00:34] and specific technical subjects pertinent
[00:00:37] to occupational specialties.
[00:00:40] Useful tools for general professional development
[00:00:44] include supervised reading programs,
[00:00:47] map exercises, war games,
[00:00:50] battle studies and terrain studies.
[00:00:54] Commanders should see the development
[00:00:56] of their subordinates as a direct reflection of themselves.
[00:01:02] Finally, every Marine has a basic responsibility
[00:01:07] to study the profession of arms on his own.
[00:01:12] A leader without either interest in
[00:01:15] or knowledge of the history,
[00:01:17] the theory of warfare
[00:01:18] and the intellectual content of his profession
[00:01:22] is a leader in appearance only.
[00:01:27] Self-study in the art and science of war
[00:01:31] is at least equal in importance
[00:01:33] and should receive equal time
[00:01:36] to maintaining physical condition.
[00:01:39] This is particularly true among officers.
[00:01:42] After all, an officer's principal weapon is his mind.
[00:01:47] And that right there is a little excerpt
[00:01:54] from the Fleet Marine Force Manual One, War Fighting,
[00:02:01] a book that was commissioned by General Al Gray,
[00:02:04] the 29th Commandant of the Marine Corps
[00:02:06] and one of the most iconic Commandants of the Marine Corps.
[00:02:09] It's one of the first manuals
[00:02:11] that we covered on this podcast.
[00:02:13] And what that excerpt describes
[00:02:17] is an approach that I have tried to take to study war,
[00:02:21] to study history, the theory of war,
[00:02:24] the history of war, the profession of war
[00:02:28] and I've met some folks along the way
[00:02:31] who are also enthralled by the study of history and warfare
[00:02:36] and one of the most knowledgeable
[00:02:38] that I've met is here with us tonight.
[00:02:41] His name is JD, Judd JD Baker.
[00:02:45] He served in the Marine Corps for 21 years
[00:02:49] as an infantryman, a sniper, drill instructor,
[00:02:51] senior enlisted advisor in a bunch of different billets,
[00:02:55] deployed to war zones around the world
[00:02:58] and he's here with us tonight to share his experiences
[00:03:01] and lessons learned with us, JD.
[00:03:06] Thanks for coming by, man.
[00:03:07] Thanks for having me on.
[00:03:09] Let's get into it, man.
[00:03:11] You've got so much knowledge that I wanna squeeze out of you
[00:03:15] and we'll get to the end where we'll talk about
[00:03:18] how I plan to squeeze knowledge out of you.
[00:03:19] I got a whole campaign plan on how to do that.
[00:03:22] But let's talk about you, where you came from,
[00:03:25] how you grew up.
[00:03:26] So when were you born?
[00:03:28] 69, March 8th, 1969.
[00:03:31] And where?
[00:03:33] Huntington, West Virginia, right on the higher river
[00:03:37] down on the southeastern side.
[00:03:38] So you could basically swim to Ohio and walk to Kentucky.
[00:03:43] That's a pretty good triathlon right there, huh?
[00:03:45] Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:46] The three state triathlon.
[00:03:47] So what's your mom and dad do?
[00:03:49] My mom was a stay at home.
[00:03:51] My dad, he worked for a nickel plant,
[00:03:55] big industrial kind of area down there on the river,
[00:03:58] you know, West Virginia, coal, nickel,
[00:04:00] all that kind of stuff.
[00:04:01] And my dad hated his job.
[00:04:05] You had to suit and tie, go into work every day,
[00:04:08] same kind of deal.
[00:04:10] And all he wanted to do was scout major league baseball.
[00:04:14] So he put applications out all over the place,
[00:04:16] got picked up by the Pittsburgh Pirates,
[00:04:18] and got to live out the rest of his life,
[00:04:22] scoutin' baseball.
[00:04:23] Did he quit his job at the nickel plant?
[00:04:26] He just put in enough time to get retirement,
[00:04:29] like as soon as like early retirement.
[00:04:31] So it was kind of like in the military,
[00:04:32] you just do the 20 years.
[00:04:34] What is he putting on his application
[00:04:35] to become a major league scout?
[00:04:37] I mean, don't you have to spend like time
[00:04:39] looking at high schools, then maybe you get
[00:04:40] a community college, then you go to a regular college,
[00:04:43] then you get to go to be a scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates.
[00:04:47] That's a big jump out of the gate, isn't it?
[00:04:49] Yeah, it's a pretty big jump.
[00:04:51] My dad played college ball at Marshall.
[00:04:54] So he played a little bit of college ball,
[00:04:55] and you know, in our household,
[00:04:57] if it wasn't white with little red stitches on it,
[00:05:02] my dad didn't give two shits about it.
[00:05:05] So basically we were raised in a dugout,
[00:05:07] which was super cool for kids growing up
[00:05:10] with me and my older brother.
[00:05:12] So it was strictly baseball.
[00:05:14] He coached baseball, never like coached us
[00:05:17] while we were playing Little League.
[00:05:19] My dad coached Babe Ruth,
[00:05:21] he coached some of the travel teams, stuff like that.
[00:05:24] Was he smart enough to realize that he shouldn't coach you?
[00:05:28] He didn't like little kids.
[00:05:30] Okay, that'll do it too.
[00:05:32] You know what I mean?
[00:05:33] Like he didn't want to be the one out there,
[00:05:34] like you know, clapping for little Johnny
[00:05:36] and Susie telling them they're doing a great job.
[00:05:39] You know what I mean?
[00:05:40] He wanted to like to elevate, you know,
[00:05:42] kids that are 13 and above,
[00:05:45] they kind of know that they know the basics of the game.
[00:05:48] Was he doing like weird, subliminal stuff to you
[00:05:50] when you were little to like,
[00:05:52] was he like throwing the apple to you?
[00:05:55] Like, oh, hey, hey, Judd, you want an apple?
[00:05:57] Like toss it to you real quick,
[00:05:58] we gotta catch it to work on your hand, I ask you.
[00:06:00] I feel like I did that with my kids.
[00:06:02] I was doing all this weird kind of like things.
[00:06:05] Well, the funny thing is, is like both myself and my brother,
[00:06:09] we throw right, but we bat left.
[00:06:12] And I don't remember ever,
[00:06:16] like it's kind of like learning to swim.
[00:06:17] Like I don't remember when I learned to swim.
[00:06:21] And I don't remember learning how to swing a bat,
[00:06:24] but both my brother and I both bat left-handed,
[00:06:28] because in baseball you have an advantage.
[00:06:30] You're already facing first when you get done swinging.
[00:06:33] So you've got to drop.
[00:06:34] You can get the first base faster.
[00:06:37] So it was like-
[00:06:37] That's the kind of thing right there.
[00:06:38] I bet your dad was like, no, no, no,
[00:06:40] you need to stand over here, buddy, stand over here.
[00:06:43] Right.
[00:06:44] So yeah, it was all that with baseball.
[00:06:47] And of course as a kid, we loved the game.
[00:06:50] You know, we played other sports as well, but baseball was-
[00:06:54] What other sports did you play?
[00:06:55] We played soccer, we played basketball.
[00:06:57] We played a little bit of football, but not as much.
[00:07:00] It was mainly, it was baseball.
[00:07:03] Now, you played the other sports all the way through high school,
[00:07:07] or at some point did we focus and just go like,
[00:07:09] it's baseball, baseball, and baseball?
[00:07:11] It was pretty much like, you know,
[00:07:14] soccer was mainly for the running aspect,
[00:07:16] to be prepared for baseball season.
[00:07:19] Like everything came off of baseball.
[00:07:22] You know, basketball, my brother wrestled,
[00:07:25] because he wasn't coordinated enough to play basketball.
[00:07:29] So he wrestled, you know, I played basketball,
[00:07:33] I loved the game.
[00:07:34] Just a little thing here for the wrestlers out there.
[00:07:37] I gotta say this, Jeremy Stevens,
[00:07:38] you know, he's an MMA fighter and a great dude,
[00:07:41] but he wrestled in Iowa, you know, in high school and stuff.
[00:07:44] And one of their insults they would say,
[00:07:47] if someone came in, if they wrestled against a guy,
[00:07:50] or someone that was in the wrestling room,
[00:07:52] they'd be like, oh, how was that guy?
[00:07:54] He said, oh, he felt like a basketball player,
[00:07:56] meaning just like weak.
[00:07:59] So when you say, I just gotta throw that out there
[00:08:01] for the wrestlers, because I can't let it go unchecked,
[00:08:03] that you're like too not coordinated enough
[00:08:05] to play basketball.
[00:08:06] So we wrestled and said,
[00:08:07] so I gotta give some props to my wrestlers out there.
[00:08:11] Yeah, my brother on the wrestling team, you know,
[00:08:13] of course, my older brother, and of course,
[00:08:16] his wrestling friends would all come over to the house
[00:08:18] and wanna put the basketball player
[00:08:21] into a pretzel in the middle of a family room
[00:08:23] on a daily basis.
[00:08:25] The only thing I liked about it was
[00:08:27] when we sat at the dinner table, you know,
[00:08:29] I didn't have to cut weight.
[00:08:31] Oh, yeah.
[00:08:31] And my brother is over there, just like lettuce,
[00:08:35] just shaking the water off,
[00:08:37] and I've got like a big thing, a pasta,
[00:08:39] and just, you know, just wolfing it down.
[00:08:43] So I always felt bad, you know,
[00:08:46] for my brother and those aspects,
[00:08:48] but wrestling was huge in West Virginia,
[00:08:51] you know, at Huntington High,
[00:08:52] where we went to school,
[00:08:54] Coach Archer, legendary All-American wrestler
[00:08:57] coming out of there.
[00:08:59] We had some other Ken Zefalato guys,
[00:09:01] you know, wrestle Pan-An game.
[00:09:02] I mean, wrestling was huge,
[00:09:04] so it was a real big deal,
[00:09:07] but I was just thankful enough
[00:09:09] that I didn't have to like cut weight.
[00:09:12] And, you know, and the wrestling practices were just brutal.
[00:09:16] My brother would come by,
[00:09:17] I mean, basketball practice,
[00:09:18] he'd go shoot some hoop man, play a little one-on-one.
[00:09:21] You know what I mean?
[00:09:21] It was like nothing demanding.
[00:09:24] You know what I mean?
[00:09:25] You were a little, you know,
[00:09:26] back then in the 70s, those, you know, tube socks
[00:09:28] all the way up, little cute shorts, man.
[00:09:30] Yeah, little short shorts, put on a tank top, man.
[00:09:32] That's what we're doing.
[00:09:33] Yeah, you know, watch Larry Bird,
[00:09:35] Magic Johnson kind of stuff,
[00:09:37] but yeah, you played basketball.
[00:09:39] So, yeah, I always, yeah, the wrestlers,
[00:09:42] that was next level, you know.
[00:09:44] So did you, did you play three sports in high school then?
[00:09:48] Or did you at some point just play baseball?
[00:09:50] Yeah, it ended up just being baseball.
[00:09:52] Your dad's plan came together.
[00:09:54] Yeah, and the other-
[00:09:55] What position did you play?
[00:09:56] I was a pitcher.
[00:09:58] How tall are you?
[00:09:59] Six foot three.
[00:10:00] I went and talked to the Padres a few years ago.
[00:10:03] And, you know, I don't really follow baseball super close.
[00:10:06] But when I was growing up,
[00:10:07] it seemed like everyone that played baseball
[00:10:09] was like a little Dominican dude
[00:10:12] or a little Puerto Rican dude, you know, like little guys.
[00:10:15] And I went and talked to the Padres.
[00:10:17] Every one of those guys was a freaking giant human, giant.
[00:10:22] And I was like, oh, I guess it's a huge advantage.
[00:10:24] I guess it's coming back now
[00:10:25] where they got some smaller players,
[00:10:26] but it's a huge advantage, right?
[00:10:28] To be a pitcher and be six three.
[00:10:30] Oh yeah.
[00:10:31] And, you know, I started out as a kid.
[00:10:33] I think I was eight years old for my birthday.
[00:10:37] You know, we didn't make a big deal out of birthdays.
[00:10:39] We just, you know, running a mom and dad's room
[00:10:41] on your birthday and they'd have a present for you.
[00:10:43] And mom was a catcher's met.
[00:10:44] Cause they thought, you know, my dad was like,
[00:10:46] okay, he's going to be the short one.
[00:10:47] So he'll be the catcher.
[00:10:49] You know what I mean?
[00:10:50] My older brother, Tommy, he's going to be the tall one.
[00:10:52] So he'll be the pitcher.
[00:10:53] My dad was a pitcher.
[00:10:54] He's six foot three.
[00:10:56] He was a big guy.
[00:10:58] I mean, not like big unit kind of guy, that big,
[00:11:01] you know, six, seven, six, nine,
[00:11:03] but then at like 10 years old,
[00:11:06] my brother quit growing and I kept growing.
[00:11:11] So then we, we reversed.
[00:11:12] We just traded myths.
[00:11:15] So then my brother became a catcher,
[00:11:16] which I was thankful for.
[00:11:18] Cause again, as you can kind of see with like, you know,
[00:11:21] the basketball aspect, a catcher is a,
[00:11:23] that's a brutal, brutal job.
[00:11:27] You know, I mean, but you control the field.
[00:11:30] You're the leader.
[00:11:31] You're the only one that can see all eight players
[00:11:34] at one time, but you know, being a catcher,
[00:11:37] just, you know, hot, sweaty behind the plate.
[00:11:39] You're engaged in every play out there.
[00:11:43] And my brother was really good.
[00:11:44] My brother was a really good baseball player as a catcher.
[00:11:48] And then for me, being a pitcher,
[00:11:50] you're kind of like the, you know,
[00:11:51] like a basketball player compared to a wrestler.
[00:11:53] You're the, you know, you got to take care of the pitcher.
[00:11:57] And you know what I mean?
[00:11:58] He's, you know, he's special kind of aspect of it.
[00:12:02] So I didn't get beat up as much as my brother did.
[00:12:06] And how about school?
[00:12:07] Are you doing all right in school
[00:12:08] as far as like grades and everything?
[00:12:09] Do you care?
[00:12:10] Is it like no big deal?
[00:12:11] Are you getting into trouble?
[00:12:12] What's going on with your, just your youth?
[00:12:15] Yeah.
[00:12:16] School pretty much get terrible.
[00:12:20] Just, just terrible.
[00:12:21] The coolest thing in school was in the first grade.
[00:12:28] My first grade teacher was Mrs. Goheen.
[00:12:32] And Mrs. Goheen, cool thing about it is
[00:12:34] I'm friends with her on Facebook, even still today,
[00:12:36] which is like super cool with social media
[00:12:38] to be friends with Ms. Goheen.
[00:12:39] And she made us do a book report.
[00:12:42] And probably the biggest impact she had on me was
[00:12:45] she let you pick whatever book.
[00:12:47] She didn't like assign a book to make us read
[00:12:51] something specific.
[00:12:51] You got to pick whatever you wanted.
[00:12:54] Me, I did my first book report on Babe Ruth
[00:12:57] with the New York Yankees.
[00:12:58] Obviously we had a lot of baseball books in the house,
[00:13:01] just laying around everywhere.
[00:13:05] So she allowed me to write my first book report
[00:13:07] and then just to have a love of reading.
[00:13:11] It doesn't matter what you read, just read.
[00:13:14] So after that, I always enjoyed reading as a kid.
[00:13:19] But I love gym class, I liked recess, I like to play.
[00:13:24] I mean, whatever the game is, it doesn't matter.
[00:13:27] I enjoyed playing a game.
[00:13:28] And my dad was always pretty, he was pretty liberal
[00:13:33] with the aspects of boys will be boys kind of aspect.
[00:13:37] But my dad was a mathematician.
[00:13:39] So he loved math.
[00:13:41] And I'm the complete opposite.
[00:13:43] I don't like math.
[00:13:45] I'd rather the liberal arts, the history,
[00:13:47] the reading, the books and stuff.
[00:13:49] So, we kept enough to play sports.
[00:13:53] So you got to have a 2.0 to play ball.
[00:13:55] So as long as you were above a 2.0,
[00:13:57] my dad was like, well, I'm good with that.
[00:13:59] You know what I mean?
[00:14:00] I wasn't an honor society or holding candles,
[00:14:03] having photos taken in school.
[00:14:06] But I had a lot of fun, great childhood.
[00:14:10] You got an A in recess, lunch, gym class and fun.
[00:14:14] I like that.
[00:14:15] I knocked it out the park in all those areas.
[00:14:19] And then where I grew up, probably another big aspect
[00:14:23] of my life was at eight years old,
[00:14:26] my dad sent me to camp.
[00:14:29] Now, this is a camp.
[00:14:31] It's called Camp Walla-Watula.
[00:14:33] And it's in Milborough Springs, Virginia, Bath County
[00:14:36] on the Cal Pasture River.
[00:14:38] My dad went to this camp.
[00:14:41] And it's kind of like Hogsworth,
[00:14:43] and like the Harry Potter stuff where they would take us
[00:14:45] to the train station in Huntington.
[00:14:47] You'd have your big luggage,
[00:14:52] and you'd get on a train,
[00:14:53] and we would take the train to Clifton Forge, Virginia.
[00:14:57] And the counselors would pick us up from the train,
[00:15:02] throw all of our luggage in there and take us out
[00:15:04] to Camp Walla-Watula on the Cal Pasture River
[00:15:06] for seven weeks, living in tents.
[00:15:09] And it was like, I loved camp.
[00:15:14] Huntington, you'd shot 22 rifles,
[00:15:17] you shot bow and arrow, canoeing, swimming, horsebacking,
[00:15:22] oran tearing, leaf identifications,
[00:15:25] not tying, all these kind of things.
[00:15:27] And it was at Camp Walla-Watula,
[00:15:30] and I had to beg my parents to go at eight years old
[00:15:33] because normally you had to go when you were nine,
[00:15:34] but my older brother went.
[00:15:36] And when we went to go pick up my brother,
[00:15:38] and I got to see this camp, I was like, oh, this is it.
[00:15:42] Like, so we would spend seven weeks every summer
[00:15:46] on the Cal Pasture River at camp,
[00:15:49] which had a huge effect on the rest of my life.
[00:15:53] I mean, going into the Marine Corps was like going to camp.
[00:15:56] You know what I mean?
[00:15:57] I mean, you join the infantry, going to camp,
[00:16:00] you got activities.
[00:16:01] So you did that every year for, like until you were how old?
[00:16:05] Until I was 14, and then Don Sutton,
[00:16:09] the family that owned the camp that had,
[00:16:10] like I said, my dad went to that camp.
[00:16:14] He had two sons and nobody wanted to take the camp over.
[00:16:18] So they basically shut the camp down,
[00:16:20] but every June, we have a reunion
[00:16:24] with all the guys at Camp Walla-Watula.
[00:16:27] The sad thing is, is like, I'm one of the youngest
[00:16:30] of the reunion guys.
[00:16:32] And we go back every June,
[00:16:35] but being at camp with the counselors,
[00:16:37] and they had a big effect on me as a kid growing up of like,
[00:16:44] I mean, you sat at tables, they taught you manners,
[00:16:48] how to eat, how to take care of yourself,
[00:16:50] basically how to be a Virginia.
[00:16:53] And every, at the three week mark,
[00:16:57] they would take us into Lexington, Virginia.
[00:17:00] VMI's there, and then they've got the Robert E. Lee tomb is there.
[00:17:04] So we would go visit Robert E. Lee.
[00:17:07] So like at the first time at eight years old,
[00:17:10] I remember seeing the Robert E. Lee,
[00:17:12] Stonewall Jackson, Virginia, all that Washington,
[00:17:18] Virginia in history is huge.
[00:17:21] And at camp, we had mandatory like nap time,
[00:17:25] after lunch, you'd come back.
[00:17:27] And it was like reading, reading, laying rack,
[00:17:29] kind of an event.
[00:17:30] So you could bring a book, you could write letters home,
[00:17:34] the letter writing really didn't go very well.
[00:17:36] I think my mom still has the first letter I wrote,
[00:17:38] and it was like, dear mom and dad having a good Judd.
[00:17:41] And that was it, you know what I mean?
[00:17:45] But yeah, that aspect of growing up and seeing mentorship
[00:17:51] of like the counselors that came into the camp,
[00:17:54] and they mentored us at a very early age,
[00:17:57] and seeing kind of like what Wright looked like
[00:18:00] for growing into becoming a man was a huge, huge aspect.
[00:18:05] That was an all boy camp, all boys.
[00:18:07] Yep, there was an all girls camp right down the river
[00:18:10] called Camp Montchanadoa, still exists today.
[00:18:14] And we would do like a dance with them and stuff.
[00:18:17] We'd go up river and go there,
[00:18:22] nice to see young girls at a camp.
[00:18:26] So it was fun, but yeah, I mean,
[00:18:30] the Cowpasture River is a part of my life.
[00:18:32] I mean, I've got, when I die,
[00:18:34] I want to be cremated, my ashes dumped in the Cowpasture.
[00:18:38] We go every year, I mean, I love the plate.
[00:18:40] My wife and I, Tracy, we were married in the Cowpasture River,
[00:18:44] like standing in the river.
[00:18:47] Yeah, that's a huge tie to me,
[00:18:49] is that river and that part of my life.
[00:18:51] How far is that river from where you grew up?
[00:18:55] Probably about three and a half hours,
[00:18:58] three and a half hours, four hours just over the Appalachia.
[00:19:01] It's on the Virginia, West Virginia border
[00:19:05] in Bath County, Virginia, up in the mountains up there.
[00:19:09] Beautiful part.
[00:19:10] So were you on track to like go to college
[00:19:14] and play baseball?
[00:19:15] Were you good enough?
[00:19:16] Were you like, what was going on with that?
[00:19:19] Well, you know, the good thing is I had my older brother
[00:19:22] and so I could kind of like watch what he did
[00:19:25] and see his mistakes and try not to repeat,
[00:19:29] because you gotta go home and deal with my dad.
[00:19:31] So my brother went to WVU, you know what I mean?
[00:19:34] He was gonna try the college thing
[00:19:36] and my brother was a lot smarter than I was.
[00:19:42] But still, he couldn't figure out
[00:19:44] that you have to go to class to like get a grade.
[00:19:48] Did he get recruited for baseball?
[00:19:50] Was he playing baseball there?
[00:19:51] No, no, no.
[00:19:53] He just went.
[00:19:54] Yeah, he was just going to college.
[00:19:55] So despite the efforts of your dad
[00:19:57] to turn you guys into baseball players
[00:20:00] that could play in college, he didn't play in college.
[00:20:04] No, and with my dad's aspect of,
[00:20:09] he more or less looked at it on the aspects
[00:20:12] of try to go straight farm league.
[00:20:15] Like, I would say that my dad,
[00:20:19] he kind of looked at it like you can always go to college.
[00:20:21] You can be 60 years old, man.
[00:20:23] You can go to college.
[00:20:24] You get one shot to play pro ball.
[00:20:27] And you know what I mean?
[00:20:29] And you try to get in, if you can get minor league
[00:20:32] kind of aspects, he always worried about
[00:20:35] like a college coach, you know what I mean?
[00:20:37] Of their pedigree.
[00:20:39] I mean, they can ruin, they can ruin a guy
[00:20:43] because in college, college coach, he's there to win.
[00:20:46] He's gonna throw you, he's gonna work you
[00:20:47] as much as possible because that's his job.
[00:20:50] And college baseball isn't necessarily
[00:20:53] like a big thing like college football.
[00:20:55] I mean, to play pro football, you gotta go to college.
[00:20:58] You gotta play college ball.
[00:20:59] You're not gonna go direct to where like baseball
[00:21:03] is more of a direct, you know, the Derek Jeter's,
[00:21:06] the Griffys, those kind of guys.
[00:21:08] You don't go to college.
[00:21:09] You go straight to the minor leagues
[00:21:11] and then you work your way through the minors.
[00:21:13] So that was more of, I would say my dad's
[00:21:15] kind of take on things was.
[00:21:17] But your brother decided to go to college.
[00:21:19] Yeah, he was gonna go to college.
[00:21:21] Again, my brother was really, he was good in school.
[00:21:24] My brother was a lot smarter than I was.
[00:21:26] He paid attention a lot more than I did.
[00:21:29] So he went to WVU, but like I said,
[00:21:32] he didn't go to class much.
[00:21:34] You know, college football games were great on Saturday
[00:21:37] kind of thing.
[00:21:37] I'd go up and hang out with my brother.
[00:21:40] And then he ended up, you know, not making the grades
[00:21:44] and they're like, yeah, you can't stay at school here anymore.
[00:21:49] So my brother, he joined the Air Force.
[00:21:52] He's like, yeah, well, you know,
[00:21:53] dad's like, yeah, not, you don't wanna hang out
[00:21:56] in the house here.
[00:21:57] Let's come back.
[00:21:58] So my brother joined the Air Force.
[00:21:59] And when he joined the Air Force,
[00:22:01] he was a worked on C-130s, crew chief stuff with C-130s.
[00:22:05] He was out of Dias, Texas.
[00:22:07] I mean, it seemed like a pretty good gig
[00:22:09] for what he was doing.
[00:22:11] And then for me, you know, when I was 17,
[00:22:15] I played on a couple of travel teams.
[00:22:17] And we were playing in Cincinnati.
[00:22:21] And, you know, regardless of my dad,
[00:22:25] I mean, I love my dad to death.
[00:22:27] But, you know, his nickname,
[00:22:28] yeah, between like me and my brother,
[00:22:30] and then we called him the dick.
[00:22:34] And love him to death.
[00:22:35] But I mean, you know, all my friends were like,
[00:22:37] dude, it must be so cool having like, you know,
[00:22:39] cause my dad's nickname was T-Bone.
[00:22:41] So they were like, dude, it's like so cool.
[00:22:43] Like, you know, your dad T-Bone.
[00:22:45] Cause everybody thought my dad was great.
[00:22:46] You know what I mean?
[00:22:47] Cause at all the games, you know,
[00:22:49] whether it was football, basketball, you name it.
[00:22:51] I mean, why did they call him T-Bone?
[00:22:52] Just cause his name Tom Baker.
[00:22:54] And he was, you know, six foot three, you know,
[00:22:56] hundred and, you know, 55 pounds.
[00:22:58] He looked like just a T-Bone coming off of a stake.
[00:23:02] And so they called him T-Bone.
[00:23:03] And everybody thought it was like the coolest thing.
[00:23:05] Well, it's like, well, dude,
[00:23:06] you didn't live with my dad.
[00:23:08] Like, of course he's cool outside of the house,
[00:23:11] but step into the house and live with this guy.
[00:23:14] I mean, and again, it was still, it was great.
[00:23:18] But, you know, my dad was, I mean, he was funny, humorous,
[00:23:22] you know, but yeah, I loved him to death, but he,
[00:23:26] we came back from playing in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[00:23:30] And, you know, I was throwing in a game.
[00:23:32] You know, my dad and I kind of got into it a little bit
[00:23:35] at the game.
[00:23:37] And I was like, I'm done.
[00:23:39] You know what I mean?
[00:23:39] I'm done.
[00:23:40] I came back.
[00:23:42] Went straight up 17.
[00:23:44] Went to the Marine Corps recruiting office.
[00:23:46] How'd you hear about the Marine Corps?
[00:23:48] I had a buddy of mine.
[00:23:50] Actually, I had quite a few friends of mine of our class.
[00:23:53] It was a lot that went in the Marine Corps.
[00:23:55] Rick Schenck was one of them.
[00:23:57] His dad was a Korean, Vietnam vet.
[00:23:59] He was an Army Ranger guy.
[00:24:02] But, you know, there was a lot of us
[00:24:03] that had looked at the military in a blue collar town
[00:24:08] like Huntington.
[00:24:09] It's a way out.
[00:24:11] You know what I mean?
[00:24:12] There's a lot of folks that joined the military to get out.
[00:24:15] You know what I mean?
[00:24:17] There's something bigger out there.
[00:24:19] And again, like I said, I loved camp.
[00:24:23] And, you know, I don't have to like...
[00:24:25] Those recruiters, man, they were licking their chops
[00:24:28] when you showed up.
[00:24:29] Oh, I was an idiot.
[00:24:30] They're like, oh, you like camp?
[00:24:31] We got camp for you, son.
[00:24:32] Yeah, I mean, I love camp.
[00:24:33] Yeah.
[00:24:34] Yeah, and they've got activities.
[00:24:36] Tents.
[00:24:37] They got tents.
[00:24:38] They give you all this free stuff, you get a gun.
[00:24:43] So yeah, I mean, I was like, oh, you know,
[00:24:45] when I came in there, I was like, you know,
[00:24:47] telling them to recruit, I was like,
[00:24:48] hey, I've got to be infantry.
[00:24:50] And, you know, and he's giving us the look like,
[00:24:52] oh, that's going to be a difficult one to get.
[00:24:54] You know what I mean?
[00:24:56] Because we didn't really know a lot.
[00:24:58] And, you know, and of course I can get you,
[00:25:01] you know, guaranteed, you know, infantry.
[00:25:04] You know, if you score high enough.
[00:25:05] He's taking care of you.
[00:25:06] Yeah, I'm thinking like this guy's the heat.
[00:25:08] Like he's hooking us up until I go to boot camp.
[00:25:12] You know what I mean?
[00:25:13] But then I'm 17, so I got to get a signature.
[00:25:15] So, so you're 17, you're 17.
[00:25:18] Are you done with high school?
[00:25:19] No, no, no, I still have my senior year to go.
[00:25:21] So I was like delayed entry.
[00:25:22] Okay.
[00:25:23] But I had to get my mom to sign.
[00:25:24] Uh-huh.
[00:25:25] And what mama say?
[00:25:26] Mom was all about.
[00:25:27] She's down for the cause.
[00:25:29] Just give me that paper.
[00:25:31] Let me get my signature out of here.
[00:25:33] Yeah.
[00:25:34] Yeah, why even waste your time?
[00:25:36] Yeah.
[00:25:37] Which was, you know, when you look back at like,
[00:25:39] at life of like a decision that you made,
[00:25:42] that was probably the smartest decision I ever made.
[00:25:46] Cause I would have been a shit show.
[00:25:48] For sure.
[00:25:49] Oh, I'm right there with you.
[00:25:50] Yeah.
[00:25:51] Thanks, thanks to my recruiter.
[00:25:53] I can't, I don't even remember anything about my recruiter.
[00:25:55] But I just would like to thank him.
[00:25:56] Even though he probably screwed me over.
[00:25:58] He's like, oh yeah, you're going to go
[00:25:59] into the SEAL team?
[00:26:00] Sure, buddy.
[00:26:00] Yeah, you look, oh yeah, you're going to make
[00:26:03] a great SEAL, right?
[00:26:05] That's bullshit.
[00:26:07] Like there's no way any recruiter knows
[00:26:09] if anyone has the remotest chance of making a, yeah.
[00:26:12] SEAL teams, you seem like the kind of guy
[00:26:13] that's going to do great there.
[00:26:14] It's like, yep, just sign this piece of paper.
[00:26:16] Sounds great.
[00:26:17] You know, recruiter or sir?
[00:26:19] So those guys are definitely hooking you up.
[00:26:20] But like, that's the same with me.
[00:26:23] That the greatest thing, probably like you said,
[00:26:25] the single pivot point of the trajectory of my life
[00:26:29] was signing that piece of paper and saying, yep, I'm in.
[00:26:32] And I remember, I signed up for six years.
[00:26:34] It was six years to get a SEAL, to get a BUDDS contract
[00:26:38] where you go to BUDDS.
[00:26:39] Actually all it was, actually all it was
[00:26:41] was you sign up for six years and that gives you a chance
[00:26:44] to take the screening test to possibly pass,
[00:26:46] to possibly go to BUDDS.
[00:26:47] That's what it was.
[00:26:48] And you know, you're thinking you're 18 years old.
[00:26:51] Like six years is a long, that's one third of your life.
[00:26:55] And I remember just thinking, well, whatever.
[00:26:57] Well, rock and roll, let's do this.
[00:26:59] But definitely a pivot point.
[00:27:01] That's interesting because they got me on the six year.
[00:27:05] But they gave you infantry?
[00:27:07] Yeah, I mean, guaranteed infantry.
[00:27:10] Guarantee.
[00:27:11] I wonder how many bonus points he got for that,
[00:27:13] that they're recruiting.
[00:27:15] So you roll in there, you enlist, now you're in.
[00:27:19] You have to go to debt meetings your whole senior year
[00:27:21] of high school or something like that?
[00:27:23] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:23] We kind of meet on the weekends and go for runs
[00:27:27] and stuff like that.
[00:27:28] So basically, my senior year was,
[00:27:30] I mean, I think I took like four gym classes.
[00:27:33] You know, because I was like, okay, I'm done.
[00:27:37] Like this is what I'm gonna do.
[00:27:39] So why do I need to, and of course-
[00:27:41] Did you even play baseball your senior year?
[00:27:42] No, I quit everything.
[00:27:44] I mean, my dad was not happy.
[00:27:47] I was gonna say.
[00:27:48] Yeah, it was, but you know, he looked at it as,
[00:27:53] I don't think my dad was like a big fan of me
[00:27:57] making that decision of going in the Marines.
[00:28:02] But, you know, I mean, when I remember he took me down there
[00:28:06] to the recruiting office to drop me off,
[00:28:08] because I shipped like three days after graduation.
[00:28:11] Like the recruiter was standing at the graduation.
[00:28:14] So when I walked across and I got the piece of paper,
[00:28:17] you know, they gotta like take it to make copies.
[00:28:19] Yeah, he's there.
[00:28:20] Oh, he's there.
[00:28:21] But yeah.
[00:28:22] We get this in the Xerox machine, son.
[00:28:23] Well, the funny thing is, there's like six other
[00:28:25] of my classmates that are just as stupid as me,
[00:28:28] and we're all going to boot camp together.
[00:28:29] Which kind of made it fun.
[00:28:32] Yeah, so I had like Ricky Shank and Carrie Nessle
[00:28:34] are like literally in the same recruit platoon as me.
[00:28:37] Don't kid him.
[00:28:38] Yeah, so it was kind of fun to where,
[00:28:41] when you're seeing the drill instructor kind of,
[00:28:43] you know, give them a ration and you're over there
[00:28:45] trying not to laugh, but like what's going on
[00:28:48] and then they're doing the same thing to you.
[00:28:49] So it was kind of nice.
[00:28:52] Like I said, it was kind of like going to camp.
[00:28:54] You know what I mean? I had some of my friends there
[00:28:55] that I'd known since, you know, I grew up with them.
[00:28:59] And there was a, you know, so it was cool to have,
[00:29:02] you know, a couple of guys that I went to school with
[00:29:04] and ran around with a lot in my recruit platoon.
[00:29:09] But I didn't realize like, and we were all guaranteed
[00:29:11] infantry by the way.
[00:29:13] I mean, you know, they don't make them smart
[00:29:15] coming out of Huntington West Virginia.
[00:29:17] And the recruiter is probably just, you know, he's loving it.
[00:29:20] So until we like, they're announcing
[00:29:24] like your military MOS at the end, you know,
[00:29:27] the senior drill instructor stand up there.
[00:29:29] He's like, you know, Baker infantry, you know what I mean?
[00:29:32] He's like, guaranteed boy, you're some kind of stupid.
[00:29:35] You know what I mean?
[00:29:37] But, you know, back then like, I didn't really know
[00:29:39] that like there was other jobs like in the Marines.
[00:29:44] Cause I knew like, you know, Navy dock, you know,
[00:29:46] we get a lot of our stuff from the Navy.
[00:29:49] You know, I thought like everybody
[00:29:50] went in the Marine Corps to be infantry.
[00:29:52] And, you know, and then you got cooks.
[00:29:55] Every Marine rifleman to you is the facts.
[00:29:58] You can't say.
[00:29:59] Yeah.
[00:30:00] Is it everybody?
[00:30:00] How was boot camp when you showed up?
[00:30:02] Was it like a shocker?
[00:30:03] Were you like, holy shit?
[00:30:05] Or were you just like, hey, camp, let's do this?
[00:30:08] Yeah.
[00:30:09] Of course, you know, the shock and all of, you know,
[00:30:12] when they bring in, I went to Paris Island.
[00:30:15] When I flew out of the Huntington, it's the Tri-State
[00:30:20] airport of what they call it.
[00:30:21] And that was the first time I had ever been to an airport.
[00:30:25] And I don't know, you know, the history of Huntington,
[00:30:28] of Marshall University, you might have seen the We Are
[00:30:31] Marshall, the 1970 plane crash, the NCAA history,
[00:30:36] you know, most fatalities.
[00:30:39] And that was at that airport.
[00:30:41] So where I grew up, the whole Marshall University
[00:30:45] in that plane crash, November 14th, 1970,
[00:30:49] you know, every year in Huntington.
[00:30:51] I mean, it's a big deal for that Marshall plane crash.
[00:30:56] I had, you know, kids that I went to school with
[00:30:59] that, you know, their parents were on that plane.
[00:31:03] You know, it devastated the community in Huntington.
[00:31:07] And then here I am going to the airport, you know,
[00:31:10] and I was like, by the way, why can't we just like
[00:31:13] take a bus, it's South Carolina, man.
[00:31:15] You know what I mean?
[00:31:16] Like, can we just, so it was one of those props
[00:31:18] that's got like the little curtain that the, you know,
[00:31:21] the pilot like puts luggage on and then he takes the curtain
[00:31:24] and whips it over there to the side.
[00:31:26] And you know what I mean?
[00:31:27] And that almost stopped me from going to boot camp.
[00:31:32] I mean, I was like, this is ridiculous, man.
[00:31:34] Why are we flying?
[00:31:35] And so I got down there and then they bring in at night.
[00:31:39] You know, so you don't really know like where you're going.
[00:31:42] And it's, you know, coming on to Paris Island.
[00:31:44] And of course you hear all the mystique of Paris Island.
[00:31:47] And of course you remember Full Metal Jacket.
[00:31:48] It just came out when you and I were in high school.
[00:31:51] So of course, you know, that dude's like a stamina comic.
[00:31:55] You know what I mean?
[00:31:56] That movie was hilarious.
[00:31:57] You know what I mean?
[00:31:58] And I'd probably say that with the drill instructors are,
[00:32:03] they're stand up comics.
[00:32:05] I mean, some of the stuff that they do is just,
[00:32:08] it's Saturday Night Live, but it's like 18 hours
[00:32:11] of Saturday Night Live a day.
[00:32:12] And you're getting the end of the joke.
[00:32:16] You're the butt of all the jokes.
[00:32:17] Yeah, you're the butt of all the jokes.
[00:32:19] But it was still, it was a, it was, you know, the shock
[00:32:22] and all, but then once we kind of got into the rhythm
[00:32:24] of boot camp, then, you know, with the drill instructors.
[00:32:28] What year is this?
[00:32:29] Is this 87?
[00:32:30] 87.
[00:32:31] 87.
[00:32:32] Yep, June.
[00:32:33] So, you know, go the way until the winter time
[00:32:35] to make it a little bit more pleasant down there.
[00:32:37] But yeah, so we ended up there in June,
[00:32:40] graduated in August, you know, three months down there.
[00:32:45] And then went straight off to Camp Lejeune,
[00:32:48] went up to Camp Geiger's where the infantry school was
[00:32:52] at the time and went through, you know,
[00:32:53] Infantry Training School, 0311, you made it.
[00:32:57] How?
[00:32:58] How 311, you made it.
[00:33:02] How was that, how was that infantry school?
[00:33:04] Again, you know, kind of looking back on,
[00:33:12] I mean, it's so many like new Marines coming in
[00:33:17] that you don't really like get a lot of that
[00:33:20] individual education training.
[00:33:23] How long was the school?
[00:33:25] I think it was like 10 weeks, maybe.
[00:33:27] Did you have Vietnam guys teaching you or not really?
[00:33:31] Some of the older, like the E7s and E8s that were there
[00:33:35] were Vietnam era guys, but you know,
[00:33:38] like what you would call like the troop handlers
[00:33:42] or more like the corporals and the sergeants kind of.
[00:33:44] So those guys had come in in like the early 80s
[00:33:48] and were there, but the senior folks,
[00:33:51] yeah, they were Vietnam era guys.
[00:33:54] Did you think you were going to war at some point?
[00:33:59] Yeah, no.
[00:34:00] Yeah, I mean, never really even like crossed my mind,
[00:34:05] you know, at the point, you know, when,
[00:34:09] like I remember I listened to you when you had like,
[00:34:11] when you and Dave, when you had Dave Burke on,
[00:34:13] you were talking about like the top gun when like we grew up.
[00:34:16] I was more of the John Jay Rambo kind of like being John Jay
[00:34:21] kind of turned me on more than like Tom Cruise.
[00:34:24] Oh yeah, for sure.
[00:34:25] I mean, I couldn't relate to Tom Cruise.
[00:34:28] Yeah, I wanted like the green Odie green jacket
[00:34:31] where jeans boots get a big knife with like a compass
[00:34:34] on the top of it, you know what I mean?
[00:34:36] With matches in it.
[00:34:38] Yeah, I wanted to be John Jay.
[00:34:40] So, you know, those aspects of it were pretty interesting.
[00:34:46] Did you have like a global perspective of the world
[00:34:49] and think, well, you know, it's the, you know,
[00:34:53] Cold War is going on, you know, this could kick off.
[00:34:56] Did you, did you have any thoughts like that?
[00:34:59] Yeah, no.
[00:35:00] Yeah, I was gonna say, because I, you know,
[00:35:02] I joined in 1990.
[00:35:03] Now what changed for me was that the Gulf War was starting,
[00:35:06] right?
[00:35:07] So when I came in, it was like, oh, we're going on.
[00:35:10] I remember watching CNN and CNN is saying there's gonna be
[00:35:13] something like 30,000 casualties in the first 48 hours
[00:35:16] on our side.
[00:35:17] And I was like, oh, bro, we're going.
[00:35:19] Like I was thinking it's on.
[00:35:21] I'm gonna get some for sure.
[00:35:24] And then once that was over, it seemed like that I just
[00:35:28] seemed like, well, I'm gonna be doing some kind of secret
[00:35:30] shit's going on, you know, like the SEAL teams,
[00:35:32] come on, we're doing stuff worldwide all the time.
[00:35:35] There's secret missions going on.
[00:35:37] I'm obviously going to Vietnam and fighting whatever
[00:35:40] John Jay Rambo style for that stuff.
[00:35:43] But going to the Marine Corps 1987,
[00:35:47] the world was pretty, pretty peaceful at that time.
[00:35:50] Yeah, you know, in the Marines, we had one of the corporals
[00:35:55] that was there that was at the infantry school.
[00:35:58] He was a Beirut guy.
[00:36:00] So, you know, like back then, like Beirut was like,
[00:36:03] which was huge for the Marine Corps, you know, that incident.
[00:36:07] And so that was kind of, you know, Beirut and Granada
[00:36:11] were pretty much like the only two things.
[00:36:13] And if you weren't with like a specific one battalion,
[00:36:17] then everybody else in the Marine Corps, you know,
[00:36:19] they just had the overseas deployment ribbon
[00:36:22] with the good conduct.
[00:36:23] And that's it, you know what I mean?
[00:36:25] There wasn't any like solids hanging out
[00:36:29] except for the, you know, the Beirut guys.
[00:36:32] And then I would say that my first battalion I got sent to
[00:36:37] was second battalion, eighth Marines.
[00:36:39] And it was on Camp Geiger.
[00:36:40] And all that I did was was put my C-bag on my back
[00:36:43] and face to the right.
[00:36:44] And we just walked down to the eighth Marines barracks
[00:36:47] and it was open squad bay.
[00:36:49] That's where your first assignment was?
[00:36:51] Mm-hmm.
[00:36:51] That was second battalion, eighth Marines.
[00:36:52] That was on Camp Geiger.
[00:36:54] It was a eighth Marine regiment was on Geiger.
[00:36:56] Everybody else was on main side Camp Lejeune.
[00:36:59] And Geiger was open squad bay.
[00:37:02] So it was, and a lot of people talk about like being
[00:37:04] an open squad, I loved open squad.
[00:37:07] It was camp.
[00:37:07] Yeah.
[00:37:08] I mean, you know what I mean?
[00:37:09] What a camp.
[00:37:10] It was more camp.
[00:37:11] You know what I mean?
[00:37:12] I got up there, you know, you're in the platoon.
[00:37:13] You really get to know like the guys in the platoon
[00:37:16] because of the open squad bay.
[00:37:17] I mean, there's no hiding from anybody.
[00:37:20] It's not like at the end of the day,
[00:37:21] you go to your barracks room and you shut the door
[00:37:23] and it's just you and one other guy and the open squad bay.
[00:37:25] People can walk through it anytime.
[00:37:27] It's all your stuff's exposed.
[00:37:29] You get a foot locker and a wall locker and that's it.
[00:37:32] So you didn't really, you know, like nowadays,
[00:37:34] like kids move into their rooms and they got TVs,
[00:37:36] they got Xbox, they got all this kind of stuff.
[00:37:39] You couldn't have that stuff, you know,
[00:37:41] because you had one TV and the duty NCO controlled
[00:37:45] what channel it was on.
[00:37:48] But yeah, so it was pretty cool on those aspects.
[00:37:52] And then as soon as I got to Second Battalion,
[00:37:54] Eighth Marines, my first training op was cold weather training
[00:38:00] up the Bridgeport, California, which was banging.
[00:38:02] Yeah.
[00:38:04] You know what I mean?
[00:38:05] They got ski lifts up there.
[00:38:06] We're skiing.
[00:38:06] Of course that was the first time like you ski uphill,
[00:38:09] like with a pack, which that sucks.
[00:38:12] It's not as cool as you thought it was.
[00:38:12] Yeah, not as cool, you know what I mean?
[00:38:14] Like I wanted to go to like Tahoe and do some downhill.
[00:38:18] And then of course, you know, Marine Corps
[00:38:19] with our mountaineering skis are low as bitter.
[00:38:22] So it's like two by four strapped with a, you know what I mean?
[00:38:25] With a boot band wrapped around your Mickey Mouse boots.
[00:38:28] And you're going to head down the hill
[00:38:30] with a 90 pound Ruck-On and a rifle hanging off
[00:38:32] the front of you.
[00:38:34] That was the only point that I was really excited
[00:38:37] that I wasn't a machine gunner.
[00:38:39] You know what I mean?
[00:38:40] Like skiing with a machine gun.
[00:38:42] There's a whole other level.
[00:38:44] And how long were you at 28 for?
[00:38:48] I was at 28 for, I stayed from just at the end of 87,
[00:38:54] right into 89.
[00:38:56] Oh, so you did years there.
[00:38:57] This is your first assignment.
[00:38:59] Yeah.
[00:38:59] Yeah, this is my first battalion.
[00:39:01] What do you do?
[00:39:02] Did you go on deployment from there?
[00:39:04] Yep.
[00:39:04] So we did like the Bridgeport thing.
[00:39:06] You know, you do like your work up.
[00:39:07] But did you do, you do a work up?
[00:39:09] Did you go like get on a boat and go on deployment
[00:39:11] to the med or something like that?
[00:39:12] Well, we actually did Westpac because we came in,
[00:39:16] flew over to Oki and then my first boat ride
[00:39:19] was on the USS Fort McHenry.
[00:39:22] Right on.
[00:39:23] Which, you know, as a kid in camp,
[00:39:26] like I read, like, I enjoy reading and books on adventure.
[00:39:33] You know what I mean?
[00:39:34] And I always thought like,
[00:39:35] when I look at like a Navy ship,
[00:39:37] it's kind of like being in Huntington, West Virginia.
[00:39:40] It's a blue collar community, a float.
[00:39:44] So these are like all the guys, like in the Navy,
[00:39:46] like they got guys that like have jobs.
[00:39:49] Like they do stuff.
[00:39:50] Diesel mechanics.
[00:39:51] Yeah.
[00:39:52] You know what I mean?
[00:39:52] And like we're in the Pacific.
[00:39:55] You know what I mean?
[00:39:56] And it's just like, you get to see how small you actually are.
[00:40:01] But you know, being with the Navy,
[00:40:02] Marines don't have a job on the boat.
[00:40:04] You know what I mean?
[00:40:05] We get up, we are point of place of duty is in the rack.
[00:40:08] We stand in Chow line a lot.
[00:40:11] You know what I mean?
[00:40:12] It's like, get done with breakfast.
[00:40:13] What are you going to do?
[00:40:14] I'm going to go wait for lunch.
[00:40:15] Go wait for lunch.
[00:40:16] Stand in line and sit there with a book.
[00:40:18] And when the Navy gets pissed off
[00:40:20] that the Marines are laying around all over their stuff,
[00:40:22] they call general quarters and we go to the rack.
[00:40:25] And, you know, and they go to work.
[00:40:26] But yeah, I was always intrigued with the Navy.
[00:40:30] Like, you know, and then just the global of travel
[00:40:34] and like a Navy ship captain.
[00:40:37] Always seemed like a super cool job to have
[00:40:42] being a, you know, aboard a ship.
[00:40:44] And it's so blue collar.
[00:40:46] I mean, the guys in the Navy aboard the ships,
[00:40:48] you know, we floated Gator Navy.
[00:40:50] But they were like super great guys.
[00:40:53] They all had skill sets from, you know, electricians
[00:40:56] to the laundry, the cooks.
[00:40:58] I mean, it just, it was, it was like, you know,
[00:41:00] being in Pittsburgh, you know,
[00:41:02] except everybody doesn't have a mullet.
[00:41:04] You know what I mean?
[00:41:05] They got a haircut.
[00:41:06] And it's like you're a float with a blue collar town.
[00:41:10] And it was a, it was super cool.
[00:41:11] We went to Korea, you know what I mean?
[00:41:14] So, and that was one of the things that intrigued me
[00:41:15] about just joining the Marines was I was going to get
[00:41:18] the travel and get paid.
[00:41:21] Like, you know what I mean?
[00:41:22] I get to go to cool places and, you know,
[00:41:24] so, you know, going to Korea, going to Japan, Philippines,
[00:41:29] you know, those kind of aspects.
[00:41:30] And I'm getting a paycheck at the same time.
[00:41:32] Are you guys doing exercises there?
[00:41:33] We're just going to go ashore.
[00:41:34] Yeah, you know, like Team Spirit.
[00:41:35] You know, all those little names that they have for stuff
[00:41:38] because, you know, we're fighting Ivan.
[00:41:39] So everything's in Ivan.
[00:41:42] And, you know, we just, we go out, we go to the field,
[00:41:45] we run exercises, we come back, and then we get like,
[00:41:48] you know, like four or five days off.
[00:41:51] And in 88, the Olympics were in Seoul, Korea.
[00:41:54] So that was-
[00:41:55] So you were there for that?
[00:41:57] Yeah, like-
[00:41:57] Did you guys work security or anything or no?
[00:41:59] No, no, yeah.
[00:42:01] The Marines stay down in Po-hang,
[00:42:04] right outside of Po-hang, and it was called Camp Moonchuck.
[00:42:07] We called it Mudchuck.
[00:42:10] You were still burning shitters there.
[00:42:12] Yeah, I mean, it was primitive camp.
[00:42:17] This is where you guys, when the ship pulled in,
[00:42:19] that's where you went?
[00:42:20] Yep, Navy would kick us off, you know what I mean?
[00:42:23] And then we'd go into Camp Mudchuck,
[00:42:25] and we'd go into there.
[00:42:27] But, you know, and then they had ranges.
[00:42:28] We would, you know, do company exercises,
[00:42:30] battalion exercises, grenade range.
[00:42:32] And you're a straight rifleman in a platoon.
[00:42:34] You're a straight rifleman.
[00:42:35] That's it, rifleman.
[00:42:37] Did you like being a rifleman?
[00:42:39] I loved it.
[00:42:40] I mean, it's all, I mean, like being a rifleman,
[00:42:42] you just get a rifle.
[00:42:43] Yeah.
[00:42:45] It was super, yeah, it was super cool.
[00:42:47] The guys in a platoon, you know,
[00:42:49] you got all these different characters,
[00:42:51] just from all over, that just make things like so interesting.
[00:42:55] Just, you know, of hearing the stories
[00:42:58] and their background, where they grew up.
[00:43:01] You know, and back then,
[00:43:02] we didn't really intermix a lot with like the platoon commander.
[00:43:05] Mm-hmm.
[00:43:06] You know what I mean?
[00:43:07] Like our biggest is usually like your squad leader,
[00:43:11] because he controls your life.
[00:43:13] And then the platoon sergeant is a big role.
[00:43:16] And, you know, like the lieutenant,
[00:43:18] you'd like see him at like formation or something.
[00:43:20] You know what I mean?
[00:43:21] Because like you didn't stay in the same,
[00:43:24] you know, officers are segregated out, you know,
[00:43:27] and then you just, what we, you know,
[00:43:29] they're not in cell block.
[00:43:30] You know what I mean?
[00:43:31] Like we're hanging out.
[00:43:32] This is back when the Marines had,
[00:43:34] didn't you have name tags on their uniforms?
[00:43:37] No.
[00:43:38] It was just like, what's your name?
[00:43:39] My name is Corporal.
[00:43:40] Yeah, that's it.
[00:43:42] You can call me Marine if you want.
[00:43:44] Yeah.
[00:43:45] I rode to point on ships,
[00:43:46] because I did a few deployments,
[00:43:47] or I did three deployments on ships with Marines
[00:43:49] and one with the carrier strike group.
[00:43:52] But yeah, the Marines were just,
[00:43:53] the other, I have to tell the story.
[00:43:55] We, you know, there's a pain to get off the ship
[00:43:57] when you pulled in, when you hit the pier,
[00:43:59] because as soon as they rang the Liberty Bell,
[00:44:00] everyone was in line to get out.
[00:44:02] And it would take like an hour or more
[00:44:04] to get to get through that line.
[00:44:06] So we used to, ship pulls in, gets pier aside.
[00:44:10] As soon as they call for Liberty,
[00:44:11] we'd go to the gym and get a good workout
[00:44:13] because the ship's not moving.
[00:44:15] And there's no one in there
[00:44:16] because everyone's trying to go on Liberty.
[00:44:17] So there's one time we do that, you know,
[00:44:19] get down, go, go work out, get down, take a shower,
[00:44:22] put on our Liberty clothes.
[00:44:23] It's been like an hour and a half.
[00:44:25] And we go up to the quarter deck to leave.
[00:44:28] And they're carrying a Marine back who was so wasted.
[00:44:32] He got wasted in an hour and a half.
[00:44:34] He was unconscious drunk, bro.
[00:44:36] That's how hard he was going in the paint.
[00:44:39] So that's, you know, good times with Marine Corps.
[00:44:42] That's usually every, every port call.
[00:44:45] I mean, somebody's going to ruin it.
[00:44:48] And, and the thing that I used to always tell the Marine,
[00:44:50] I mean, it's almost like being in jail.
[00:44:53] Like if you go to the first port call
[00:44:56] and you, you're done training in the first hour and a half
[00:44:59] and then you get restricted to the boat
[00:45:00] for six months of restriction.
[00:45:02] I mean, that's prison.
[00:45:03] Yeah. That's a sentence.
[00:45:05] You know, everybody else is like, you know,
[00:45:07] hitting it and, you know, but it's, you know,
[00:45:10] when you, when you, when you keep everybody, you know,
[00:45:12] caged up down there and cell block
[00:45:15] and you're crossing the pond.
[00:45:17] And then, you know, you hit this Liberty port
[00:45:19] and you're like, I mean, you're, you're 18, 19 years old.
[00:45:23] And you're, you're legal drinking age everywhere in the world,
[00:45:26] but here, you know what I mean?
[00:45:28] And, and of course, you know, and,
[00:45:30] but you've been in like training.
[00:45:32] So, you know, through boot camp and infantry schools.
[00:45:34] So it's not like, and you can't have beer in a barracks
[00:45:36] because I lived in an open squad base.
[00:45:38] So it wasn't like we even had refrigerators.
[00:45:41] Yeah. So any chance you got
[00:45:42] for like two and a half, three years living
[00:45:44] in an open Bay barracks.
[00:45:46] Yeah. Oh yeah. It was, loved it.
[00:45:49] I mean, we used to like take the wall lockers.
[00:45:52] Those old gray wall lock and put them up against the walls.
[00:45:55] And, you know, and we would play hardball baseball.
[00:45:58] Like cause you couldn't break anything.
[00:46:01] I mean, it was like, you know, just the antics that went on.
[00:46:04] And, you know, the only bad, you know, like back then
[00:46:06] you could still smoke in the government areas.
[00:46:09] And even on ship, I mean, I can remember being on the boats
[00:46:12] and just like you'd go into the, to the cell block area
[00:46:15] where the Marines are down there.
[00:46:16] And there's just like that haze of smoke across the top.
[00:46:20] But, you know, a guy's just laying around with a like Coke can
[00:46:24] flicking ashes in it.
[00:46:25] You know, it was a, it was a different, different world.
[00:46:29] Did you, did you know you were like,
[00:46:31] do you found your place when you got in the Marine Corps?
[00:46:33] Were you like, oh, this is, I'm good.
[00:46:35] I've got my job forever.
[00:46:37] Yeah. Yeah.
[00:46:39] I mean, it was like, I'm going to just go to camp
[00:46:42] for the rest of my life.
[00:46:43] Yeah. And the funny thing was, is, you know, you, you know,
[00:46:47] we, you talked about Al Gray.
[00:46:49] So this is 87.
[00:46:51] He became the commandant while I was in boot camp.
[00:46:55] So, I mean, you talk about just that a different kind of guy
[00:47:00] of, of Al Gray.
[00:47:01] I mean, it's what a lot of us consider the second enlightenment
[00:47:04] of the Marine Corps.
[00:47:06] And this guy is all about education.
[00:47:10] You know, he's all about, he wants a university.
[00:47:13] You know, I mean, I give it probably the coolest story
[00:47:16] of Al Gray.
[00:47:17] I met him in 89.
[00:47:20] First battalion six Marines were looking for folks to do
[00:47:23] contingency operations in Panama.
[00:47:25] Noriega was running the joint down there.
[00:47:27] So I left two eight, joined one six to be able to go do
[00:47:32] contingency operations in Panama.
[00:47:34] You know what I mean?
[00:47:35] I thought one Panama triple canopy jungle,
[00:47:37] it's got to be cool.
[00:47:39] You know, I mean, and it was just another experience
[00:47:44] to be able to.
[00:47:44] I went to one six and I was down there.
[00:47:49] And we stayed at the Rodman Naval Air Force,
[00:47:53] Naval base down there right on the canal.
[00:47:55] They had a Howard Air Force base that's down there.
[00:47:57] And then the Marines operated out of what was called
[00:48:00] the Aerehan Tank Farm.
[00:48:02] It kind of looked like if you flew over top of it,
[00:48:05] it looked like a golf course cut in the middle of the jungle.
[00:48:08] Well, it was all like the tanks for refueling,
[00:48:12] coming through the canal.
[00:48:14] And just seeing the Panama Canal was like the greatest
[00:48:17] engineering like I had ever seen like before.
[00:48:22] Cause it used to be the Panama path.
[00:48:25] You know, they used to just walk across
[00:48:27] cause it was the skinniest point.
[00:48:28] And to watch the locks and the ships come through
[00:48:31] the canal was just amazing.
[00:48:34] So, you know, for a 19 year old kid,
[00:48:36] like seeing the Panama Canal and, you know,
[00:48:39] reading about it, it was just,
[00:48:40] it was an amazing experience.
[00:48:42] But we would go out and you were on like a six day rotation.
[00:48:46] And, you know, you did two days in the fob,
[00:48:49] which was just out in the middle of the jungle.
[00:48:51] It was the Ford operating base.
[00:48:53] And then you would do two days on patrol.
[00:48:55] And then they'd bring you back for two days in the rear.
[00:48:58] And you were just on this rotation.
[00:48:59] And there was just a company of Marines down there.
[00:49:02] I was in Navy, Navy SEALs were down there.
[00:49:04] You know, they had Army folks down there.
[00:49:07] But that was our assignment.
[00:49:09] And I remember Al Gray, it was the commandant
[00:49:13] and I was in the fob.
[00:49:15] And I'm sitting in the fighting position.
[00:49:18] We had fighting positions around there.
[00:49:19] So I was, you know, man in the fighting positions,
[00:49:21] me and one other guy in the heat taps going down,
[00:49:23] it's getting dark.
[00:49:24] And we kind of concede like this entourage
[00:49:27] of people milling about the area.
[00:49:29] And it just not, it's not making too much sense of like,
[00:49:33] like who is this?
[00:49:34] Well, next thing you know, this older guy,
[00:49:36] I mean, it's a dark out.
[00:49:37] I really don't know who it is.
[00:49:39] Hops down in the fighting position with me.
[00:49:43] And he's like, hey, who are you?
[00:49:44] I was like, oh, J.D. Baker.
[00:49:47] You know what I mean?
[00:49:48] And he's like, oh, how's things going?
[00:49:50] I was like, who are you?
[00:49:52] I was like, Al Gray.
[00:49:54] And hmm, name sounds familiar.
[00:49:57] You know what I mean?
[00:49:58] Cause like, you know, Al Gray was just, you know,
[00:50:01] Al Gray Marine.
[00:50:02] I mean, that's just how he went by.
[00:50:05] And he was a prior enlisted, you know, infantry,
[00:50:09] made it all the way to Sergeant.
[00:50:10] And they thought he'd make a good officer.
[00:50:11] So they sent him to OCS and made his way up
[00:50:14] through the ranks from New Jersey.
[00:50:17] He was a baseball player.
[00:50:18] So he started asking me just, I mean,
[00:50:21] of anything going on, just asked me like,
[00:50:23] who are my parents?
[00:50:24] Like what's my dad do?
[00:50:26] What's my mom do?
[00:50:27] Kind of like the stuff how you and I,
[00:50:29] when we first got on, just started asking me
[00:50:30] those personal questions.
[00:50:32] And when I told him about my dad with baseball,
[00:50:34] he was like, you know, he like lit up like,
[00:50:37] cause he was like, you know,
[00:50:38] I played semi pro baseball up in New Jersey.
[00:50:41] They call, he was called the Pelican Pounder.
[00:50:44] He was a hell of an,
[00:50:46] Pelican Pounder.
[00:50:46] Yeah. He played for the Pelicans.
[00:50:48] It was semi pro team up there.
[00:50:50] And he literally, years later,
[00:50:52] I was up at his house in Alexandria
[00:50:53] and he's showing me the front page picture.
[00:50:56] He had the clipping, you know, the Pelican Pounder,
[00:50:58] Al Gray, which was pretty cool to see.
[00:51:01] So he was a big baseball guy.
[00:51:03] And for me being an E3, I was the last corporal
[00:51:06] at that time with the comment on the Marine Corps.
[00:51:09] I have now had a relationship with that guy for 35 years,
[00:51:15] which was just amazing.
[00:51:16] He was just a different.
[00:51:18] How did you stay in touch with him after that?
[00:51:21] He just reconnect with him later.
[00:51:22] He's always been around the Marine Corps.
[00:51:25] Like, you know, Al Gray has just,
[00:51:27] Oh, for sure.
[00:51:28] Yeah. I mean, he's just one of those guys like,
[00:51:30] we could be sitting in here doing this podcast.
[00:51:32] And next thing you know, he'd just show up.
[00:51:33] I mean, because that's how he was.
[00:51:35] It's like a comedot.
[00:51:36] He didn't tell people when he was going places.
[00:51:39] I mean, he just, his career was the first one
[00:51:42] to just take his official photo and camis.
[00:51:45] You know, the kind of guy that he was,
[00:51:50] that really had a big effect on me
[00:51:53] was when he was the Comedon of the Marine Corps
[00:51:56] on the weekend, he was out front of his Comedon's house
[00:51:59] at eighth and I, you know, down in Southeast DC.
[00:52:02] And he's out doing the gardening
[00:52:05] at the front of the house.
[00:52:06] And this elderly black woman that lived down the street
[00:52:11] was walking by and she was, you know, stopped and said,
[00:52:15] hello. And, you know, Al Gray was like, hey, how you doing?
[00:52:17] Didn't say like who he was.
[00:52:19] She just thought he was the gardener.
[00:52:21] And she's like, man, I've lived here in South DCC
[00:52:24] my entire life.
[00:52:25] And I've always wondered what it looks like
[00:52:28] on the inside of that house.
[00:52:30] So Al Gray was kind of like, interesting.
[00:52:33] So goes to a staff meeting on Monday
[00:52:35] and he's like, I'm having a garden party
[00:52:37] and I'm inviting all my neighbors.
[00:52:41] So they send out invitations to block radiuses all around.
[00:52:45] You know, eighth and I, and he's inviting,
[00:52:47] of course, you know, he's got staff guys going,
[00:52:49] okay, we're going to put a rope here.
[00:52:50] Let's take this thing down.
[00:52:51] I mean, cause they got a lot of like a
[00:52:52] Chesty pullers underwear in there or something.
[00:52:54] I don't want somebody to take, you know what I mean?
[00:52:56] Al Gray's like, no, man, these are my neighbors.
[00:52:59] Like, do you, like when your neighbors come over,
[00:53:02] do you put stuff away?
[00:53:03] Do you put ropes up and they're only allowed
[00:53:05] in certain sections of your house?
[00:53:07] These are my neighbors.
[00:53:08] And sure enough, man, he has his party
[00:53:11] and the neighbors are all coming in.
[00:53:12] And here's that elderly black woman comes in
[00:53:14] and who she meet at the door.
[00:53:16] Al Gray, she thought he was the gardener.
[00:53:19] And there he is.
[00:53:20] I mean, when they got done with the end of the event,
[00:53:22] not one thing was stolen, nothing broken.
[00:53:24] You know what I mean? And the Marines up at eighth and I
[00:53:27] weren't having any more problems out in town anymore
[00:53:29] with the neighbors in and around Southeast DC.
[00:53:31] It was just an extended hand of these are our neighbors.
[00:53:35] And that's kind of sums up of like who Al Gray is.
[00:53:39] So he had a huge effect on the Marine Corps
[00:53:43] just in that four year period of time.
[00:53:46] And I just got lucky enough to meet him in Panama in 89
[00:53:51] and just stayed in contact of it.
[00:53:55] And his memory is just like he could remember
[00:53:58] like exact dates, names of it.
[00:54:03] The guy's got a phenomenal memory
[00:54:05] and he was self-educated.
[00:54:08] You know what I mean?
[00:54:08] He was number one thing was the library.
[00:54:11] You know what I mean?
[00:54:12] Get a book, read it.
[00:54:13] And now Marine Corps has the reading list,
[00:54:16] which is kind of cool.
[00:54:17] We got a lot of cool books on there.
[00:54:19] You know what I mean?
[00:54:20] You go through the different grade levels
[00:54:22] and you can get books.
[00:54:23] And the Marine Corps was always really big
[00:54:26] into their history and big into the reading,
[00:54:28] which one that fell in line with me, love history,
[00:54:32] love the reading aspect of it.
[00:54:34] And reading, if this is gonna be your trade,
[00:54:36] if this is what you're gonna do,
[00:54:38] then you need to read a lot of books.
[00:54:41] And I had some other officers, one Eric Carlson,
[00:54:45] he told me to cast my net widely.
[00:54:48] Like don't just pigeonhole,
[00:54:51] like just don't read all military.
[00:54:54] You know what I mean?
[00:54:55] So cast your net widely so you get a different perspective
[00:55:00] on different things.
[00:55:01] And so that was pretty cool with Eric and casting my net.
[00:55:09] So I mean, I read from Danielle Steele,
[00:55:12] anything that I could get my hands on
[00:55:15] just to be able to read.
[00:55:17] And the imagination, Rudyard Kipling,
[00:55:21] Henry David Thoreau.
[00:55:23] I even read some theoretical physicists,
[00:55:26] the cork and the jaguar, which was like,
[00:55:29] that'd be a cool job to be like a theoretical fit,
[00:55:32] just like sitting in a room like this.
[00:55:34] And I just thank for eight hours of stuff and go back.
[00:55:39] But that was pretty cool.
[00:55:42] Where were you when the invasion went down in Panama?
[00:55:45] We were, the invasion, we were back,
[00:55:49] stay side because we were rotated in.
[00:55:51] You went down on a 90 day tour.
[00:55:54] You did a 90 day and then rotated back.
[00:55:58] So that was in 89.
[00:56:00] But that was also, I was a fire team leader.
[00:56:04] So that was like my first go around being a fire team leader.
[00:56:08] And that was probably my first realization,
[00:56:11] even though like nothing happened.
[00:56:14] Like we didn't get any gunfights while we were down there.
[00:56:16] There was events that were taking place, just me personally.
[00:56:19] I didn't have any events.
[00:56:22] But when you get issued live ammo
[00:56:25] and you take the BFA off, you know what I mean?
[00:56:28] It got real.
[00:56:30] Like then I was kind of like, okay,
[00:56:31] this isn't like camp anymore.
[00:56:34] You know what I mean?
[00:56:36] But being in triple canopy down there,
[00:56:38] and we went, they used to have Fort Sherman,
[00:56:41] the army base that was down there.
[00:56:42] And you'd go through jungle warfare
[00:56:45] and jungle survival, a phenomenal place.
[00:56:47] You know, when they take you down there,
[00:56:48] they got like this little zoo
[00:56:50] that they like show you the animals
[00:56:52] that you can encounter while you're there.
[00:56:55] It wasn't the Panamanian Defense Force
[00:56:57] that we were scared of.
[00:56:58] It was the creatures in that jungle.
[00:57:02] We're like seeing like the Anaconda.
[00:57:05] You know what I mean?
[00:57:06] I was like, that's a big snake.
[00:57:08] I was lucky when I was at SEAL Team One,
[00:57:10] we were like the designated Southeast Asia team.
[00:57:15] And so we were supposed to be ready for the jungle.
[00:57:17] And in our platoon workup, getting ready to deploy,
[00:57:20] we went and did like a month in Panama.
[00:57:22] We went to that zoo, all that stuff went through that,
[00:57:24] our army jungle survival training.
[00:57:29] I don't know if we went through like a full school,
[00:57:30] but it was like a couple, like a day and a half
[00:57:31] or something like this.
[00:57:32] They're showing you what to watch out for
[00:57:34] and all that kind of stuff, but it was awesome.
[00:57:37] You know, then we just went out
[00:57:38] and lived in the jungle for like a month.
[00:57:40] And we had a little base camp set up
[00:57:42] and we go out and do our training throughout the day.
[00:57:44] We would do occasion, we'd try and do night
[00:57:47] immediate action drills, which is like completely black.
[00:57:50] There's no night vision days, you know,
[00:57:51] just completely black running through the jungle,
[00:57:54] sending up a loom, you know, hitting trees
[00:57:57] with your loom by accident.
[00:57:58] Cause I was a radio missile, I was always firing a loom.
[00:58:01] It was freaking awesome.
[00:58:03] You get good when you spend that much time
[00:58:06] in the field, you get good at it.
[00:58:08] Yeah. And doing the three months down there,
[00:58:10] that's where I would say that I got good
[00:58:13] at being an infantryman.
[00:58:16] But it was, yeah, that's amazing.
[00:58:18] You're talking about like, you know, the,
[00:58:20] cause when it got dark,
[00:58:21] oh, it's, I mean,
[00:58:22] it's remember that the is black.
[00:58:24] Well, dude, you remember those MVGs we had back then
[00:58:27] to where it like the starlight scope to where, okay, well,
[00:58:29] one, it requires starlight.
[00:58:31] We didn't even use those down there.
[00:58:33] And then you'd be in the radio operators.
[00:58:35] I don't know what you got.
[00:58:36] But remember we had the 77s, the prick 77s, the 104s,
[00:58:40] you know what I mean to where like you had to be good.
[00:58:43] Oh yeah. You had to have skills.
[00:58:45] Yeah. I mean, it's a skill set to run.
[00:58:47] Like when I look at the communications
[00:58:49] that these folks have nowadays, it's like, wow,
[00:58:52] like trying to get a comm shot with a 77 or a 104 was,
[00:58:57] that's when the communicators had some serious skill sets
[00:59:02] to be able to manipulate and operate comm,
[00:59:04] especially down there.
[00:59:06] That was the first time is like being a team leader.
[00:59:08] I had to do like, you know, patrol overlays.
[00:59:12] So I had to, I had to get good at my job.
[00:59:15] And, and that I would say that that probably was the,
[00:59:19] the pinnacle of like those three months, but down there,
[00:59:22] that's when I became an infantryman.
[00:59:25] You know, as, as what we would call it,
[00:59:27] because in 0311 is you're a scout is basically,
[00:59:31] is pretty much what you are.
[00:59:33] And then that had a big effect on me as being a Marine
[00:59:39] of what's important as far as like training
[00:59:42] and education wise of becoming a professional
[00:59:45] infantryman was really big.
[00:59:47] So it's not too long after that,
[00:59:49] that the goal four starts heating up the first goal four.
[00:59:53] Yes.
[00:59:54] And so where, how do you, how do you slot into that?
[00:59:55] You're at one six now.
[00:59:57] Yeah. I'm same battalion.
[00:59:58] I was in Panama with, we got a new platoon start
[01:00:01] when we came back, that guy, his name was Eli Tucker.
[01:00:05] His nickname was Eli Tucker, the big motherfucker.
[01:00:09] Cause that dude was jacked, you know what I mean?
[01:00:12] And just ruthless, but a hell of an,
[01:00:14] he had a huge impact on me.
[01:00:17] He was a Sergeant E five, but that guy, when, when,
[01:00:21] when you, like, if you look up Marine infantrymen
[01:00:23] in the dictionary, it's Eli Tucker is in that book.
[01:00:27] He's just a phenomenal guy, both up and down the ladder.
[01:00:30] He pulled respect from the officers as well as,
[01:00:35] as any enlisted in that battalion.
[01:00:38] And, and so he was my platoon Sergeant.
[01:00:40] We were on, on deployment again over in the Far East.
[01:00:43] And we hopped in, we were in the Philippines and Noriega
[01:00:48] decided to add on to his, you know, Southern property.
[01:00:51] So he,
[01:00:52] Oh, you mean Saddam?
[01:00:53] Yeah, Saddam. I mean, yeah.
[01:00:54] So he takes over, he goes over, snatches up Kuwait.
[01:00:58] We're in the Philippines.
[01:00:59] They throw us on the USS broken.
[01:01:01] I was the Oganawa and we steam around and they kick us
[01:01:05] off the boat and we're in country right there coming
[01:01:08] in September.
[01:01:09] So it went down in August.
[01:01:11] They had us in.
[01:01:12] We were one of the first Marine battalions.
[01:01:15] They hit the ground in Saudi Arabia.
[01:01:18] And then it was just,
[01:01:20] So did you stay there the whole time?
[01:01:22] Yes.
[01:01:23] How long were, how long were you there for?
[01:01:24] Like seven and a half months.
[01:01:26] We, yeah, it was terrible. It was,
[01:01:30] Do you live in an tent in the desert?
[01:01:32] Basically,
[01:01:32] We didn't even have to test.
[01:01:33] Yeah. We had those radar scattering nets kind of things.
[01:01:36] So you just, you know, in a poncho.
[01:01:38] Yeah, we were just for,
[01:01:40] For how long did you live like that?
[01:01:42] We were out there for like over seven months.
[01:01:46] Yeah, it was terrible.
[01:01:47] And you had to have a cot, you know,
[01:01:49] those little green cots because the,
[01:01:50] the desert sand was just so hot.
[01:01:53] But the cool thing was about the battalion, you know,
[01:01:55] we kind of talked about earlier.
[01:01:57] My battalion commander was Lieutenant Colonel Jones.
[01:02:01] His, his initials were TC's.
[01:02:04] We called him too cool.
[01:02:06] And Jones was a phenomenal battalion commander.
[01:02:12] Jones with, with, he was the kind of guy
[01:02:15] that he'd like knew everybody in the battalion.
[01:02:18] He knew where you were from.
[01:02:19] He knew a little bit about, he was very personable.
[01:02:23] So, you know, and that was almost like every Marine battalions,
[01:02:27] their leadership were all Vietnam vets.
[01:02:31] So they knew what was important of what we needed to know.
[01:02:36] There wasn't, you know,
[01:02:38] and then you go up to the regimental level
[01:02:40] and then you've got Al Gray as the commandant.
[01:02:43] You know, you got Storm and Norman Swarshkoff,
[01:02:46] you know what I mean?
[01:02:47] Army commander and then joint chiefs.
[01:02:49] You got Colm Powell kind of run.
[01:02:51] So it's almost like the stars have aligned.
[01:02:55] You know, when some folks are like, yeah, Desert Storm was like,
[01:02:57] what, like 96 hours.
[01:02:59] There's a reason for that.
[01:03:01] Because of those guys are like, yeah,
[01:03:03] we're not doing this one again.
[01:03:05] And I mean, when, when we were, it was a long wait.
[01:03:09] That was a.
[01:03:09] And what are you doing while you're waiting?
[01:03:10] Just training every day, prepping, getting ready.
[01:03:13] Trying, yep.
[01:03:13] Trying on your gas mask.
[01:03:15] Trying on your gas mask again.
[01:03:16] Trying on your gas mask again.
[01:03:18] Did you get, were you guys hearing this casualty thing
[01:03:20] that I saw on CNN?
[01:03:21] Like, hey, there's going to be mass casualties.
[01:03:23] Were you expecting that?
[01:03:23] Were they briefing you on that?
[01:03:25] Yeah, they actually flew in a whole bunch of replacements
[01:03:29] right prior to the ground war kicking off.
[01:03:31] And we're like, what are these dudes doing here?
[01:03:33] You know what I mean?
[01:03:34] And they're like, oh, these are the replacement guys.
[01:03:36] You know what I mean?
[01:03:37] Of coming in.
[01:03:37] So, you know, I would probably say like,
[01:03:40] I got, I got really sick of the gas mask.
[01:03:43] But when they show you like photos and stuff of like
[01:03:46] what people look like with blister agent and like,
[01:03:50] that was like a, that was a real threat.
[01:03:52] Like everybody was like scared for those aspects
[01:03:55] of the chemical mines and arbitrage.
[01:03:57] And we had the mine belts of blowing the mine belts
[01:04:01] that were out there, which was interesting within itself.
[01:04:06] You know, when-
[01:04:07] So that was your mission?
[01:04:08] Yeah.
[01:04:09] Well, we had to get through those mine belts first.
[01:04:11] So there was two big mine belts.
[01:04:13] So we got the, we're all, everybody's mecked up.
[01:04:16] And you got the lines that can shoot over the back
[01:04:21] of the Amtrak's and detonate.
[01:04:24] And then it give you a kind of a lane kind of a thing
[01:04:26] to go through.
[01:04:28] Some of them worked, some of them didn't.
[01:04:29] So we had that, yeah, we had tanks that were there with us.
[01:04:33] The tanks that were attached to us.
[01:04:34] I remember their call sign,
[01:04:35] because it was public enemy, which was like a super,
[01:04:39] like you're going to be like a tank guy.
[01:04:41] That's like a, that's a cool.
[01:04:42] That's a great call sign.
[01:04:43] A great call sign, like public enemy.
[01:04:46] And you know, those guys would come through
[01:04:47] and push the plows.
[01:04:49] And just the air power, the amount of support
[01:04:53] and being an 0-311, like on the ground,
[01:04:56] I felt like I didn't even need a gun.
[01:04:59] I mean, the kitchen sink was being thrown at these folks.
[01:05:02] I mean, they were just, it was all on.
[01:05:05] It was like a live fire exercise.
[01:05:07] So when it kicked off, what was your platoon's mission?
[01:05:12] Breaching, getting through.
[01:05:14] And then they had like on the other side of the mine belts
[01:05:16] was defensive positions for the Iraqis.
[01:05:19] So we all had certain objectives that we kind of had to hit.
[01:05:23] And you know, just to get through the mine belts,
[01:05:25] they thought it would take like days for us
[01:05:28] to get through the mine belts, not a couple of hours.
[01:05:31] And then we had the Army's Tiger Brigade
[01:05:34] that was following up.
[01:05:35] They were the ones that were going to do the big left,
[01:05:38] the big left hook going up into Iraq with,
[01:05:40] I mean, I'd never seen so many Bradley's M1 Abrams.
[01:05:44] Cause remember that's when the M1 came out, the Abram,
[01:05:47] which that thing is, that's a bad ass piece of gear.
[01:05:51] And just, so we did the mine belts, they broke left,
[01:05:53] they start heading up to Iraq.
[01:05:55] And we're, when we hit the objectives
[01:05:59] for our company objectives.
[01:06:01] And so these are like little Iraqi positions.
[01:06:03] These were your company objectives.
[01:06:05] Was like little pill boxes or whatever.
[01:06:07] Yeah, if even that, I mean,
[01:06:09] they had been sitting out there for so,
[01:06:10] like we had these extravagant,
[01:06:12] like what we thought we were going to encounter.
[01:06:15] And then what we actually encountered were not the same.
[01:06:20] Like some couple of sandbags and a dude with an AK.
[01:06:22] Yeah, I mean, and they were like in living quarters.
[01:06:25] Like they had been out there so long, just like us.
[01:06:28] Like you're just trying to make your life comfortable.
[01:06:31] So get some plywood, you know what I mean?
[01:06:33] Dig a hole, put it over top of it.
[01:06:35] You know what I mean?
[01:06:36] Make a nice little area.
[01:06:37] You know, you can brew up ramen, you got your coffee,
[01:06:41] that kind of stuff.
[01:06:41] They're just basically out there living.
[01:06:43] And the frontline troops like weren't the Republican guard
[01:06:47] guys, they had those guys behind them to make sure
[01:06:49] that they didn't run away.
[01:06:52] And so, you know, as soon as you start coming through,
[01:06:54] it's basically we hit them and they were like,
[01:06:56] They were like flags.
[01:06:58] Oh yeah.
[01:06:59] I mean, because they were like,
[01:07:00] oh my God, they're here already.
[01:07:03] You know, like their coffee pot was like still warm.
[01:07:06] You know what I mean?
[01:07:07] When we rolled in and then it was just a Rolex.
[01:07:11] I mean, once we went through the, of course, you know,
[01:07:13] everybody, you know, you're scared.
[01:07:15] I mean, you know, when you're on the other side
[01:07:17] of the mind belts and they're dropping artillery
[01:07:19] and those sorts of things are coming on.
[01:07:21] So you can hear the explosions, you know,
[01:07:24] they set the oil fields on fire.
[01:07:27] So you've just got like that oil fields
[01:07:29] and the black smoke and all that kind of.
[01:07:31] So it's like.
[01:07:32] Were you freaking stoked?
[01:07:34] Like, yeah, to be there and just like hell yeah.
[01:07:38] Yeah.
[01:07:39] And then let's get the hell out of here.
[01:07:40] So then when, so how long did it take
[01:07:42] before you got your objective secured?
[01:07:44] And then what'd you do?
[01:07:46] Then we loaded up straight to Kuwait.
[01:07:48] I mean, and it was, it was just game on.
[01:07:50] I mean, we, we, we rolled it.
[01:07:52] That air war and that campaign that those folks did,
[01:07:56] unbelievable.
[01:07:57] I mean, it wasn't like a window pane left intact in Kuwait.
[01:08:02] I mean, they, they, they, like I said,
[01:08:04] they threw the kitchen sink at them.
[01:08:06] I mean, the air power above us, even with our,
[01:08:09] with our helicopter support, with Cobra's army,
[01:08:12] with their Apaches and then all the fast movers
[01:08:15] and stuff over there.
[01:08:16] I mean, they just, there was a lot of craters.
[01:08:19] That mile of death, cause I remember years later,
[01:08:22] probably like I think it was 93 or 94.
[01:08:25] I went to Kuwait and we were doing like training
[01:08:27] and we drove up the mile death and there's still vehicles
[01:08:29] all over the place that we just blasted.
[01:08:32] Oh yeah.
[01:08:33] And then, you know, then they, they want to make it look
[01:08:35] like the Kuwaitis like had a part in it.
[01:08:38] So then they're going to let them come back in
[01:08:40] and shoot into the air and yeah, we took our country back
[01:08:43] and all that kind of stuff.
[01:08:45] But yeah, that place was a wreck.
[01:08:47] It's amazing what it looks like now compared to,
[01:08:50] I mean, they, they, they, they took the wood to it.
[01:08:53] But it was, you know, of seeing that in 91
[01:08:57] and just seeing the, the amount of power
[01:09:00] the United States has is just unimaginable
[01:09:07] of what we can bring to bear.
[01:09:10] But I look at the commanders that were those senior command,
[01:09:12] you know, a few years later after that,
[01:09:14] I read Colin Powell's autobiography, phenomenal individual,
[01:09:18] phenomenal career.
[01:09:20] But I look at those guys in the, in the leadership positions
[01:09:23] of where they were and their careers
[01:09:26] of what they had gone through, coming out of Vietnam
[01:09:29] and seeing that kind of stuff.
[01:09:30] So when, you know, now it's their turn to go.
[01:09:35] I was very thankful for that.
[01:09:37] But even the battalion commanders, you know,
[01:09:40] them having combat experience, you know what I mean?
[01:09:43] It was, it was, it was a game changer for us
[01:09:46] to have somebody that, you know, directly looking out for you
[01:09:50] that's been there, done that and has the T-shirt
[01:09:52] and hat kind of aspect.
[01:09:54] And, and they know what Wright looks like.
[01:09:57] And the way they were as leaders, like I said,
[01:10:00] I mean, Tuchel Jones was, as the battalion commander,
[01:10:03] he was, you know, just phenomenal as a leader
[01:10:08] because he was personal.
[01:10:10] Like you felt like you had a relationship with the guy.
[01:10:14] And, and of course, you know, he always had,
[01:10:15] he loved sports, you know, it was big and with activities.
[01:10:19] So, you know, we had softball bats.
[01:10:20] I played third base for his, you know,
[01:10:22] for his battalion team, you know what I mean?
[01:10:24] So third base and, you know, I got an arm.
[01:10:27] You know what I mean?
[01:10:28] Love playing.
[01:10:29] Yeah, so it was like camp, you know what I mean?
[01:10:32] Again, but we're in the middle of the desert.
[01:10:36] Yeah, it's, it's, you know, you mentioned
[01:10:39] that you had these guys who were running the show.
[01:10:42] And, you know, when we just had this Afghanistan pull out,
[01:10:45] which is just a big disaster.
[01:10:46] And you look at the entire,
[01:10:47] the entire Afghanistan campaign and the Iraq campaign
[01:10:51] that took place when I was in.
[01:10:54] And, you know, did these people learn anything from Vietnam?
[01:11:00] And then you look at how those guys handled the first Gulf War.
[01:11:03] It's like, you know, they learned something from Vietnam.
[01:11:05] Like, we're not going to do it like that.
[01:11:07] We're going to go in there with overwhelming force.
[01:11:10] I mean, overwhelming times five.
[01:11:13] Like there's nothing's going to stop us.
[01:11:15] And we're going to end up doing this in three days.
[01:11:17] That's what's going to happen.
[01:11:19] And like you said, people go to those only 96 hours.
[01:11:22] It's like, yes, exactly.
[01:11:26] Yeah, I'm thankful for that.
[01:11:28] You know, and, and that was a huge turn of point.
[01:11:33] Of course, by then, you know, then I had known
[01:11:37] when I came back that, you know, the Marine Corps,
[01:11:40] this is, this is what I'm going to,
[01:11:41] this is what I'm going to do.
[01:11:42] I've got, you know, three deployments.
[01:11:45] And then, you know, then they're looking at,
[01:11:47] now you got to kind of diversify yourself a little bit.
[01:11:51] So when I came back and I was a corporal.
[01:11:54] Did you guys come back on a ship?
[01:11:55] How'd you guys get back?
[01:11:56] How'd you guys get back to America?
[01:11:58] Because we were the first in.
[01:12:00] We got to be the first out.
[01:12:01] And there was a call of all airlines worldwide
[01:12:05] to come in to pick up troops to get them home.
[01:12:07] We flew Hawaiian Airlines, which was,
[01:12:12] which was pretty banging.
[01:12:13] You know what I mean?
[01:12:14] Being out, being gone for over nine months, you know,
[01:12:16] total because we were already on deployment
[01:12:18] and got Taggurit.
[01:12:20] And, you know, getting on the, on the big freedom birds
[01:12:24] and we landed in, we flew over, we landed in,
[01:12:29] in Ireland to refuel.
[01:12:32] And then we landed in Maine.
[01:12:35] And when we landed in Maine, they let us get off the planes
[01:12:38] and we all came back in and we were like the first,
[01:12:41] like troops back to hit US soil in Maine.
[01:12:45] And man, the airport was, the walls were lined
[01:12:50] with just, it seemed like the whole state of Maine
[01:12:52] was at the airport.
[01:12:54] You know what I mean?
[01:12:55] Flags, they had tables out, food.
[01:12:58] And, you know, the battalion commander, you know,
[01:13:01] he's like, meet me at the bar.
[01:13:03] And, you know, we go to the bar here.
[01:13:05] It's probably not the smartest thing to do when, you know,
[01:13:07] you've been sober for nine months
[01:13:09] and now we're all going to go to the bar.
[01:13:12] And, but I mean, the people in Maine,
[01:13:14] for them coming out was huge.
[01:13:16] The support that we got coming back after that was amazing.
[01:13:21] So we're there, they refuel, they put us back on the bird
[01:13:25] and, you know, the stewardess just had to lock themselves
[01:13:28] away because you got a bunch of stupid Marines
[01:13:32] that have had a lot to drink.
[01:13:33] You know, they got the little no smoking lamps coming on.
[01:13:35] Dudes are burning cigarettes.
[01:13:37] You know, there's no shits given.
[01:13:39] We get down to Cherry Point and the bands down there,
[01:13:43] I mean, they're throwing 12 packs and beer
[01:13:46] on the back of the five tons.
[01:13:48] We're going back down to Lejeune.
[01:13:50] It was, I mean, it was a great, great homecoming
[01:13:54] to be able to come back.
[01:13:56] And it was, it was phenomenal for that experience.
[01:14:03] And then I had to decide what I'm going to do next.
[01:14:06] And I had one of my best friends, Doug Barry.
[01:14:10] He lives just up the road here in San Diego.
[01:14:13] We were together in First Battalion, six Marines.
[01:14:17] And we both went over to await orders to go to the drill
[01:14:21] field to become a drill instructor.
[01:14:25] And just because, you know, I mean, the Marine Corps,
[01:14:27] like the DI is a very iconic figure.
[01:14:32] But the bigger reason is, is back then,
[01:14:36] you only had to do two years on the drill field.
[01:14:39] But if you went recruiting, you had to do three.
[01:14:43] Well, the only thing I knew was I did not want
[01:14:46] to be a recruiter.
[01:14:47] Like that, you know, God bless them.
[01:14:50] You know what I mean?
[01:14:51] We've got the school right here at MCRD
[01:14:54] for Marine Corps of Recruiting.
[01:14:55] And the guys are great at their job.
[01:14:57] You know, the Marines put on the, you know,
[01:14:59] the uniform, the way they look, the way they recruit.
[01:15:02] I mean, we can propaganda with the best of them out there.
[01:15:05] And so I wanted to go do the DI thing,
[01:15:08] get the funny hat.
[01:15:10] Plus it, you know, it would be fun.
[01:15:13] And it was.
[01:15:15] So how long is drill instructor school?
[01:15:18] It's like three months.
[01:15:19] It's kind of like you're going through boot camp,
[01:15:20] but you got rank.
[01:15:24] I imagine though, they must be like even harder
[01:15:26] in boot than boot camp in some ways.
[01:15:28] Cause you got to be so like perfect with everything.
[01:15:32] Yeah. And it's learning like the drill manual verbatim.
[01:15:37] It's the, from the mannerisms to just the command presence.
[01:15:42] They teach you that.
[01:15:44] Oh, can they take a guy that doesn't have any command
[01:15:46] presence and they teach it to him?
[01:15:48] Oh yeah. I mean, you're going to stand out there
[01:15:50] and yell at a lot of trees.
[01:15:51] You know what I mean?
[01:15:52] It's like, if you ever go down there
[01:15:54] and you like watch DI school and they're going through
[01:15:56] DI school, you'll see dudes like,
[01:15:58] what is he doing yelling?
[01:15:59] And then he's just, what, at a tree.
[01:16:02] Well, he's doing what's like, it's called a teach back
[01:16:04] where you have to verbatim.
[01:16:06] You know what I mean?
[01:16:07] Like go back through for the different moves of drill.
[01:16:12] And then, you know, from your mannerisms,
[01:16:14] how you dress, how you look, your professionalism
[01:16:18] of coming in is it is, it's a difficult school.
[01:16:23] The uniforms are just, I mean, that's next level.
[01:16:28] Because I wasn't like the best uniform guy.
[01:16:30] You know what I mean?
[01:16:31] Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't like, I didn't even own dress blues.
[01:16:35] Like, cause you had to buy them back then if you wanted them.
[01:16:37] And I was like, why don't I want to buy them?
[01:16:40] You know what I mean?
[01:16:41] I like the alphas, the greens.
[01:16:44] So I just had alphas.
[01:16:45] I never had the blues.
[01:16:46] They didn't issue them to me.
[01:16:47] And you know what I mean?
[01:16:48] I'm cool with that.
[01:16:49] I didn't join to get dressed blues.
[01:16:52] I joined for the camis and the rifle free ammo,
[01:16:55] that kind of stuff, travel the world.
[01:16:57] So when I got there, the uniforms were difficult.
[01:16:59] The PT was really good, but it was,
[01:17:02] it was more of the structure of everything
[01:17:04] that they do to you at the iSchool.
[01:17:06] You can use it when you become a drill instructor.
[01:17:09] So they're going to do stuff to you
[01:17:10] that then you can turn around and.
[01:17:12] Mark what?
[01:17:14] Like on the training schedule of like,
[01:17:16] of probably the biggest misconception of Marine Corps
[01:17:22] and boot camps, everybody thinks it's like hands on.
[01:17:26] Like, you know, oh, you're going to get beat.
[01:17:28] They're going to put their hands on.
[01:17:28] I mean like physically.
[01:17:29] Physically.
[01:17:30] Yeah. I mean, and you learn there that,
[01:17:32] you know, you don't have to hit them to hurt them.
[01:17:35] You know what I mean?
[01:17:36] It's a one arms distance.
[01:17:37] Nothing has changed.
[01:17:39] If you need to put your hands on somebody,
[01:17:42] then you've lost leadership.
[01:17:44] You know what I mean?
[01:17:45] If you have to go to the physical force,
[01:17:48] but you know, just in your mannerism
[01:17:50] and the shock and awe of just the voice
[01:17:54] can just intimidate people.
[01:17:57] It's mainly as your voice, the smoky brings a lot to bear.
[01:18:01] And then just your physical fitness level.
[01:18:05] You know what I mean?
[01:18:05] Cause as a recruit, you're like,
[01:18:06] this guy like sweat.
[01:18:08] Like this guy doesn't get tired.
[01:18:10] I mean, these guys are just animals.
[01:18:13] And it is, it's a lot of, it's a lot of hard work.
[01:18:16] It's a lot of long hours,
[01:18:19] but it is very rewarding when,
[01:18:23] when you get the recruits have come in and it's fun.
[01:18:27] Cause now you're like a live character on Saturday Night Live.
[01:18:30] I mean, some of the stuff,
[01:18:31] that's why you got the big smoky.
[01:18:33] And so you can drop it so they can't see you laughing.
[01:18:36] Because I mean, some of the stuff that you see
[01:18:39] that recruits do, you know, I was like,
[01:18:41] yeah, I'd be with some of the other hats
[01:18:42] cause that's what you call a DI hat.
[01:18:45] And I, you'd be one of the hats was like,
[01:18:46] dude, there's no way I was this stupid when I was here.
[01:18:48] And you're like, yeah, you were,
[01:18:50] you were just as dumb as these kids are that are coming in.
[01:18:54] And they just do funny, they do funny stuff.
[01:18:57] And then as, as a drill instructor, when,
[01:19:00] when you get these kids on the yellow footprints
[01:19:03] and then in a three month period,
[01:19:06] when their parents come down for graduation
[01:19:09] and you're marching them up there
[01:19:10] and it's parents day, Thursday afternoon at Paris Island.
[01:19:14] And, and all the parents are excited to see their kids.
[01:19:17] Excuse me.
[01:19:18] And when the parents have to come over and ask you like,
[01:19:23] which one's mine?
[01:19:26] You know what I mean?
[01:19:27] Looking at them like,
[01:19:28] did you've had that kid for like 18 years
[01:19:30] and you don't know which one's yours?
[01:19:33] You know, the transformation when they get to go out
[01:19:35] with their parents, the drill instructors get to meet
[01:19:38] the parents that night when they bring the kids back
[01:19:41] to the squad bay.
[01:19:42] And the parents are just like,
[01:19:44] how did you do this in three months?
[01:19:46] He's saying, yes, sir, yes, man,
[01:19:48] he's holding doors open, like he's sitting up straight
[01:19:51] at the table.
[01:19:52] You know what I mean?
[01:19:53] Like what you all did to this,
[01:19:54] who our son is just incredible.
[01:19:57] It's a great weight loss program.
[01:20:00] You know what I mean?
[01:20:01] Like folks show up, you know what I mean?
[01:20:02] They look like a sea bag with lips,
[01:20:04] chewed up bubble gum and you know what I mean?
[01:20:06] Three months later, they're fighting lava monsters.
[01:20:08] I mean, they look like they're straight out of 300.
[01:20:13] And so that's very rewarding of seeing some of those,
[01:20:17] some of those kids just, and you know,
[01:20:19] in the Marine Corps, man,
[01:20:20] we then we're gonna put that emblem on them
[01:20:21] for the rest of their life.
[01:20:22] I mean, they've joined a great institution.
[01:20:26] You know, once a Marine, always a Marine,
[01:20:28] you know, we're gonna bring the families in.
[01:20:31] We're gonna mom, dad, they're gonna buy the t-shirts,
[01:20:34] the hats, they're gonna fly the flags.
[01:20:37] The Marine Corps does a, in my opinion,
[01:20:39] we do a really good job of bringing in the entire family.
[01:20:43] Like, you know, I mean,
[01:20:44] you'll see the stickers on the backs of cars,
[01:20:46] my son's a US Marine, my daughter's a US Marine.
[01:20:50] I mean, we got my grandson,
[01:20:53] I mean, we bring in the whole family
[01:20:56] to support that kid while he's, you know,
[01:20:58] to service to country, which is huge.
[01:21:00] When you're a drill instructor,
[01:21:01] or you're a drill instructor at school,
[01:21:04] are they talking you through sort of like
[01:21:06] the psychological why behind this aspect of training
[01:21:11] or this aspect of treatment?
[01:21:13] For instance, when I went to OCS,
[01:21:15] you know, I had Marine Corps drill instructor,
[01:21:16] awesome guy, awesome drill instructor,
[01:21:20] but at some point he told us stuff at the end, you know,
[01:21:24] and it was, honestly, I think I was asking a lot of questions
[01:21:26] because I wanted to understand better,
[01:21:28] but for instance, when you get to OCS,
[01:21:30] you can't look at your food.
[01:21:32] You have to, they call it squaring your meals.
[01:21:35] And I was like, hey, what, why are we doing that?
[01:21:37] And he goes, well, that comes from when we treat,
[01:21:40] when we used to just train pilots,
[01:21:42] they had to learn to use their peripheral vision
[01:21:44] so they could see their instruments
[01:21:45] while they're looking around.
[01:21:46] Okay, that makes sense.
[01:21:47] Hey, why do we gotta yell at you?
[01:21:48] Cause you gotta speak in a ballistic tone,
[01:21:50] which means you gotta yell everything.
[01:21:51] I'm like, what's the reason behind that?
[01:21:54] He says, well, you know, we get these young ensigns in here
[01:21:56] that are going to go on, be on board a ship,
[01:21:58] they're gonna be on the bridge,
[01:22:00] and they're gonna have to give orders on the bridge
[01:22:02] in a simple, clear, concise manner.
[01:22:04] They can't be hesitant.
[01:22:06] They gotta think before they say,
[01:22:07] but then they gotta say it with a commanding voice
[01:22:08] so that people actually hear them and then can execute.
[01:22:12] So there's things going on
[01:22:14] that there's a pragmatic reason behind,
[01:22:17] but did they ever break that down for you?
[01:22:19] For instance, you know, you can go watch on YouTube,
[01:22:21] you can go watch like the Welcome Abored,
[01:22:24] not like the first night,
[01:22:26] but maybe it's the second day
[01:22:27] where the Marines, they have a very preplanned script
[01:22:31] that they're saying about, you know,
[01:22:33] this is the Marine Corps, this is what we're doing.
[01:22:36] Do they break stuff down at a psychological level for you?
[01:22:41] Because what you just said about the Marine Corps
[01:22:43] doing it very well, I mean, I don't know if there's anyone
[01:22:46] that does it better than the Marine Corps.
[01:22:48] I mean, in the world, I don't know if there's any group
[01:22:51] that has a stronger culture than the Marine Corps
[01:22:56] that takes normal human beings from literally everywhere
[01:23:00] and every strata of the United States of America
[01:23:02] and sometimes other parts of the world
[01:23:04] and turns them into this cohesive unit.
[01:23:08] I don't know if there's anyone
[01:23:09] that does it better, but do they break it down?
[01:23:12] Do they say, hey, here's the reason why we do this right here?
[01:23:15] Like even basic SEAL training, you know, they're like,
[01:23:18] oh, what is Hell Week for?
[01:23:21] What is it for?
[01:23:22] And there's people that can answer that question,
[01:23:23] well, here's what's gonna happen.
[01:23:25] You know, this is what you're gonna have guys
[01:23:27] that are gonna quit on the second day
[01:23:30] and those are the people that blah, blah,
[01:23:31] and they've done all this sort of psychological background
[01:23:34] on it.
[01:23:35] Is there anything like that when you become a Marine Corps
[01:23:38] drill instructor that you understand the why?
[01:23:41] Or is it just this is what we know works?
[01:23:46] Yeah, a lot of it has to do with this is what works,
[01:23:50] but at the same time, everything is done, like you said,
[01:23:53] that you have squaring your meals.
[01:23:55] Like everything is for a reason.
[01:23:58] And it's also, you know, when we hand this recruit over
[01:24:01] to this, you know, commissioned officer,
[01:24:04] it's instant obedience to orders.
[01:24:06] I mean, these guys, they're, I mean,
[01:24:09] they do it better than anybody.
[01:24:12] For instance, obedience, but when you talk about like
[01:24:15] the psychological aspects, I was also, I was a swim hat.
[01:24:19] So I was a Marine Combat Instructor water survival.
[01:24:21] So I was a swim instructor, basically, for the Marine Corps.
[01:24:26] And, you know, because of the kids that we recruit
[01:24:31] like myself, they can't put that Marine has something
[01:24:34] to do with aquatics in it for some reason.
[01:24:36] You know what I mean?
[01:24:37] Like the recruiters don't like let them know
[01:24:38] that, hey, when you get down there, you got to swim.
[01:24:42] I mean, we get, like you said, I mean,
[01:24:44] we get kids from all over the planet
[01:24:46] that have never, the largest body of water
[01:24:48] they've ever seen is the pool tank
[01:24:50] at Parris Island, South Carolina.
[01:24:52] I mean, they've never been in a body of water that big.
[01:24:56] And we don't ask them if they can swim.
[01:24:59] Like nobody's, you know, the drill instructor
[01:25:01] doesn't come out, hey, anybody not swim?
[01:25:03] You can stand over here to the side.
[01:25:04] We just, you know, strap their gear on them
[01:25:06] you know what I mean?
[01:25:07] So give them a rifle, put a helmet on them.
[01:25:09] They're wearing their boots and they're all like, you know,
[01:25:12] A to B, right next to the 10 foot tower
[01:25:15] and we're going to give them the swim brief
[01:25:17] and we're going to take them up on the 10 foot tower
[01:25:20] and ask them to take a 30 inch step
[01:25:22] and do the deep end and swim 25 meters.
[01:25:25] And when you're sitting there, look,
[01:25:27] you know who the recruits are that can't swim.
[01:25:30] Because they're probably looking around going,
[01:25:32] is anybody going to ask?
[01:25:34] Like nobody there is not going to ask.
[01:25:36] And when you look at it,
[01:25:37] is we just want to see if they're going to step.
[01:25:40] If they can overcome fear, you know,
[01:25:43] if an individual can't overcome the fear or trust,
[01:25:47] I mean, there's a drill instructor in the water
[01:25:51] waiting for you like no one has drowned in this trend.
[01:25:55] Like it's, you know, it's the instructors
[01:25:57] that are there, very professional, very well run.
[01:26:01] And when you see this young man or young woman,
[01:26:04] you know what I mean?
[01:26:05] They're going to bounce the tower that knows
[01:26:06] that they can't swim a day in their life.
[01:26:09] And but they're going to trust the instructors
[01:26:12] and the Marine Corps that we're going to take care of you.
[01:26:16] They just have to step 30 inch step.
[01:26:18] They hit the water, they come up, you know,
[01:26:19] they're throwing up stuff from the third grade.
[01:26:21] They got snot coming out.
[01:26:22] They're straight to the,
[01:26:23] they don't even make it even close to swimming at all.
[01:26:27] They're just a rock in the water.
[01:26:29] We take them over to the side.
[01:26:30] We strip them all the way down into their, you know,
[01:26:32] their PT shorts and we take them down to the shallow end
[01:26:37] and we teach them how to swim.
[01:26:39] You know what I mean?
[01:26:40] It's a life skill.
[01:26:42] And, you know, there's nothing greater than when you're,
[01:26:45] you know, because, and it's not necessarily, you know,
[01:26:46] maybe their parents just,
[01:26:49] we don't know their background,
[01:26:50] how they were raised like for me.
[01:26:51] I don't remember learning how to swim.
[01:26:53] I could just swim.
[01:26:55] You know, a lot of those kids just don't have that advantage
[01:26:58] and we take them down there to the shallow end of the pool
[01:27:00] and we teach them the survival strokes.
[01:27:03] And in a couple of weeks, you know,
[01:27:04] like if they've got different training,
[01:27:06] they got to come back to the pool and do remediation
[01:27:09] until we can get them to pass and they can swim.
[01:27:11] When you see the confidence level in a kid,
[01:27:14] now that he can like swim and he passed that,
[01:27:17] I mean, this guy's going to go through brick walls.
[01:27:20] His fear is gone.
[01:27:22] You know, there's nothing this kid cannot accomplish now.
[01:27:26] I mean, it's just amazing.
[01:27:27] You could see it in them.
[01:27:28] I mean, you know, if you've ever like seen someone,
[01:27:30] they accomplished something just of a small task
[01:27:33] of like swimming 25 meters.
[01:27:35] Like it's really not that big of a deal.
[01:27:38] But to that kid, huge life changing event.
[01:27:42] How often, what's the attrition rate
[01:27:44] of Marine Corps boot camp?
[01:27:48] Ah, you know.
[01:27:50] How many guys would you lose, you know,
[01:27:52] what are you in charge of there?
[01:27:54] A platoon?
[01:27:55] Yeah, so you got a platoon.
[01:27:56] So, you know, depending on the time of the year,
[01:27:58] you might have, you know, between 50 to 70 kids
[01:28:01] that are in a platoon and you might lose 15 to 20 of them.
[01:28:05] But a lot of them, you know, it's injuries.
[01:28:06] So they're going to get recycled out.
[01:28:08] Yeah, they're just going to get recycled and rolled.
[01:28:11] They go to what, like if you come in, like, you know,
[01:28:14] when you first get down there, you know,
[01:28:16] and it's no offense to recruiters or anything like that,
[01:28:19] but you know, the kids are supposed to be able to have
[01:28:21] completed somewhat of a physical task prior to coming.
[01:28:24] So they can at least like pull themselves up
[01:28:27] out of a wet paper bag at least like once
[01:28:30] before they get there.
[01:28:32] You know, it's that whole preparation thing.
[01:28:34] And some of the kids, you know, we send them
[01:28:36] to PCP physical conditioning platoon
[01:28:38] because some of them show up.
[01:28:40] And they're just not really prepared.
[01:28:42] And when you kind of look at that, it's not really the kid.
[01:28:45] You know, the kid just read a pamphlet, you know what I mean?
[01:28:47] He wants to come in and that's somebody's son or daughter.
[01:28:53] You know what I mean?
[01:28:54] That they think that's the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[01:28:56] You know, to be a Marine, I mean,
[01:28:58] you only got to do three pull ups.
[01:29:00] I mean, you only got to run three miles and 28 minutes.
[01:29:02] I mean, it's not like we're, we're banging it, you know,
[01:29:05] in the main of like something that's just like
[01:29:06] incredibly difficult, but to some people,
[01:29:10] three pull ups is that's the most I've ever done
[01:29:12] in their life.
[01:29:13] And so, you know, we've got those,
[01:29:15] we've got medical rehabilitation platoon.
[01:29:17] So if the guys get rolled back, it's very rare.
[01:29:21] You know what I mean?
[01:29:22] Like you can try to drop.
[01:29:23] I mean, we do drop kids that get sent off the island
[01:29:26] and it's just because they're just not conforming.
[01:29:29] What about just straight quitters?
[01:29:30] Like it's cold or it's hot or it's too far.
[01:29:34] You're going to send them down.
[01:29:35] Everybody's got like a series commander.
[01:29:38] So you have an officer to kind of keep a look over
[01:29:41] what's happening in cell block.
[01:29:43] You know what I mean?
[01:29:44] And they have to go down and they'll get an interview
[01:29:46] with that, you know, a Marine captain.
[01:29:50] He's a series commander and he's going to try to talk
[01:29:52] that kid in to stay in.
[01:29:53] Like, hey, you know what, man?
[01:29:54] The drill starts really aren't that bad.
[01:29:56] You know what I mean?
[01:29:57] Because it's all a numbers game.
[01:29:58] You know what I mean?
[01:29:59] Like in the end, the Marine Corps needs
[01:30:01] a certain amount of numbers.
[01:30:03] So he's going to try to talk the kid back in.
[01:30:05] And that's like a lot of times with the platoon commander
[01:30:07] or the, you know, the series commanders
[01:30:08] that you have down there, you're like,
[01:30:10] you got to be shit me, sir.
[01:30:12] You're going to send this kid back.
[01:30:13] Man, like, God, you know, this guy is just,
[01:30:16] this kid's incredible.
[01:30:18] And he's just like, you just work with him.
[01:30:20] You know what I mean?
[01:30:21] Just, you know, leadership challenge.
[01:30:23] I hate that.
[01:30:23] You know what I mean?
[01:30:24] Like, that's the last thing I need
[01:30:26] in the middle of bootcamp is my leadership challenge.
[01:30:28] But in the end, I mean, you know,
[01:30:31] for the most part one, when you look at it,
[01:30:33] they're joining the United States Marine Corps.
[01:30:36] So you look across America, like, who else is joining?
[01:30:40] You know what I mean?
[01:30:40] So at least the kid signed on a dotted line
[01:30:43] and he's going to come and provide service to his country.
[01:30:46] Which is, that's pretty incredible.
[01:30:49] Just in that aspect.
[01:30:52] But some of them just, you know, psychologically,
[01:30:54] they just, they're not mentally tough enough
[01:30:57] and they're going to do whatever it takes
[01:30:59] to get off of that island.
[01:31:01] And we're going to do whatever it takes
[01:31:03] to help them get off of that island.
[01:31:06] You know, it's a lot of fun.
[01:31:10] But, you know, the rifle range is usually
[01:31:14] a pretty big deal, you know, every brain's a rifleman.
[01:31:17] But, you know, we're just looking, you know, marksmen.
[01:31:19] How many can get across the qualification lines?
[01:31:22] That kind of thing.
[01:31:23] So the marksmanship package, you know what I mean?
[01:31:24] There's a two week package down there.
[01:31:26] I think it's pretty good.
[01:31:27] It's a pretty good marksmanship package
[01:31:28] that the Marine Corps puts on.
[01:31:30] You know, for us shooting them back at 500
[01:31:32] with, you know, Green Tip 556, that's not great ammo.
[01:31:36] It's a pretty big accomplishment.
[01:31:38] And then, you know, just the aspects
[01:31:40] of when those kids graduate from Parris Island.
[01:31:44] You know what I mean?
[01:31:45] They look like they're ready to just strap on the world.
[01:31:48] And a three month period, you know,
[01:31:51] they're really not any tougher
[01:31:54] than they were three months before when they got there.
[01:31:57] But their mindset is different.
[01:32:01] I would say that that's probably the biggest thing.
[01:32:03] We just, we changed their mindset.
[01:32:05] And hopefully we're making a better product for America.
[01:32:09] When the kids go back home, if they get out,
[01:32:11] hopefully we're putting a better product back
[01:32:14] into society after serving in the Marines.
[01:32:17] And, you know, I would say the majority,
[01:32:19] we're doing a pretty good job.
[01:32:20] But I would say that for pretty much all the armed services.
[01:32:24] The instant obedience to orders,
[01:32:27] when do you get the, in the Marine Corps,
[01:32:32] you know, Marine Corps was like,
[01:32:34] we already talked about all gray and the enlightenment,
[01:32:36] the second enlightenment of the Marine Corps,
[01:32:38] which is, hey, we want people to think,
[01:32:39] we want to have, you know, mission type orders
[01:32:42] and those kind of things.
[01:32:43] At what point do you go from, all right,
[01:32:46] I'm a robot, I'm going to obey the orders
[01:32:48] that are given to me to hold on a second boss.
[01:32:50] Here's what my thoughts are.
[01:32:51] Yeah, usually when you're getting
[01:32:53] the non-commissioned officer,
[01:32:54] when you step into that team leader role, you know what I mean?
[01:32:57] And then you're, you know, you're reading assignment.
[01:32:59] Usually, I don't know if it's still to this day,
[01:33:03] but you know, reading message to Garcia, you know what I mean?
[01:33:06] Just getting them on those little interests
[01:33:09] of starting to thank on their own, you know what I mean?
[01:33:12] And not necessarily like everything
[01:33:14] has to come from a book, like everything very set in stone.
[01:33:20] You know what I mean?
[01:33:20] So when Al Gray, you know, brings in these, you know,
[01:33:23] the war fighting publications, yeah, it's starting to,
[01:33:27] it's kind of liberating that you can,
[01:33:31] now there's not a problem with like questioning authority.
[01:33:35] It's basically, you're not really, you're just asking why,
[01:33:37] like what's the why in it?
[01:33:39] Like why are we here?
[01:33:41] Why are we doing it this way?
[01:33:43] Is it just because you're telling me to,
[01:33:45] you know what I mean?
[01:33:46] Or is there actually some, you know, method to the madness?
[01:33:51] So I would say, you know,
[01:33:52] once you get into that team leader kind of role and NCO,
[01:33:55] you know, the non-commissioned officer, you know,
[01:33:58] that's when, you know, we're gonna start,
[01:33:59] you need to start thinking on your own.
[01:34:01] You need to start taking charge.
[01:34:03] It's not that instant obedience to orders.
[01:34:05] And, you know, if you see something that's not right,
[01:34:08] then, you know, bring that up.
[01:34:10] And you shouldn't be worried about the repercussions
[01:34:13] of questioning.
[01:34:15] You know, now there are some that don't like to be questioned.
[01:34:18] So of course, you know, there's that aspect of it,
[01:34:22] but that's in any organization.
[01:34:24] Any organization has those kind of jerks.
[01:34:27] So you get done with, what happens when you get done
[01:34:31] with your time at drill instructor school?
[01:34:32] You go back to one sex?
[01:34:33] Yep, go right back.
[01:34:35] First, it didn't want to have to buy new t-shirts and stuff.
[01:34:37] So I figured, hey man, yeah, I call the monitor.
[01:34:39] Let's go right back to 1st Battalion 6 Marines.
[01:34:42] Went back there.
[01:34:44] And now I'm stepping into that like platoon sergeant
[01:34:48] kind of thing, the Eli Tucker of my career.
[01:34:54] And that-
[01:34:55] You mentioned to me one time we were talking
[01:34:57] and you were like, oh, some guys had a hard time
[01:35:00] taking off their DI hat, meaning they come from
[01:35:03] the drill field where they're yelling and screaming
[01:35:05] and expect to be treated basically like a god.
[01:35:09] And now they're back in a platoon and it's like,
[01:35:11] they keep acting like that and it can be a problem.
[01:35:14] Yeah, I mean, now I don't want the fellow drill instructors
[01:35:18] out there to take offense, but the Marine drill instructor
[01:35:21] is you're just the lowest paid actor.
[01:35:24] I mean, it is an acting job.
[01:35:27] I mean, you're putting on a, it's a show.
[01:35:32] And some of them be like, oh, they don't agree with that.
[01:35:34] Well, if I'm like the third hat, I have a certain way
[01:35:38] that they want me to act as a third hat.
[01:35:39] If I'm the heavy, you know what I mean?
[01:35:42] The second hat, the J of what they call third hat.
[01:35:45] The third hat, you're like Nick the new hat.
[01:35:47] You just graduated from school.
[01:35:48] Literally, you might as well just get a laundry number
[01:35:50] and stay with the recruits
[01:35:51] because you don't know what you're doing.
[01:35:53] You know what I mean?
[01:35:54] So you just run around and they're like, hey,
[01:35:56] they'd be like, hey dog, you need to get louder
[01:35:59] and you need to get faster.
[01:36:00] Yeah, everything that you're doing is not fast enough.
[01:36:03] It's not loud enough.
[01:36:04] It's not, you know what I mean?
[01:36:05] So you're running around and you're trying to be that,
[01:36:08] that sand flee the word,
[01:36:10] you're just never letting these kids get a break.
[01:36:14] The heavy like the, he's the senior green belt in the platoon
[01:36:20] and he's teaching them everything drill,
[01:36:23] teaching them squad bay procedures.
[01:36:25] You know what I mean?
[01:36:26] He's very firm.
[01:36:26] Like the heavies, the guy that's the most experienced
[01:36:29] drill instructor, he's the one as a recruit
[01:36:31] you don't mess with.
[01:36:32] This guy, he knows the drill.
[01:36:35] He's very good at his job.
[01:36:37] And then you got like the senior drill instructor
[01:36:39] that wears the black belt.
[01:36:40] He's like dad.
[01:36:41] You know what I mean?
[01:36:42] Like he comes in, he hands out mail, he's nicer to you.
[01:36:46] And these are all stated roles?
[01:36:49] Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, if you're like the third hat,
[01:36:52] like the new guy and you're in there like big daddy
[01:36:55] and the recruits and handing out candy to them.
[01:36:57] Yeah, you're not gonna go over well with your peers.
[01:37:00] You know what I mean?
[01:37:01] They're gonna, you know, it's that peer pressure
[01:37:03] of how you're kind of of what role you play in the platoon.
[01:37:09] So, you know, some of the folks when you leave the drill field
[01:37:13] and you go back to the fleet Marine force,
[01:37:15] some of the folks, they like, they wear that smokey.
[01:37:19] They wanna, they wanna wear it in the fleet.
[01:37:22] And a lot of folks are like, look dude,
[01:37:25] we're not in boot camp anymore.
[01:37:28] And you know what I mean?
[01:37:29] You need to leave that hat on the island.
[01:37:31] But, you know, when you do come back and, you know,
[01:37:36] especially with the officers and the senior enlisted
[01:37:39] as a drill instructor, you know what I mean?
[01:37:42] I mean, you're bringing,
[01:37:45] you're bringing a lot of experience, you know what I mean?
[01:37:48] And work ethic back to the battalion.
[01:37:51] You know, my oldest daughter, she's married to a Marine.
[01:37:54] He's infantry.
[01:37:56] He just finished his, he was a DI.
[01:37:59] You know, of course he calls me, what should I do next?
[01:38:01] Drone instructor, man.
[01:38:02] You know what I mean?
[01:38:03] And he knocked it out the park
[01:38:04] and now he's back at Camp Lejeune.
[01:38:06] And that's the first thing I told him,
[01:38:08] leave the, leave the smokey, you know, at Parris Island.
[01:38:11] You know what I mean?
[01:38:12] There's just no place for it.
[01:38:13] That's not a, that's not a leadership style.
[01:38:17] You know, nobody really responds well to that.
[01:38:21] Other than Marine Corps recruits in, you know,
[01:38:25] at Parris Island.
[01:38:26] Right.
[01:38:27] That's it.
[01:38:28] That's it.
[01:38:29] But then the funny thing is, is like, you know,
[01:38:31] after you've been on the drill field,
[01:38:33] you can't really remember all the recruits that you've had,
[01:38:36] just cause there's just a whole bunch of them.
[01:38:38] So it's kind of hard to like keep up.
[01:38:40] But some of them, you end up like finding out that,
[01:38:43] like that kid was in your platoon and you go over to him
[01:38:47] and it's like, hey, my heck of me didn't come over
[01:38:48] and say anything.
[01:38:49] You're on platoon.
[01:38:49] They're like, I wasn't going to come over and talk to you.
[01:38:52] Man, like are you shitting me?
[01:38:54] Like dude, I'm scared to death at you.
[01:38:55] And it's just like, just a regular guy.
[01:38:57] You know what I mean?
[01:38:58] That whole perception and, you know,
[01:39:00] everybody still remembers their Marine drill instructors.
[01:39:04] It's even me, my Sergeant Williams
[01:39:07] was my senior drill instructor.
[01:39:08] I'll never forget that guy.
[01:39:10] Yeah.
[01:39:10] And he was motor T.
[01:39:11] Oddly enough, my drill instructor,
[01:39:14] I still remember in officer candidate school
[01:39:16] and his last name, his gunnery Sergeant Seals,
[01:39:20] which is an interesting coincidence, right?
[01:39:22] Yeah.
[01:39:23] Awesome guy.
[01:39:24] Awesome guy.
[01:39:25] So you get back to one six and now you're,
[01:39:28] now you're a platoon Sergeant.
[01:39:29] Is that right?
[01:39:30] Yeah.
[01:39:31] Yeah.
[01:39:31] I'm back.
[01:39:32] I was still a Sergeant.
[01:39:33] So I was at E five.
[01:39:34] Technically you're supposed to be a E six to get a platoon,
[01:39:38] but you know, they were, they were short on those guys.
[01:39:40] So I got a platoon.
[01:39:42] And this is what like 1997 or something like that?
[01:39:45] 96.
[01:39:46] Yeah.
[01:39:47] I finished, yeah.
[01:39:48] I finished on the drill field in 95
[01:39:49] and came over and right back into one six and 96.
[01:39:56] And I was very excited to be back at canvashing.
[01:40:03] Not that I didn't have a, like a good time at,
[01:40:06] at Pereson.
[01:40:07] I had a little bit, you know, as a D I had a little run in
[01:40:09] with a, with one of the battalion commanders that was down there.
[01:40:12] And he thought it was a little overly aggressive.
[01:40:15] And, you know, it was, you know,
[01:40:18] he told me, you know, let me tell you what it's like to be a
[01:40:21] drill instructor.
[01:40:22] And I was like, when were you a drill instructor, sir?
[01:40:26] That went over like a fart in church.
[01:40:27] You know what I mean?
[01:40:28] He didn't like that aspect of it.
[01:40:30] And so me and him didn't necessarily see eye to eye.
[01:40:33] So when I left Peres Island, they were like, you know,
[01:40:36] please don't come back.
[01:40:38] But it was a lot of fun.
[01:40:40] And then when I got back to the fleet,
[01:40:43] there was a lot of other guys that, you know,
[01:40:45] the drill instructor community is, is very small.
[01:40:48] And it's pretty tight.
[01:40:50] And if, and if you get back in, one of the company gunnies,
[01:40:54] his name was Clifford Happy.
[01:40:55] He was a hat.
[01:40:57] So when I came in, you know, I just got more opportunities
[01:41:01] just because I had that experience of being a drill
[01:41:03] instructor.
[01:41:04] So they gave me a platoon, which I was super stoked with.
[01:41:08] And they gave me a platoon commander.
[01:41:11] His name Buck Rollins.
[01:41:13] Dad was Wayne Rollins, two star general,
[01:41:16] Navy Cross, Warner Vietnam.
[01:41:19] Great guy, I've just attended his funeral a few months back.
[01:41:21] He was buried in Arlington.
[01:41:23] Buck Rollins and I, you know, somebody there,
[01:41:26] Doug Zembeck was there at the time.
[01:41:29] I mean, that battalion for some odd reason, man,
[01:41:31] we had some like amazing second lieutenants
[01:41:35] like that were just like, you didn't really see
[01:41:39] that many great guys that were all in that battalion
[01:41:44] from Pascoley to, you know, there was just a bunch of them.
[01:41:49] Freighto was in there, was platoon commanders.
[01:41:52] That was my first experience of where, you know,
[01:41:55] when you become up as a platoon sergeant,
[01:41:57] you get to spend more time with platoon commanders.
[01:42:00] You know, before that, you don't really hang out
[01:42:01] with the officers like at all, you know what I mean?
[01:42:05] But then you become like, you know, you're a partner.
[01:42:08] You know what I mean?
[01:42:09] You're gonna work this platoon together.
[01:42:11] And I had, you know, I was very fortunate
[01:42:14] I had Buck Rollins, I had Doug Zembeck, and I had Doug Olson.
[01:42:18] These guys were your platoon commanders?
[01:42:21] Yeah, and I worked with them.
[01:42:24] They were the platoon commander, but it's my platoon.
[01:42:28] Yeah.
[01:42:29] Yeah, they just get to hang out.
[01:42:30] Yeah.
[01:42:31] They're, they say in the officers,
[01:42:34] about the officers and the SEAL teams is like,
[01:42:35] they rent, we own.
[01:42:37] Yeah.
[01:42:38] The officers rent, we own.
[01:42:40] It's like the chief, you know, the e-dogs,
[01:42:43] it's their platoon.
[01:42:44] The officers just, you know, he's gonna be here
[01:42:46] for a little while, but this is our platoon.
[01:42:48] Yeah, that's pretty much the exact same thing it is
[01:42:50] in an infrashoot battalion.
[01:42:51] It's the platoon sergeant.
[01:42:53] It's, you know, like I said, I mean, you know,
[01:42:55] Eli Tucker had a huge effect on me as a platoon sergeant
[01:42:58] and, you know, coming in from the kids
[01:43:00] that were in that platoon.
[01:43:02] And I've stayed in 1-6 for like three and a half years
[01:43:07] in the battalion, did a couple of pumps.
[01:43:09] I was gonna say, so you do a workup, training cycle,
[01:43:13] and then go on deployment.
[01:43:14] Were you riding ships on those deployments?
[01:43:17] Yeah, riding ships, doing the workup.
[01:43:20] We did a med float, which was, which was super cool.
[01:43:24] We kind of got deployed early.
[01:43:25] I ended up over in Albania, Toronto, Albania,
[01:43:28] if you remember in like the 97 timeframe,
[01:43:30] they were kind of blowing embassies up around the,
[01:43:33] so we got the call.
[01:43:34] I was with the 24th, yeah, 24th Mu.
[01:43:37] And we would just finished up doing workup.
[01:43:41] And we needed to, they wanted us to go into Toronto, Albania.
[01:43:45] So, you know, I got the call.
[01:43:47] At that time I had the sniper platoon.
[01:43:50] So I had the snipers, I took 12 guys.
[01:43:54] And, you know, we jumped on C-130s up in Cherry Point
[01:43:59] with an infantry rifle company.
[01:44:01] And they flew us over.
[01:44:03] We did a refuel.
[01:44:05] I think it's Singapore, landed in Italy,
[01:44:07] got on a 53, flew out on a USS Ipan.
[01:44:10] With the 22nd Mu, got briefed in,
[01:44:12] and we were in country in Toronto, Albania
[01:44:15] after they had evacuated the embassies out of there.
[01:44:19] And that was, we stayed over there for a couple of months.
[01:44:22] And so what were you doing?
[01:44:23] What was your mission?
[01:44:24] Just basically running, the embassy was evacuated.
[01:44:30] So we were-
[01:44:31] So it's empty?
[01:44:32] Yeah, it's empty.
[01:44:33] I mean-
[01:44:34] And so you guys are basically doing security on the embassy?
[01:44:35] Yep.
[01:44:36] You mean get trashed or whatever?
[01:44:37] Or no one comes in and steals shit?
[01:44:39] Yep.
[01:44:40] And I mean, it had a lot of other agencies
[01:44:44] that were over there running around.
[01:44:47] There was some Navy SEALs were over there.
[01:44:50] There was a lot of stuff going on.
[01:44:52] You know what I mean?
[01:44:52] The overarching was Bosnia.
[01:44:54] You know what I mean?
[01:44:55] That whole region at the time.
[01:44:57] It was a really good experience.
[01:44:59] You know, especially for the younger guys
[01:45:01] that were in the platoon,
[01:45:02] the guys that I had in that platoon,
[01:45:05] even still this day, I'm still in contact with.
[01:45:09] You know, from those guys,
[01:45:11] that was a very special time.
[01:45:14] Those three years at 1.6,
[01:45:16] being a platoon sergeant or what you would call
[01:45:19] like chief scout kind of role was just huge.
[01:45:23] I learned more about myself then, you know,
[01:45:27] with those folks and just, you know,
[01:45:29] they're relying on me, you know what I mean?
[01:45:32] To train, educate them, take care of them.
[01:45:36] It was a really special time in a Marine Corps
[01:45:40] for that time in service.
[01:45:42] When you went over there, were you the senior guy
[01:45:45] or did you have an officer?
[01:45:47] We had an officer, company commander.
[01:45:49] Company commander, we had a,
[01:45:50] and then of course the Mew had some of their Mew staff
[01:45:54] that was over there.
[01:45:56] Sean Pascoley was a captain that was over there.
[01:45:58] I'm still friends with Sean.
[01:46:03] Those guys, they had a company kind of reinforced.
[01:46:06] So we had some guys that were at the embassy,
[01:46:08] we had some guys that kind of stayed back
[01:46:10] and they were at the housing complex.
[01:46:12] You still had State Department folks
[01:46:13] that were milling about the area
[01:46:16] and you know, they're just looking for bad guys.
[01:46:19] We did a lot of time like watching.
[01:46:21] We were basically the snipers, we were overwatch.
[01:46:24] So you know, we had Albanians working gates,
[01:46:26] stuff like that, you know, we would hire them
[01:46:29] and then we would do the overwatch for them.
[01:46:31] Over at the embassy, it was right next
[01:46:33] to the University of Toronto.
[01:46:35] So it was just a lot of observing,
[01:46:37] a lot of time observing,
[01:46:39] but it was the same experience for those guys
[01:46:42] that I got when I was in went to Panama.
[01:46:44] You know, when they issue out the live ammo,
[01:46:46] it's just a different game.
[01:46:48] You know, even though nothing eventful,
[01:46:51] which I'm thankful for, took place while we were over there.
[01:46:55] Because you know, the only thing that would come in
[01:46:57] in the back of my mind, when I think of like being
[01:46:58] at an embassy is Beirut.
[01:47:01] You know, when you're just blowing stuff up,
[01:47:04] that's not necessarily warfare anymore.
[01:47:06] You know, that's terrorist activities.
[01:47:09] That's a, you know, and you know,
[01:47:11] when you think of the events of an infantry company,
[01:47:15] you know, in a barracks, you know,
[01:47:17] you can't help but think of Beirut.
[01:47:20] So, but luckily we learned from that.
[01:47:22] The company commander was there,
[01:47:23] like we were very well dispersed.
[01:47:25] Nobody was gonna be in one, you know, single point of failure.
[01:47:29] The overwatch on the gates, the guards.
[01:47:31] I mean, it was, there wasn't, you know,
[01:47:33] the rules of engagement, you know,
[01:47:34] of what they had to deal with at Beirut,
[01:47:37] completely different.
[01:47:38] So obviously, you know, we were a learning organization
[01:47:41] of we're not gonna let this kind of happen again,
[01:47:43] which was really cool for those guys
[01:47:46] to kind of go through that experience.
[01:47:48] And then, you know, once everything was over,
[01:47:50] and the threats were pretty much eliminated and gone,
[01:47:54] they brought the embassy back and ambassador comes back in.
[01:47:56] And I mean, people go to Toronto, Albania on vacation.
[01:48:00] I mean, which is kind of funny.
[01:48:03] You know, even like, you know, people go to Panama now.
[01:48:06] It's a great vacation spot.
[01:48:09] You know, when I was there, I never thought that like,
[01:48:10] who would want to come to Toronto, Albania?
[01:48:13] You know what I mean?
[01:48:14] But they were super nice people, you know,
[01:48:17] beautiful part of the world,
[01:48:18] but just different than us.
[01:48:20] Then what came after that?
[01:48:23] After that, I got, when I attended, up at Quantico,
[01:48:27] I attended the advanced,
[01:48:28] they used to have an advanced sniper school up at Quantico.
[01:48:31] So I went through the advanced sniper school
[01:48:33] prior to that deployment.
[01:48:35] And the staff in CIC that was up there,
[01:48:38] Bill Norton, his name, we call him Max.
[01:48:41] Max is, he asked me if I wanted to come back up
[01:48:44] to be an instructor at Quantico
[01:48:46] after that next deployment.
[01:48:48] And of course, yeah, I was like, yeah.
[01:48:51] You know, I mean, going up to Quantico,
[01:48:54] so he brought me up there as an instructor
[01:48:56] when I got done.
[01:48:57] So I was an instructor at Quantico.
[01:48:59] I took over as the chief instructor
[01:49:01] for the school house up at Quantico, which was, I mean,
[01:49:04] it was tons of fun.
[01:49:07] Just, I mean, you know, everybody that shows up,
[01:49:10] I mean, sniper school,
[01:49:11] because they do the, we do the basic course,
[01:49:14] you do the advanced course,
[01:49:15] and then you do what's called the sniper employment
[01:49:18] officer course.
[01:49:19] So the guys that are gonna be like in charge
[01:49:21] of sniper platoons, we put them through a,
[01:49:23] like a sniper employment package,
[01:49:25] two week course kind of the thing at Quantico.
[01:49:28] And I mean, it was just, it was a lot of fun.
[01:49:31] Just every day, I mean, the instructors, the students,
[01:49:35] it's just a lot of fun.
[01:49:37] It's a great package.
[01:49:38] You know what I mean?
[01:49:39] The stocking exercises is like fun.
[01:49:42] You know what I mean?
[01:49:42] People should pay money to go do that.
[01:49:46] And then just the, you know, bury your ass in brass.
[01:49:48] I mean, you're gonna shoot a lot of ammo.
[01:49:52] So, and as an instructor at that level,
[01:49:57] you know, I was the chief instructor.
[01:49:58] I expected that all the instructors on the cadre
[01:50:00] should be able to perform any of the skill sets
[01:50:02] at any given time, 365 days, you know,
[01:50:06] when the kids would come in to run the physical fitness test,
[01:50:09] I expected the instructors out there running
[01:50:11] right along with the students.
[01:50:13] You know, that kind of an aspect of, you know,
[01:50:15] even though we've got mine, you know, a lot of times people,
[01:50:18] you know, I got mine, let's make it harder for the next guy.
[01:50:21] You know what I mean?
[01:50:22] The training schedule alone is hard enough.
[01:50:24] You don't have to.
[01:50:25] How long is the, how long is the sniper course?
[01:50:28] It's like 12 weeks.
[01:50:29] Oh, it's a freaking no joke.
[01:50:30] Yeah, I mean, it's, you know.
[01:50:32] Is that the sniper course for the whole Marine Corps?
[01:50:34] That's it.
[01:50:35] Yeah, well, we've got Quantico,
[01:50:36] and then you got Camp Lejeune, you got Pendleton.
[01:50:38] So right up here at Pendleton,
[01:50:39] they run the basic course four times a year.
[01:50:41] And how long is the basic course?
[01:50:43] It's the 12 week.
[01:50:44] Okay.
[01:50:44] And then they got rid of the advanced course.
[01:50:47] Matter of fact, they got rid of the basic course.
[01:50:49] Like it's all, and I'm sure it's better,
[01:50:51] like better now than whatever we were doing.
[01:50:54] You know, because we were still back in the,
[01:50:57] probably in the half-cock days, you know what I mean,
[01:51:00] of the white feather, you know, the Chuck Mulhaney,
[01:51:04] you know, we're gonna, you know, the stocking and,
[01:51:08] which stocking is a, I would say stocking is, it's patrolling.
[01:51:13] It's just on the ground.
[01:51:14] It's a different perspective.
[01:51:16] You know, stocking, you learn so much
[01:51:20] from just laying with your face,
[01:51:22] sucking the earth of what we call skull dragon.
[01:51:25] You might be the first person that I've heard say
[01:51:27] stocking was fun.
[01:51:28] Like most guys that go through the SEAL sniper course,
[01:51:31] they're like, stocking is not fun.
[01:51:33] I would say, because it's kind of, it's a game.
[01:51:38] You know, you're going up against a guy
[01:51:40] that's a trained observer and they're on glass.
[01:51:43] And the ability for you to be able to come in to,
[01:51:46] you know, 200 yards, you know what I mean,
[01:51:48] get two rounds off undetected and stock out.
[01:51:52] Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:51:53] I mean, it's just, it's amazing of the ability
[01:51:55] to hide, blend and deceive is pretty cool.
[01:52:00] And if you understand how that all works,
[01:52:03] I mean, you don't even need a ghillie suit.
[01:52:05] You could be literally naked and stock.
[01:52:08] If you understand how, you know,
[01:52:11] this is the stocking of blending backdrop, you know,
[01:52:14] the cover.
[01:52:16] So it was, it was a lot of fun.
[01:52:17] Plus you just get a lot of really good Marines.
[01:52:21] We used to get advanced course.
[01:52:22] We'd have Navy SEALs come through.
[01:52:23] We'd have Army Rangers come through up there.
[01:52:26] British Royal Commando.
[01:52:27] We actually have a British Royal on the staff at Quantico.
[01:52:30] We have a really good relationship with the Brits.
[01:52:34] So it's just a, you know, it's a fun time
[01:52:36] when you've got like 24 great Americans
[01:52:38] that just want to shoot bolt guns, you know what I mean?
[01:52:42] And look through glass.
[01:52:43] It's just a fun time.
[01:52:46] Everybody's there with a purpose.
[01:52:48] Like there's not, you know,
[01:52:49] the leadership aspect is kind of gone.
[01:52:51] You don't necessarily, you lead by example, you know what I mean?
[01:52:55] Like when I'm looking at an instructor, you know,
[01:52:57] if I walk in on training day one and the instructor looks
[01:53:01] like a seabag with lips and the first thing he's going to tell
[01:53:03] me how he used to be a badass, you know what I mean?
[01:53:06] Dude, you're 33 years old.
[01:53:08] You know what I mean?
[01:53:09] Like nobody's old here.
[01:53:11] You know what I mean?
[01:53:12] You know, but in that military, you think of,
[01:53:14] man, that guy's an old man.
[01:53:16] You know what I mean?
[01:53:17] He's 34, brother.
[01:53:18] You know what I mean?
[01:53:19] Like you should be in the prime in your 30s.
[01:53:23] So, you know, I always liked that about the snipers
[01:53:27] and even the, the process school, it's up the road up here.
[01:53:30] I'm sure it's the same with buds.
[01:53:31] I mean, the instructors that are there, you know,
[01:53:33] you just looking at them and I mean, they just,
[01:53:35] they look the part.
[01:53:36] They're better.
[01:53:37] Yeah.
[01:53:38] I mean, and they can do anything that they're asking
[01:53:41] the student to do, which is, is a super cool way
[01:53:45] of that, that leadership and then holding yourself accountable
[01:53:47] to be, to being able to, to perform at any given time.
[01:53:52] Yeah.
[01:53:54] So where are you when September 11th happens?
[01:53:57] Is this where you're at?
[01:53:58] Is this where your station when September 11th happens?
[01:54:00] Yep.
[01:54:01] I'm up at Quantico.
[01:54:02] That's why I call it, the world changed in nine miles.
[01:54:07] We got the students off and I went,
[01:54:08] there's a loop up at Quantico over where sniper school is.
[01:54:12] You can run over by TVS.
[01:54:13] When you say you got the students off,
[01:54:14] what do you mean?
[01:54:15] You caught them loose?
[01:54:16] No, no, no, like they're just, you know,
[01:54:17] they get them in in the morning.
[01:54:18] They're going to go to the range.
[01:54:19] They're going to do an observation exercise.
[01:54:21] They're going to do, you know what I mean?
[01:54:22] And there's another instructor that has them.
[01:54:23] Cause you know, when, on the instructor cadre,
[01:54:25] you kind of have to manage your time of, you know,
[01:54:28] obviously I got to be there when the students are there
[01:54:30] as the chief instructor.
[01:54:31] And then we got to get the day going.
[01:54:32] If I'm on the platform first or if I'm, so,
[01:54:34] and I always enjoy getting a run in, you know,
[01:54:37] throughout the day, get a chance to work out,
[01:54:39] go to the pool, do something.
[01:54:41] So that day on September 11th, we got, you know,
[01:54:44] we got students on deck.
[01:54:45] We get them off and going and,
[01:54:47] and I take off over towards the FBI Academy.
[01:54:49] So I'm right over there by the FBI Academy
[01:54:51] and the basic school.
[01:54:53] And there's a nine mile loop that goes around.
[01:54:56] And I take off, I let the guys know,
[01:54:58] Hey man, I'm going to go for a run.
[01:54:59] I'm going to run the loop.
[01:55:00] And they know exactly where I'm going.
[01:55:03] And so I'm, I'm off and running.
[01:55:05] And as I'm making my way in and around over by what they,
[01:55:08] they have a called Lake Lunga that's over at Quantico
[01:55:12] next to the FBI Academy.
[01:55:14] And I'm coming in and I'm seeing like a lot of aircraft
[01:55:17] like flying around.
[01:55:18] You know, the FBI always has like stuff going on.
[01:55:21] We got the hostage rescue team that's there as well.
[01:55:24] But then it's just like aircraft like Helos.
[01:55:27] Yeah. Helos and stuff.
[01:55:28] Like it's a lot of activity, which is that,
[01:55:30] but then all the black vehicles are just leaving
[01:55:34] the FBI compound.
[01:55:36] And yeah, cause you got it.
[01:55:38] That's the funny thing about like at Quantico
[01:55:41] that day before we used to not have gates.
[01:55:45] You could literally drive up I 95 and pull off the exit
[01:55:49] and drive straight on to range four
[01:55:51] with the sniper students laying right there on the range.
[01:55:53] And you didn't go through a gate.
[01:55:56] You didn't, nobody checked your ID card.
[01:55:58] Nothing. There was just no gates.
[01:56:01] And so I'm, I'm, I'm running back
[01:56:03] and I'm seeing all these vehicles fly out.
[01:56:05] And by the time I get back to the school house,
[01:56:08] it's kind of like, you know, I'm like, what the,
[01:56:10] what the hell's going on?
[01:56:11] And that's when, you know, the Pentagon's being hit,
[01:56:15] you know, New York, 9 11's being hit.
[01:56:18] And it's just like, it's game on.
[01:56:23] And the world changed in nine, nine miles.
[01:56:26] I mean, within a nine mile run, man,
[01:56:27] the world completely changed.
[01:56:29] We had sandbags, barracks.
[01:56:31] I mean, they're, they're man and gates.
[01:56:33] They're making gates.
[01:56:34] I mean, it was, it was total anarchy in Quantico.
[01:56:37] And as, and as you can imagine, I mean,
[01:56:39] being so close to the Pentagon of them hitting the Pentagon,
[01:56:43] they got guys that are coming in, you know,
[01:56:44] they're wanting to know like how can Marines support?
[01:56:47] That kind of was odd to me that like,
[01:56:50] we didn't have authorization to go out to like help.
[01:56:54] You know what I mean?
[01:56:54] Like you got all these Marines.
[01:56:56] You got all these folks like, why aren't Marines?
[01:56:58] Like, you know what I mean?
[01:56:59] Bring the Marines in.
[01:57:01] But then you have to look at it as like the events over.
[01:57:05] Like, you know what I mean?
[01:57:06] They flew into the buildings.
[01:57:06] You know, we're all thinking like, what's kind of next?
[01:57:09] No, that was it.
[01:57:11] That was the big event.
[01:57:12] And, you know, after that, then everybody knew
[01:57:17] at that point in time, it's go time.
[01:57:21] We're, you know, and the Marines are, you know,
[01:57:23] Army, I'm sure with you guys, with the teams,
[01:57:26] like everybody's watching, thinking, yeah,
[01:57:28] when are we going to deploy?
[01:57:31] When's the first action is going to start coming in?
[01:57:35] But yeah, I was at Quantico.
[01:57:38] So then what happens after that?
[01:57:42] Well, I had met a couple of guys
[01:57:47] through being up there at a sniper school.
[01:57:50] And there was a certain unit,
[01:57:53] and I was hoping to get selection into that.
[01:57:56] It's kind of, you know, one of the guys recommended me.
[01:57:58] So I went in, I went through recommendations.
[01:58:00] And with that, they needed a place for me
[01:58:04] to kind of hang out and await selection,
[01:58:07] like in the national capital region.
[01:58:09] So John Allen was the commandant and midshipman
[01:58:14] at the Naval Academy.
[01:58:15] And I had known him from down in the six Marines.
[01:58:19] And, you know, John Allen was like, yeah, hey,
[01:58:22] I'll take JD, bring him up to the Naval Academy.
[01:58:24] And of course I was like, yeah,
[01:58:25] I'm going to the Naval Academy.
[01:58:26] Like I had never been to Annapolis, Maryland
[01:58:29] a day in my life.
[01:58:30] I didn't, I mean, I knew the Academy,
[01:58:34] but like my perception of a Naval Academy graduate
[01:58:38] was Doug Zembeck.
[01:58:41] Like that's what I expected.
[01:58:43] And then my other guy that I worked with
[01:58:45] at a sniper school was John Bradley.
[01:58:48] John Bradley was a three time national boxing champ
[01:58:51] at the Academy.
[01:58:52] His call sign was big people.
[01:58:55] You know, half black, half German.
[01:58:58] I mean, the dude was like Rambo.
[01:59:00] You know what I mean?
[01:59:02] I'm still really good friends with John Brad.
[01:59:04] He's a great human being.
[01:59:07] But, you know, I used to make fun of them like, you know,
[01:59:09] cause he'd wear like Navy boxing and, you know,
[01:59:11] and of course Doug was a Navy wrestler.
[01:59:13] And I was like, dude, I want my taxpayer dollars back.
[01:59:16] There's no way you guys went to the Naval Academy.
[01:59:19] But that's my perception of the Naval Academy.
[01:59:22] You know, the officers that I had dealt with
[01:59:26] were, they'd come out of the Naval Academy.
[01:59:27] They were top notch.
[01:59:30] So that was, that was my perception going in.
[01:59:35] I can remember when I went up to check into the Naval Academy.
[01:59:38] I like, again, I didn't know where it was.
[01:59:40] I just knew it was in Annapolis.
[01:59:41] So I'm driving around Annapolis.
[01:59:42] I get over top of the Severn Bridge and I'm looking down.
[01:59:46] But I think that's like, it looks like the state capital.
[01:59:50] And there's like two women that are walking across the bridge.
[01:59:54] And I'm like, excuse me, ladies,
[01:59:55] do you guys like know where the Naval Academy is?
[01:59:57] And they're laughing like, dude, that's it.
[01:59:59] I was like, wow, like that's next level.
[02:00:04] Like, I mean, it's impressive.
[02:00:07] So I went down and checked into the Academy
[02:00:11] and, you know, John Allen,
[02:00:13] and at first I really didn't have a job for me to do
[02:00:15] because like the midshipmen had already started.
[02:00:19] And I really didn't know like what I was getting into.
[02:00:22] Like I didn't know like what they do at the Naval Academy.
[02:00:26] And your anticipation is that you're waiting to go to selection
[02:00:29] for a special mission unit
[02:00:30] and you're gonna be there for six months or something
[02:00:32] and then you'll roll out.
[02:00:33] Yep, that's my mindset.
[02:00:35] And, you know, and John Allen, you know, great guy, wicked smart.
[02:00:40] I was super excited because the library
[02:00:43] at the Naval Academy is off the chain.
[02:00:45] I mean, like it's off the chain.
[02:00:47] And I mean, I love a library.
[02:00:49] You know what I mean?
[02:00:51] And I get the, so I mean, there's a lot of history up there.
[02:00:54] I mean, Tecumseh court, you know what I mean?
[02:00:57] Like they got Tecumseh, you know what I mean?
[02:00:59] And so it was a bit of a root of awakening.
[02:01:03] Like, so the first morning kind of like, you know,
[02:01:05] this morning I got up, you know what I mean?
[02:01:07] I'm gonna go for a run.
[02:01:08] So that's how I like to like get myself like situational awareness
[02:01:11] of like get orientated is run.
[02:01:13] So I'll run around.
[02:01:15] So I'm running around Annapolis looking at the town and stuff.
[02:01:18] And I make my way back in and I'm on Tecumseh court.
[02:01:21] And as I'm in Tecumseh court, I'm standing there,
[02:01:23] I'm looking, I mean, they got like monuments
[02:01:25] like all over the place.
[02:01:26] I mean, the chapels there, it's pretty banging.
[02:01:29] They got like a bunch of different poles
[02:01:31] and they got Tecumseh.
[02:01:33] And I'm looking at the Cumsun next thing you know,
[02:01:35] like there's this Navy officer.
[02:01:38] He's like, hey, excuse me, hey, what are you doing?
[02:01:40] And I wasn't wearing anything.
[02:01:41] I said, Marines on it.
[02:01:43] And he's like, hey, you're not allowed to be out here
[02:01:45] in PT gear.
[02:01:47] I was like, am I not on a military installation?
[02:01:50] Like with the Navy, we don't like to PT
[02:01:53] and you don't want us to say, like it was,
[02:01:55] like it was odd, like the rules that they had there
[02:01:59] at the academy.
[02:02:01] And, you know, John Allen sent me over with the football team.
[02:02:04] Where couldn't you be with PT uniform on?
[02:02:06] I don't know.
[02:02:07] They didn't like PT gear being out there
[02:02:10] in Tecumseh court, like where they do like.
[02:02:12] So specifically Tecumseh court?
[02:02:13] Yeah, it's like, I guess it's a ceremonial area.
[02:02:17] Like you're supposed to be like in the Marine Corps,
[02:02:19] like everywhere's a PT area.
[02:02:20] You know what I mean?
[02:02:21] Like you can PT wherever you want.
[02:02:23] You know what I mean? Like I'd never been told,
[02:02:26] don't be out in front of people in this area in PT gear.
[02:02:31] So that was kind of odd.
[02:02:32] And then, you know, so I went over with the football team
[02:02:35] because at first I was like, oh, you know, college football.
[02:02:38] And I asked the coaches like, hey,
[02:02:41] is this like open practice?
[02:02:42] Is it cool if I watch?
[02:02:44] You know, they never like, yeah, dude.
[02:02:46] You know what I mean?
[02:02:46] You can come over and watch.
[02:02:47] And it was Coach Paul Johnson at the time
[02:02:50] and the strength coach and stuff.
[02:02:51] And I went over there and you know, the kids
[02:02:54] on the football team, I would say,
[02:02:59] yeah, I felt out of place at the Naval Academy.
[02:03:03] Like I didn't belong, like there's no Marines in the brochure.
[02:03:07] And there's definitely no Marine gunnies in the brochure.
[02:03:11] There were other gunnies that were there.
[02:03:13] But like you said, I mean, I was there.
[02:03:15] I just come from sniper school.
[02:03:16] I had a different outlook than a lot of the other folks.
[02:03:23] And so when I was over there,
[02:03:24] like the midshipment on the football team,
[02:03:26] like they immediately came over
[02:03:27] and started talking to me, asking me, you know, like,
[02:03:30] hey, who are you?
[02:03:31] What are you doing?
[02:03:32] Cause I wasn't in uniform.
[02:03:33] And I was like, yeah, hey, I'm gunny.
[02:03:35] And that's how I introduced myself to like Coach Paul Johnson
[02:03:37] and I think like, cause the coaches aren't military.
[02:03:41] So I think they thought like my first name was Gunny.
[02:03:44] And still to this day, they call me Gunny, you know,
[02:03:47] which I don't care.
[02:03:49] You know what I mean?
[02:03:50] And the football players and I, man,
[02:03:52] I got to stand out there and watch some of these kids
[02:03:54] that are going to compete on division one level.
[02:03:57] And they joined the academy with not really a lot of hopes
[02:04:01] of going to the NFL.
[02:04:04] But the kids on the team and the athletes that are there
[02:04:08] at the academy, the midshipmen are, I mean,
[02:04:10] they're just, they are really good people.
[02:04:14] You know, I look at them just like they joined them.
[02:04:17] They just read a different brochure than I did.
[02:04:19] And obviously scored like way higher on the SAT
[02:04:22] cause I never took that test.
[02:04:24] You know what I mean?
[02:04:25] But they were like really, really good kids at the academy.
[02:04:31] And I just had a phenomenal experience
[02:04:36] being there with the midshipmen.
[02:04:38] They welcomed me with open arms.
[02:04:40] The midship, I had more fun.
[02:04:41] So what job did you actually get assigned?
[02:04:43] I ended up being a senior enlisted advisor
[02:04:45] for 30th company.
[02:04:48] And so there's, how many companies are there?
[02:04:49] There's 30.
[02:04:50] Okay.
[02:04:51] And obviously 30th company had like a bad rap
[02:04:54] before I got there, you know what I mean?
[02:04:56] So they had them living on zero deck right next to the battle,
[02:05:00] the battalion officer.
[02:05:02] Well, the battalion officer was a guy named Allen Eshbock.
[02:05:05] And Allen Eshbock, great guy,
[02:05:07] went to Millersville State up in Pennsylvania,
[02:05:10] ran cross country and he was a Navy captain.
[02:05:13] And I had never really been around a Navy captain.
[02:05:17] You know what I mean?
[02:05:18] Not a lot of them, you know,
[02:05:19] I didn't interact with the ship's captain when I was,
[02:05:23] he didn't come down to sell block and hang out and slap spades.
[02:05:27] You know, so Allen Eshbock, he'd see me up running.
[02:05:31] You know what I mean?
[02:05:32] And he ran cross country.
[02:05:33] He was a surface warfare officer.
[02:05:35] He had the Arleigh Burke, you know,
[02:05:37] he ended up taking over the San Jacinto.
[02:05:40] And you know, I already kind of mentioned my kind of like
[02:05:43] being a ship's captain has got to be like a cool job.
[02:05:47] Well, so Allen started coming running with me in the morning.
[02:05:51] And he lived right there on the yard.
[02:05:53] And like these battalion officers,
[02:05:55] the houses that they get on the Naval Academy
[02:05:58] are pretty banging.
[02:05:59] And he would have me over for dinner and stuff.
[02:06:01] I got to know his wife, his kids.
[02:06:03] I mean, he was just a super nice guy.
[02:06:05] And so I ended up having this relationship
[02:06:07] with this Navy, this Navy captain.
[02:06:10] And he was just a great guy.
[02:06:11] We'd be really good friends.
[02:06:12] And we're still friends to this day.
[02:06:15] And he was about ready to roll out
[02:06:17] to go take over the USS San Jac.
[02:06:20] And as he was leaving,
[02:06:21] we were getting a new battalion officer coming in.
[02:06:24] And he's like, hey, he's like, JD is there?
[02:06:26] Which was kind of cool.
[02:06:27] The captain would call me JD.
[02:06:29] And he was like, hey, he's like,
[02:06:31] is there anything I can do for you like before I leave?
[02:06:34] And I was like, yeah,
[02:06:35] can you move 30th company up to eight four?
[02:06:39] So it's the highest point at the Navy.
[02:06:41] Nobody goes to eight four.
[02:06:44] Plus the midshipmen that have to walk the class every day,
[02:06:47] they're gonna have to walk all the way to eight four
[02:06:49] like every single day.
[02:06:51] And you have the midshipmen have to chop.
[02:06:53] They call that chopping where they like run
[02:06:55] and say, go Navy, beat Army.
[02:06:57] And did you see him when you were up there speaking?
[02:06:59] Like they do this chopping.
[02:07:00] Is that punishment?
[02:07:01] Or is that just standard operating procedure?
[02:07:02] Just standard operating procedure.
[02:07:04] Like I didn't know what they were doing.
[02:07:05] Like wait, just when you're going from class to class,
[02:07:07] every time you square a corner or something,
[02:07:09] you gotta say like go Navy, beat Army.
[02:07:11] Something like that.
[02:07:12] Yeah. And they call it chopping.
[02:07:13] So it's like they're running and they're in dress shoes,
[02:07:16] which makes absolutely no sense.
[02:07:18] But
[02:07:19] The sense is kind of thrown out the way.
[02:07:20] Yeah, the sense is thrown out the way.
[02:07:21] And so I'm watching these kids like,
[02:07:23] and they're calling it chopping.
[02:07:24] And I'm like, interesting.
[02:07:26] You know what I mean?
[02:07:27] Go Navy, beat Army.
[02:07:28] Okay, I got it.
[02:07:29] So that's a lot of chopping to get up to the top of eight four.
[02:07:32] You know what I mean?
[02:07:33] And then I knew nobody would come visit me.
[02:07:36] People are just lazy.
[02:07:37] You know what I mean?
[02:07:38] Like nobody's going to come up to eight four.
[02:07:39] I'm going to live up on eight four.
[02:07:41] It's going to be great.
[02:07:42] So eight four is a building?
[02:07:44] Yeah, eight four.
[02:07:45] It's like Bancroft Hall.
[02:07:46] Like when you saw Bancroft,
[02:07:47] I was all the way in the very back.
[02:07:50] So I was the farthest away from Tecumsecourt as possible.
[02:07:54] And I was the closest to the football locker as possible.
[02:07:58] And you know, I mean, the athletes
[02:08:02] and the, and being assigned up there,
[02:08:05] it was a great place to be as a, as a senior enlisted.
[02:08:12] Because like, I'm not teaching these kids.
[02:08:14] Like if you're an officer and you got to get,
[02:08:16] like I was there with Randall, Lieutenant Randall was there.
[02:08:19] You know what I mean?
[02:08:20] He was a company officer and like company officers
[02:08:21] have to like teach stuff.
[02:08:23] Like they got to go over to academia and teach doubly
[02:08:27] or they got to like do stuff.
[02:08:29] I'm not teaching doubly.
[02:08:31] You know what I mean?
[02:08:31] And you know, they're not gonna,
[02:08:33] I was, I had to do is like just hang out.
[02:08:35] You know what I mean?
[02:08:36] Like a full-time mentor.
[02:08:37] Yeah. And hang out and just be there for the kids
[02:08:40] if they need anything.
[02:08:41] And, and, and I work with a Navy Lieutenant, great guy.
[02:08:45] It was a lot of fun.
[02:08:46] But I mean, so when the kids go to class, it's like,
[02:08:48] you got nothing to do, but you've got an Olympic pool.
[02:08:51] You've got batting cages.
[02:08:52] You got football cages.
[02:08:53] You got an indoor track.
[02:08:54] You got a sailing center.
[02:08:56] You got soccer fields.
[02:08:57] You got a rifle team.
[02:08:59] You got like, dude, I didn't,
[02:09:01] it was a camp.
[02:09:03] I mean, I literally, it was, I was back at camp
[02:09:05] except like they have like the best facilities,
[02:09:09] like known to man, I'd go out and throw BP for the baseball.
[02:09:12] I'd go out and do, you know, batting practice.
[02:09:14] I just get to know the kids, you know,
[02:09:17] that were going through.
[02:09:18] And if they had questions about, you know,
[02:09:19] joining the Marine Corps and stuff like that.
[02:09:21] And then especially with the football team.
[02:09:23] The one thing that I learned there is like, you know,
[02:09:25] the football players don't have to do like the,
[02:09:28] the Friday parades and they get out of a lot of other stuff.
[02:09:31] They do their own meals and stuff.
[02:09:33] And I think that, you know, there's a lot of folks
[02:09:35] that don't understand what it takes to compete
[02:09:38] at division one level football.
[02:09:42] You know what I mean?
[02:09:43] Like, do other athletes get out of that stuff too?
[02:09:46] No, not like football gets out.
[02:09:49] And I wouldn't really say-
[02:09:50] What about the wrestlers?
[02:09:51] No.
[02:09:53] Soccer players?
[02:09:54] No.
[02:09:55] So it's just football.
[02:09:56] Yeah.
[02:09:57] They, I mean, the other, like the other sports teams,
[02:09:59] if they've got a game, they'll get out of something.
[02:10:02] But like football is, is looked at, I mean,
[02:10:07] is looked at differently at the academy.
[02:10:10] And then you're hiring a coach like coach Paul Johnson.
[02:10:14] He came from Georgia Tech.
[02:10:15] Great guy.
[02:10:16] He's the highest paid guy in the Navy.
[02:10:19] Like this dude makes more than the C and O.
[02:10:22] This is like the head coach at Army makes more
[02:10:24] than the chief of staff of the Army,
[02:10:26] which kind of puts stuff into perspective.
[02:10:28] You know what I mean?
[02:10:29] Like, well, wait a minute, man.
[02:10:30] Like I can make more money being the head coach
[02:10:32] at Navy than the C and O.
[02:10:34] You know what I mean?
[02:10:35] Like, like this dude's driving a nuclear submarine.
[02:10:38] You know what I mean?
[02:10:39] But the football coach, and it's just like, you know,
[02:10:41] Ken Neumott that's there right now.
[02:10:43] Great guy.
[02:10:44] He was an O line coach when I was there.
[02:10:46] And the coaches just doing a job.
[02:10:47] They get hired to do a job, compete at the division one level,
[02:10:50] pack the stands and the football team,
[02:10:52] because of the amount of money that they make, you know,
[02:10:55] at stadiums, ticket sales, stuff like that,
[02:10:57] pays for a lot of the other sports programs
[02:11:00] to be able to take place.
[02:11:01] Yeah, it's gotta be recruiting too.
[02:11:03] They probably take recruiting budgets,
[02:11:04] probably paying that coach's salary.
[02:11:06] Yeah, so, and the coaches are great.
[02:11:09] And the kids that they get on that football team,
[02:11:12] I mean, you know, people are like, oh, they get out
[02:11:14] of the Friday afternoon herd across the grass.
[02:11:16] You know what I mean?
[02:11:17] Like really?
[02:11:18] They're up at five o'clock in the morning.
[02:11:20] They gotta watch films.
[02:11:21] They got tapes.
[02:11:22] They got practice.
[02:11:23] They got weights.
[02:11:24] They got, I mean, they have to perform.
[02:11:26] You know what I mean?
[02:11:27] On Saturday, you know, their weekends, their thanksgivings,
[02:11:31] if they get a bowl game, you know, what they sacrifice
[02:11:33] to be able to play division one football
[02:11:35] and then go serve their country just like everybody else.
[02:11:38] So they're just there on a different aspect.
[02:11:41] I think some of the folks just don't,
[02:11:42] they don't look at it that way,
[02:11:43] but the student athletes at the academy are phenomenal.
[02:11:47] I mean, they're just one, the team players.
[02:11:49] You know what I mean?
[02:11:50] Like if you leave a team sport from the academy
[02:11:55] and join the Marine Corps,
[02:11:56] it's a very easy transition.
[02:11:58] You know, because you're just leaving one team
[02:12:00] and you're just joining another team.
[02:12:03] And the athletes transition really well into the Marine Corps.
[02:12:08] And you know, I just think that the kids
[02:12:11] that were on the team, I mean,
[02:12:12] they, I had like a lot of fun with those kids.
[02:12:16] And then, you know, some of them,
[02:12:17] when they select Marines at the end of the year,
[02:12:19] you got like, oh, line guys, you got defensive line guys
[02:12:22] that have never run farther than 100 yards in their life.
[02:12:25] And now it's the end of football season.
[02:12:27] And oh, hey, by the way,
[02:12:29] you got to meet height and weight standards by May.
[02:12:31] Yeah, that's hard for some of the guys that go to Buds.
[02:12:35] You know, they got to like totally change their physique.
[02:12:38] Like they got to become a different kind of human being.
[02:12:41] Like I got one friend that was at the Naval Academy
[02:12:45] played football and I don't want to say his nickname,
[02:12:48] but he's a big guy.
[02:12:50] And even when I know him, he's a big guy, like a big guy.
[02:12:53] But apparently I didn't know him when he played football,
[02:12:55] but he had to like change who he was as a human being
[02:13:00] to get from playing whatever freaking linemen
[02:13:04] at the Naval Academy to go and run, you know,
[02:13:07] 12 miles and four miles and six miles.
[02:13:10] And you know, like all that running.
[02:13:12] Just to tell you, you're a different human.
[02:13:14] Yeah.
[02:13:15] That's a challenge.
[02:13:16] Yeah, and then you got to teach them how to run.
[02:13:19] Like, you know, some of them just, they don't,
[02:13:22] I mean, there's a big difference
[02:13:23] between sprinting a hundred yards and running three miles.
[02:13:27] And then, oh, by the way, you're going to go to TBS.
[02:13:31] You know what I mean?
[02:13:31] Especially if you go to Marines,
[02:13:32] but even if they're, if they're going,
[02:13:34] you know, surface warfare or going to,
[02:13:35] I mean, that's a big transition for a lot of those guys
[02:13:40] that are out there and, you know,
[02:13:42] and I would run them in a mile and a half.
[02:13:43] The only thing that I could do,
[02:13:44] my biggest shock when I was at the Academy was like,
[02:13:49] I was talking to some of the, Mitch,
[02:13:50] and one of them was, it was Jason Copeland.
[02:13:52] He's a Marine Lieutenant Colonel now.
[02:13:54] He's the Amphitrubitian Commander.
[02:13:55] Great human being.
[02:13:58] So Jason, I was like, hey,
[02:13:59] what do we guys got going on tomorrow morning?
[02:14:01] Like, you guys got your physical fitness test.
[02:14:03] I heard, because I didn't know like what these kids did.
[02:14:06] And he's like, yeah, we'll meet out by the,
[02:14:08] by the Farragut and, you know,
[02:14:10] the PT department takes care of the physical fitness test.
[02:14:14] And they run the PRT and I was like, oh yeah, what is it?
[02:14:16] You know what I mean?
[02:14:17] Okay, well we do, you know, pushups, setups,
[02:14:19] and then we do a mile and a half run.
[02:14:20] I was like, okay, that's cool.
[02:14:21] What time do you go?
[02:14:22] I'd like to come out.
[02:14:24] Well, most of the staff there are like,
[02:14:26] why, it's early in the morning.
[02:14:28] Like, why are you gunning?
[02:14:29] Why are you, you don't have to go.
[02:14:31] I was like, well, I know I don't have to go,
[02:14:35] but I should go and run with the kids.
[02:14:40] So I showed up and they do each battalion.
[02:14:43] So there's six battalions and each battalion gets a day
[02:14:47] and they show up and there's, you know, five battalions
[02:14:50] and, or five companies and each battalion,
[02:14:52] they're gonna run five physical readiness tests.
[02:14:56] So I show up and, you know,
[02:14:58] they're only gonna run a mile and a half.
[02:15:00] So, you know, so for me, I was like, well,
[02:15:03] I asked the PE guy, like, do you care
[02:15:05] if I like run with them?
[02:15:07] Am I allowed to run with them?
[02:15:08] You know what I mean?
[02:15:09] Like I'll do a 10, 30 pace, just run along.
[02:15:12] And, you know what I mean?
[02:15:12] Kind of give the kids an earmark of like where I'm at.
[02:15:15] Cause I used to do that at cyber school.
[02:15:17] Like if I'd run the three mile and I'm like,
[02:15:19] hey, I'm gonna run right at a, of what is a 20, 30 pace.
[02:15:26] So for three miles, I'm gonna run it in 20 minutes
[02:15:28] and 30 seconds because that's worth 85 points.
[02:15:32] So if you see JD, he's worth 85 points.
[02:15:34] If you're in front of me, you know what I mean?
[02:15:36] Cause it's all the numbers game.
[02:15:37] If you're not good at pullups, you better bank it on the run.
[02:15:39] If you're not, you know what I mean?
[02:15:40] So it's your strength and weaknesses.
[02:15:42] So I was like, you know, and I was like, okay,
[02:15:44] this is the naval academy.
[02:15:45] Like it's only a mile and a half.
[02:15:47] You got to do it in 10, 30.
[02:15:48] That's seven minute pace, man.
[02:15:49] It's pretty easy.
[02:15:51] So as I'm out there and I'm watching the kids
[02:15:54] and I'm running along with them, you know,
[02:15:55] kind of going along and I'm like,
[02:15:56] hey, where, where, where are these guys going?
[02:15:58] Like they're falling out.
[02:15:59] Like where it's only a mile and a half and they're falling out.
[02:16:01] And I was just like, well, they, they failed.
[02:16:04] Like they didn't pass the run.
[02:16:05] So I go over to the PE department and I'm kind of like,
[02:16:08] so what happens to these kids, man?
[02:16:09] They like pack their shit.
[02:16:10] They done.
[02:16:11] And they're like, no, remediate.
[02:16:13] You know what I mean?
[02:16:14] They're going to remediate the hell out of them.
[02:16:16] And I always thought like, well, this is something
[02:16:18] that I could help out.
[02:16:21] You know, I can, I can come out and run with these kids.
[02:16:24] And so I used to go run when they do the PRTs
[02:16:28] for the, for the brigade of midshipmen.
[02:16:30] I would run 30 of them back to back at a 10, 30 pace.
[02:16:36] And I was like, yeah, only five a day though.
[02:16:39] Oh, okay.
[02:16:40] So, you know what I mean?
[02:16:41] It's really not that hard.
[02:16:42] It's only like eight, eight and a half miles.
[02:16:43] You know what I mean?
[02:16:44] And for me, I'm not a runner.
[02:16:46] I just have a running problem.
[02:16:48] You know what I mean?
[02:16:49] So for me, like that seven minute pace was, you know,
[02:16:52] it's a pretty good workout for me.
[02:16:53] I'd come out and I would run with the kids and kind of,
[02:16:56] you know what I mean?
[02:16:57] And, you know, kind of help them and push them.
[02:17:00] Like if they're going to fall back,
[02:17:01] this is something that I can actually, you know,
[02:17:04] help out with the naval academy.
[02:17:06] If there's a kid struggling with a mile and a half,
[02:17:08] I can help him out and get him to pass so that, you know,
[02:17:11] because once he goes to the fleet and he's in the Navy,
[02:17:13] that's not a required, 1030 is not a requirement in the fleet.
[02:17:17] It's just the naval academy requirement for officers.
[02:17:20] So, but hopefully, yeah.
[02:17:21] So I used to do that with the kids and I would get excited.
[02:17:26] You know what I mean?
[02:17:26] To go out and run the PRTs with the midshipmen.
[02:17:30] Cause I mean, it was hysterical.
[02:17:32] Just, you know, watching them for the mile and a half.
[02:17:36] How is the psychological molding of the guys
[02:17:41] or the people or the kids that are going to the naval academy
[02:17:45] compared to what you saw at bootcamp?
[02:17:49] Well, it's, yeah, there's, it's the country club.
[02:17:55] Yeah, I would say it's kind of like being a Catholic school
[02:17:57] and you're just a nun.
[02:17:59] You know what I mean?
[02:18:00] You're a nun.
[02:18:02] Yeah, it's, it's, it's not, yeah, it's night and day.
[02:18:04] You know, they do plebe summer that's there,
[02:18:08] but it's the, it's the upper class
[02:18:11] are kind of running plebe summer.
[02:18:12] And they do, I mean, they do a pretty good job,
[02:18:15] but they're not drill instructors.
[02:18:17] You know what I mean?
[02:18:18] They're not smoking it out.
[02:18:18] They're not, you know, the shock and all isn't as much,
[02:18:22] but they do a, they do a pretty good job with them
[02:18:25] at a plebe summer and, you know, and being a plebe
[02:18:28] at the naval academy to me was like,
[02:18:29] dude, that just does not look like fun.
[02:18:32] Yeah, it looks awful.
[02:18:32] Like at all.
[02:18:34] One, I gotta say, go Navy beat army
[02:18:36] and chop around the place in my dress shoes.
[02:18:39] You know, I know liberty.
[02:18:40] I don't get to really do anything.
[02:18:42] I, you know, the knowledge that they push
[02:18:45] on those kids there though,
[02:18:46] and the, and the education level is phenomenal.
[02:18:49] And then I would say like the, the comradery of the,
[02:18:53] of each class is just, it's outstanding
[02:18:57] with the naval academy of bringing those kids together,
[02:19:00] you know, sharing and, and the, and the suffering together
[02:19:04] all four years at the academy.
[02:19:07] But it is a, it's a great institution
[02:19:09] and they put out a, a great product in my opinion.
[02:19:14] Probably the, the best to watch was the ones
[02:19:18] that wanted to go special warfare, Navy seals.
[02:19:21] That was the most while I was there, you know,
[02:19:24] Randall was a lieutenant and he kind of ran that pre-buds
[02:19:28] kind of selection process there.
[02:19:30] It's a tight selection.
[02:19:32] Oh, it is the most comp, I mean,
[02:19:34] he's got like a couple of hundred kids that want to be,
[02:19:36] I mean, there's only a thousand of them
[02:19:38] and a couple hundred of them want to become a seal.
[02:19:40] Yeah. And there's like 15 billets,
[02:19:43] something like that, 15 slots.
[02:19:44] Yeah. And yeah, I've been, it's always been cool.
[02:19:48] I've done, during COVID, I did some,
[02:19:51] some virtual training with the, with the midshipmen.
[02:19:56] I've gone there alive.
[02:19:57] It's been awesome to go up there alive and, and just,
[02:19:59] you know, talk about leadership from my perspective.
[02:20:01] And they're definitely stoked on it.
[02:20:03] Very cool.
[02:20:04] But yeah, that competitiveness for the seal billets,
[02:20:06] in any, whether you're ROT, in the,
[02:20:08] any of the officer seal billets is,
[02:20:11] it's hard, it's very, very difficult.
[02:20:13] Probably, well, because the recruiting,
[02:20:15] because so many people want to go into, to that job.
[02:20:20] And it's a rough job to get into.
[02:20:22] Yeah, I would say, yeah.
[02:20:25] But what those kids would, you know,
[02:20:27] the thing that, that I learned while I was there,
[02:20:29] was kind of disappointing for me being a Marine,
[02:20:33] was the, the Marine selection.
[02:20:34] So you would have like, you know, I mean,
[02:20:36] let's say you got a hundred kids that put,
[02:20:38] they want to go Navy SEALs as another choice.
[02:20:41] And then Marine ground as their second.
[02:20:43] And you would have Marines that were up on the yard,
[02:20:46] going, that's bullshit.
[02:20:47] You know what I mean?
[02:20:48] If they're not Marine first, we don't want,
[02:20:49] I'm like, these kids are going after,
[02:20:51] like if, if JD was there, who wouldn't,
[02:20:55] it's the Naval Academy, man.
[02:20:56] Like, I mean, they want to go Navy SEAL.
[02:20:58] They're going to compete for the hardest billet going.
[02:21:02] Yeah.
[02:21:03] You know, at least physically.
[02:21:04] Yeah, that's actually another way to look at it,
[02:21:06] is, hey, these guys want the hardest possible job.
[02:21:08] And they're trying to get in the heart,
[02:21:10] the most selective thing.
[02:21:11] So they're taking the most selective thing.
[02:21:13] That's the SEAL billet.
[02:21:15] If they don't get that.
[02:21:16] Yeah, cause that is horrible.
[02:21:17] And I had, I've had a bunch of friends, you know,
[02:21:19] that graduated from the Naval Academy,
[02:21:20] that had to make that call.
[02:21:23] And it's so hard.
[02:21:24] I mean, LEAF didn't get selected out of the Naval Academy.
[02:21:28] SEAF didn't get selected out of the Navy.
[02:21:29] And they both went to, you know, a ship.
[02:21:32] And that's a different personality type
[02:21:35] that is going to be a ship, a swell.
[02:21:37] It's a different, it's a different type of mindset
[02:21:40] than someone that's going to be some kind of a land soldier.
[02:21:44] You know, whether it's a Marine or a special operations guy,
[02:21:46] it's a different type of mindset you have to have.
[02:21:49] And so both, I forget, I have to ask Leif again,
[02:21:53] but you know, he got told the same thing.
[02:21:54] He's like, Hey, there's, it's a waste to put Marine Corps
[02:21:58] after SEALs cause yours is not going to get taken.
[02:22:01] And Leif, you know, would have loved
[02:22:03] if he didn't make it into SEALs, but you know,
[02:22:07] he probably would have gotten picked up for the Marine Corps
[02:22:09] and probably would have never joined the SEAL teams.
[02:22:11] And the Marine Corps would have had a cool officer.
[02:22:13] Yeah, I mean, that's kind of like,
[02:22:15] I knew a lot of these kids, like they would come out and like,
[02:22:17] cause I would run every morning at five.
[02:22:20] You know what I mean?
[02:22:21] So I'd go run and, and I ran a lot like,
[02:22:23] they had a marathon team that was there at the academy.
[02:22:27] So I became like the O-Rap for them.
[02:22:29] So like the Naval Academy would like fly us around.
[02:22:31] So I mean, we're doing Chicago, we're doing Boston,
[02:22:34] we're doing Disney, you know what I mean?
[02:22:37] Like with the midshipmen and, and you know,
[02:22:39] and if they knew that like midshipmen can't leave the yard,
[02:22:42] but if they're running with me,
[02:22:44] then they're allowed to just say, I'm with Gunny,
[02:22:46] you know what I mean?
[02:22:47] And they right out the gate, we'd go run through town.
[02:22:49] So they're not just doing like outers around the academy
[02:22:52] and stuff.
[02:22:53] And you would see just the commitment that those kids had
[02:22:56] that are trying to compete for those billets to include
[02:22:58] the EOD billets as well that are coming out as a,
[02:23:01] you know, as a naval officer to get those billets
[02:23:03] are very hard to get.
[02:23:06] And for us to like miss out on some of those guys and gals
[02:23:10] that, okay, that's great that they put Navy SEAL
[02:23:12] or whatever for the first choice.
[02:23:14] They want Marine's second choice.
[02:23:16] Like they're going to be good.
[02:23:17] Like, you know what I mean?
[02:23:18] Like that did, and they let me sit in on one of these
[02:23:22] selection boards, which was very,
[02:23:23] I'd never been on an officer selection.
[02:23:25] SEAL selection board?
[02:23:26] No, no, no, Marines.
[02:23:27] Oh, okay.
[02:23:28] And everybody's got like these little hidden buttons.
[02:23:30] You know what I mean?
[02:23:31] Of whether or not like you want to vote,
[02:23:32] like yes or no, which I kind of thought was bullshit
[02:23:34] that we're kind of hiding the button.
[02:23:36] Like, dude, you could put my button right out in front
[02:23:38] of everybody.
[02:23:39] You know what I mean?
[02:23:40] Like, nope, don't like that one.
[02:23:41] Everybody can see, you know what I mean?
[02:23:42] That, oh, JD doesn't like him.
[02:23:44] Nope, don't like him.
[02:23:46] And, you know, we had this, this one kid and he's a nice,
[02:23:49] he was a nice kid.
[02:23:51] But there's a lot of nice kids that shouldn't be
[02:23:53] a Marine officer.
[02:23:55] And this guy, like, we're in there.
[02:23:59] And Colonel Inman was the senior Marine on the yard
[02:24:02] at the time.
[02:24:02] And Colonel Inman, great guy.
[02:24:04] Went to the University of Oklahoma, just a phenomenal guy.
[02:24:09] And he's the one that had me in there.
[02:24:10] He's like, yeah, hey, JD, you would like your input.
[02:24:12] You know a lot of these kids.
[02:24:14] You know what I mean?
[02:24:14] I was like, okay, yeah, cool.
[02:24:15] I've never been in here before.
[02:24:18] So I'm sitting there looking and they got a show a picture
[02:24:19] and somebody's going to brief their package kind of thing.
[02:24:22] And then you do the little hidden vote.
[02:24:24] And then, you know, they see on the board,
[02:24:26] okay, yeah, this guy got enough votes.
[02:24:27] He's going to go in the go-powl.
[02:24:29] So he's just going to go in the go-powl.
[02:24:31] They got this one kid that they put up on there.
[02:24:34] And I'm like, oh, this guy, nice kid, seabag with lips, man.
[02:24:38] Like, TBS is going to crush him.
[02:24:41] You know what I mean?
[02:24:41] Like, the heart's there.
[02:24:43] It's just, you know, he's just, he's not going to work out
[02:24:46] as a Marine officer.
[02:24:47] You know what I mean?
[02:24:48] He doesn't have the self-discipline.
[02:24:51] So of course I hit the no and he goes to the go-powl.
[02:24:56] So I'm a little shocked.
[02:24:58] So I was like, excuse me, sir, like, who voted for that guy?
[02:25:04] Like, does anybody here like know him?
[02:25:06] Like, no shit, like, you know the guy.
[02:25:09] Like I've seen him out there
[02:25:10] on the remedial physical fitness field.
[02:25:13] You know what I mean?
[02:25:14] Trying to pass a 10-30.
[02:25:16] Like I looked at it as if we're going to stamp a kid
[02:25:20] with the little n-star from the Naval Academy,
[02:25:22] we're going to send him down to TBS,
[02:25:24] then all of my peers that know
[02:25:26] that I'm at the Naval Academy are like,
[02:25:28] oh, this is JD's guys.
[02:25:31] You know what I mean?
[02:25:31] I don't want JD's name on this guy
[02:25:34] because he's not going to fare well
[02:25:36] when they do the physical fitness aspects.
[02:25:38] And he's like, well, I mean, it's a,
[02:25:40] you know, we don't disclose who's voting.
[02:25:41] I was just like, I mean, I'm being serious.
[02:25:43] Like, does anybody know this kid?
[02:25:44] Like, I know this kid.
[02:25:46] Like he's, we're setting him up for failure.
[02:25:49] And basically, Colonel Emmond says, well, JD, he's legacy.
[02:25:54] And I'm like, okay, well, that's a new one.
[02:25:57] What's legacy?
[02:25:59] Well, his dad was a Marine officer.
[02:26:02] So then I was like, okay, so we're getting flounder.
[02:26:06] Remember an animal house when, you know,
[02:26:08] they took flounder because he was legacy?
[02:26:11] I was like, so we're going to get flounder
[02:26:14] in the Marine Corps because of legacy.
[02:26:16] I thought that was kind of, I mean,
[02:26:18] my dad scouted Major League Baseball.
[02:26:19] Do I get in just because of the legacy?
[02:26:22] You know what I mean?
[02:26:22] Like that shouldn't, that was a little bit disappointing
[02:26:25] to see that I mean-
[02:26:26] Yeah, that should not play a role.
[02:26:27] It should play a role.
[02:26:28] If anything, they should be harder on him.
[02:26:30] You would think.
[02:26:32] Yeah, so, but other than that, you know,
[02:26:35] I got the coolest thing happened to me when I was there.
[02:26:37] I was coming out of football practice.
[02:26:39] It was a class of 2000, year of 2005.
[02:26:43] And a couple of the football players are like,
[02:26:45] hey, they were like, Gunny,
[02:26:46] hey man, you're going to graduate with us.
[02:26:49] I said, what do you mean I'm not going to graduate?
[02:26:51] In like physical fitness, you know what I mean?
[02:26:53] Like they're giving me a PE award and stuff.
[02:26:55] He's like, nope, we voted you to be our honorary graduate
[02:26:58] and graduate with the class of 2005.
[02:27:00] And it's voted by the midshipman, which was like,
[02:27:05] that's the coolest thing I've ever-
[02:27:08] What kind of people do they normally vote for that?
[02:27:10] Not Gunnies.
[02:27:11] You know what I mean?
[02:27:13] Like I did a little bit of like,
[02:27:14] it's normally like some professor or some other officer.
[02:27:18] You know what I mean?
[02:27:20] Kind of of a thing.
[02:27:22] So your class of 2005.
[02:27:23] Class of 2005.
[02:27:25] Love him.
[02:27:26] Yeah.
[02:27:27] I just went to a Marine Corps ball
[02:27:29] with Lieutenant Colonel Adam Horne.
[02:27:31] He's got a 53 squadron down at Cherry Point.
[02:27:33] And when he became the squadron CEO, he called me
[02:27:37] and he's like, hey, JD, I want you to be
[02:27:39] the guest speaker at our ball.
[02:27:41] I'm like, you know what I mean?
[02:27:42] He goes, I'm finally in charge
[02:27:43] and I get to pick the guy coming.
[02:27:45] And I was like, dude, I was never like in the air wing.
[02:27:48] Don't give two shits.
[02:27:49] You're coming.
[02:27:50] He goes, cause you know, and when I was down there
[02:27:52] with him, I mean, it came for, he's like,
[02:27:53] I joined the Marines because of this guy.
[02:27:56] You know, and it was great for one,
[02:27:58] for the enlisted Marines that were in his squadron
[02:28:01] to see an enlisted Marine having a relationship
[02:28:04] with their CEO that like, that we could be friends, man.
[02:28:07] Like we're on the same team.
[02:28:08] Like, you know, it's a great organization
[02:28:12] and great to be a part of.
[02:28:14] And then after that, I got accepted into the alumni
[02:28:18] with the Naval Academy.
[02:28:19] They allowed me in the alumni.
[02:28:21] So I'm an alumnus with the Quantico chapter.
[02:28:25] Yeah, which is-
[02:28:26] You like a ring knocker.
[02:28:28] Did you get a ring?
[02:28:29] No, I didn't.
[02:28:30] Well, I got three of them.
[02:28:31] I got three bowl rings with the football team.
[02:28:34] Yeah, I did that.
[02:28:36] I'm really not a ring guy.
[02:28:38] I had thought about it.
[02:28:39] You know, some of the folks at the academy were like,
[02:28:41] yeah, man, we gotta get gunny a ring.
[02:28:44] You know what I mean?
[02:28:46] But I tell you what, that experience
[02:28:49] at the Naval Academy, I mean, was phenomenal.
[02:28:53] I can't say enough.
[02:28:54] I mean, every organization has problems.
[02:28:58] But for what those midshipmen do and for what they give,
[02:29:02] you know, they're getting a four year education
[02:29:04] and the service that they give back
[02:29:06] and some of the shit they gotta put up with up there.
[02:29:09] Hands are good to say.
[02:29:10] They make them pay for that for the education out there.
[02:29:12] Yeah, they're paying for it.
[02:29:14] But they're like, I mean, they are quality Americans.
[02:29:18] And that's all the service academies, I would say.
[02:29:21] I mean, they're just a great group of individuals.
[02:29:24] And I mean, I had a complete ball at the academy.
[02:29:27] Yeah, no, it's it.
[02:29:29] I've gone to West Point and talked to them.
[02:29:31] I've gone to the Air Force Academy and talked to them.
[02:29:33] It's just, yeah, very cool, very cool thing to look at.
[02:29:37] What happened with the special mission unit
[02:29:39] you were gonna select for?
[02:29:41] Well, that in 2003, so they have what they call,
[02:29:47] it's a leather neck program where they take the midshipmen
[02:29:51] that want to select Marine Corps.
[02:29:54] Their junior year, they take them to Quantico.
[02:29:56] Because, give them a little taste.
[02:29:58] Yeah, because they're the only, like the Naval Academy
[02:30:01] doesn't have to go to OCS, which call it what you see,
[02:30:06] but that is a little bit of contention.
[02:30:10] I mean, OCS, I think they say,
[02:30:14] oh, well, we went to Plebe Summer.
[02:30:15] Well, guess what?
[02:30:16] Plebe Summer is not Marine Corps Officer Candidate School.
[02:30:20] Yeah, as you know, it's not even Naval Officer Candidate
[02:30:23] School.
[02:30:23] I don't know, I mean, I don't know.
[02:30:25] Yeah.
[02:30:26] I don't know.
[02:30:27] You said I know, I don't know.
[02:30:28] I know that Marine Corps OCS, or sorry, Navy OCS
[02:30:31] was cool and good indoctrination for me.
[02:30:34] I don't know how it compares to Plebe Summer or whatever.
[02:30:36] I don't know.
[02:30:37] But I'll take your word for it if you say
[02:30:39] it's not quite the same thing.
[02:30:40] Yeah, it's...
[02:30:42] I can tell you, I'd rather go through OCS
[02:30:43] than four years in the Naval Academy
[02:30:45] as far as just like grind.
[02:30:47] Yeah, any day of the week.
[02:30:50] So like the Marine OCS, so it's just like with anything else.
[02:30:54] They're gonna show up at TBS and,
[02:30:56] oh, I had to go through OCS and you guys didn't
[02:30:59] have to go through OCS.
[02:31:01] There was a lot of midshipmen that wanted to go through OCS
[02:31:05] because they had heard, you know what I mean?
[02:31:06] And I was just like, look guys, you know what I mean?
[02:31:08] So you don't go through OCS.
[02:31:10] What the shit?
[02:31:11] Yeah, you know what I mean?
[02:31:12] You've had four years at the Academy.
[02:31:13] Some of the folks that do go to OCS,
[02:31:15] they went to a regular college.
[02:31:16] They didn't have to put up with a lot of the crap
[02:31:18] that you guys are having to put up with
[02:31:20] while you're here.
[02:31:22] You know, you had to do summer cruises.
[02:31:23] You're competing for the ability to be a Marine officer,
[02:31:27] which is pretty cool.
[02:31:28] So we take them down to TBS
[02:31:30] and they call it Leatherneck.
[02:31:31] We call it purging the squid.
[02:31:34] Just because, you know, I mean,
[02:31:35] the Naval Academy is set up
[02:31:36] as a surface warfare officer school.
[02:31:38] I mean, that's what it is.
[02:31:39] You're making surface warfare officers.
[02:31:42] And there's no Marines in the brochure.
[02:31:44] So we take them down there and we put them through
[02:31:47] a little bit of the land navigation,
[02:31:49] a little bit of the field skills stuff,
[02:31:51] a little bit of the fire team and squad patrolling
[02:31:54] kind of thing.
[02:31:54] And then they've got Marine officers
[02:31:57] and they've got second lieutenants
[02:31:58] that just graduated TBS that work with the midshipmen.
[02:32:02] And they do evaluations on some of these kids
[02:32:05] to see how well they play with others.
[02:32:08] You know what I mean?
[02:32:08] How serious they are.
[02:32:09] How long is Leatherneck program?
[02:32:11] Leatherneck is, man, that's a good question.
[02:32:13] I might be like four to six weeks.
[02:32:17] It's really not that long.
[02:32:19] But neither is OCS.
[02:32:23] So they come down and they run through
[02:32:25] the Leatherneck program.
[02:32:27] And I got sent down to Quantico.
[02:32:34] At first there was a lot of content.
[02:32:35] Because people were like, oh, you got to do Pleep Summer.
[02:32:37] Everybody comes here, you got to do Pleep Summer.
[02:32:39] And I was like, well, General Allen said
[02:32:41] I didn't have to do Pleep Summer.
[02:32:42] And I'm going down to Quantico.
[02:32:43] What, just go watch Pleep Summer basically?
[02:32:45] Or monitor it?
[02:32:46] Yeah, like monitor at work.
[02:32:47] It is a senior enlisted.
[02:32:48] You know what I mean?
[02:32:49] It's kind of like indoctrination
[02:32:51] of being a senior enlisted.
[02:32:54] There was some cool guys that were up there at the academy.
[02:32:56] But I really wasn't into the whole chief's mess
[02:33:00] kind of thing.
[02:33:01] Like I didn't want to go downtown inapolis
[02:33:03] and do a pub crawl and that kind of stuff.
[02:33:08] So I didn't mix well with some of the other.
[02:33:11] I got along with a lot of the folks fine.
[02:33:12] I just, I didn't mix as well with a lot of the others.
[02:33:16] Some of them had that us versus them mentality.
[02:33:19] Us.
[02:33:20] Like us, the Covenant staff versus the midshipment.
[02:33:24] Let's sit around and see how much we can like make
[02:33:26] is miserable.
[02:33:27] Like dude, these kids got it miserable enough, man.
[02:33:30] And they're here.
[02:33:31] And just because they're coming to the academy.
[02:33:33] And yeah, it's a good gig.
[02:33:35] I mean, they get a lot of cool stuff at the academy.
[02:33:38] You know, they got like a silver spoon coming out
[02:33:41] of every orifice of their body.
[02:33:43] I mean, you know, who else gets to go on like summer
[02:33:45] camping trips and you get to go with like an air wing unit.
[02:33:48] You get to fly over.
[02:33:49] I mean, they do some cool stuff at the academy.
[02:33:52] And I think it's just jealousy of, you know,
[02:33:54] there's a lot of chiefs, gunnies, or, you know,
[02:33:57] they didn't get that opportunity and they just want to stick it
[02:34:00] to the midshipment as much as they can.
[02:34:02] And, you know, and like, like what they call like fry in them.
[02:34:06] Like basically like a NJP, but not NJP.
[02:34:10] They call it a fry.
[02:34:11] Well, all that's going to do to that kid.
[02:34:13] I mean, so the kid did something stupid.
[02:34:14] I mean, they're kids.
[02:34:16] That's going to hurt their order of merit.
[02:34:19] You know what I mean?
[02:34:19] Like unless they're doing something like grievous, you know what
[02:34:22] I mean?
[02:34:22] Like, like, come on, man.
[02:34:24] Like, you know, the kid was, you know, he's a kid.
[02:34:27] A lot of times I think some of the folks forget that that,
[02:34:30] you know, they didn't want to see JD when he was 18 and 19.
[02:34:35] And so, you know, those kind of folks, those us versus them
[02:34:39] mentality of, of with the midshipment.
[02:34:42] And I tell you what, the midshipment, they made my experience
[02:34:46] at the academy enjoyable.
[02:34:48] If it wasn't for them, it wouldn't have been as fun.
[02:34:52] Like I had a ball.
[02:34:53] So I ended up down at Leatherneck for the summer and they were
[02:34:56] going out to do simulations and, you know, CQB stuff, you know,
[02:34:59] coming in doing mouth at the mouth facility there.
[02:35:02] And, you know, a couple of the guys, the XO that was in charge,
[02:35:07] the major that was down there, his callsign was Pedro.
[02:35:10] He was a pilot, great guy, major Brown.
[02:35:14] And he's like, hey, why don't you come out, man, and play
[02:35:16] simulations with the midshipment while they're kind of taking
[02:35:19] them through the mouth.
[02:35:19] So I was like, yeah, I'm there.
[02:35:21] Like I love doing simulations in mouth.
[02:35:24] I mean, it's fun.
[02:35:25] You know what I mean?
[02:35:25] Yeah.
[02:35:26] And so we're up there and I ended up getting up in the third
[02:35:30] story and one of the rafters in one of the buildings and I'm
[02:35:34] making my way through the rafters, having a ball,
[02:35:38] shooting midshipment.
[02:35:39] Sniper.
[02:35:40] Yeah.
[02:35:40] I mean, just, and I'm slick.
[02:35:42] So I got no helmet on.
[02:35:44] Yeah, I got nothing.
[02:35:45] I'm just, I'm having a ball.
[02:35:46] It's a great day.
[02:35:49] And then beams break.
[02:35:52] I came out of the third story, fell three stories,
[02:35:55] and just hit like a second.
[02:35:59] You mean the beams break of the rafters that you're in?
[02:36:02] Yeah.
[02:36:03] You know how like the rafters are, when you go back and look
[02:36:06] at the rafters, they were, you know, it's government.
[02:36:08] They were just put in with like long stables.
[02:36:11] So the rafters weren't, but necessarily like for me to get,
[02:36:15] they were kind of like, how did they even get in the rafters?
[02:36:19] Because like when you went to the third story,
[02:36:20] there was just like a cutout.
[02:36:23] Like, you know, you got like a fake ceiling.
[02:36:25] Like a fake ceiling with the little cutout,
[02:36:27] like you have in some people's garages, you know what I mean?
[02:36:30] And you can push up and put a ladder in and put storage.
[02:36:32] So I just ran and hit the wall, jumped up, grabbed,
[02:36:35] pulled myself up and got up into the rafters.
[02:36:37] You know what I mean?
[02:36:38] So yeah, I got up there.
[02:36:40] And then once I was up in there, I was coming out
[02:36:42] and turkey peaking, trying to figure out where the midshipmen
[02:36:44] were moving around in the town and put my hand down.
[02:36:46] Boom, God rafters came out and I came down three stories.
[02:36:50] How come you went down three stories and not just falling from?
[02:36:54] Because you know how like the mount has like a building that
[02:36:56] looks like it's blown off?
[02:36:58] Yeah.
[02:36:59] Yeah.
[02:36:59] So there was nothing there.
[02:37:01] Oh, OK.
[02:37:01] So I'm out.
[02:37:05] And yeah, hit went down the hit with the left shoulder
[02:37:10] and then just down the left side of the body.
[02:37:12] So just and the bad thing was I didn't knock myself out.
[02:37:17] So I mean, you know, like when you go see the doc and they're
[02:37:20] like, so on a pain scale of one to 10, like where I was like,
[02:37:23] dude, yeah, this is a 10.
[02:37:25] Like, yes, it hurt.
[02:37:28] And they medivac me out and took me in and I shattered my left
[02:37:33] shoulder, broke a couple of ribs on the left side,
[02:37:37] broke my pelvis in three spots and the left ankle.
[02:37:43] And yeah, it was going from a hundred mile an hour to zero
[02:37:48] and in an instant.
[02:37:51] And it ended up in a wheelchair, which was that.
[02:37:57] That put a lot of stuff.
[02:37:58] Like I didn't like being in a wheelchair like, man, that.
[02:38:03] That was terrible.
[02:38:04] I mean, I was, I was coming on glued.
[02:38:09] Yeah, it was just, it was a bad, a bad time.
[02:38:12] You know, I didn't want to hear the whole, oh, everything
[02:38:14] happens for a reason kind of thing.
[02:38:15] Like that wasn't flying with me at the time.
[02:38:20] Just because I thought that, you know, something that I was
[02:38:24] hoping to do that fall was now gone.
[02:38:29] And then, you know, the Navy docs that are taking care of me,
[02:38:31] you know, they were, they were kind of great guys,
[02:38:33] but one of the Navy doctors, commander, you know, he was like,
[02:38:39] yeah, I don't, I don't know if you, you know, you're running
[02:38:42] and that kind of thing, that that's going to be happening.
[02:38:46] And I didn't like that of telling me that that's not going
[02:38:51] to happen.
[02:38:51] So I went in and at Walter Reed, they redid my shoulder the
[02:38:55] first time and I had to get like a bone graph and stuff put
[02:38:58] in and, and some screws.
[02:39:01] So I get that done at Walter Reed, which that was back,
[02:39:03] then when it was like a dungeon, you know, when, before it hit
[02:39:06] the news of how stuff went down, I come out of there and this
[02:39:12] happened in the summer of 2003 and January of 2004.
[02:39:18] I signed up and went with the Navy team to run the Disney
[02:39:21] marathon because I was like, yeah, I'm, I'm running.
[02:39:26] I had already been running being at the Naval Academy with
[02:39:31] their athletic department and the trainers and stuff that
[02:39:34] they had, man, they had me like Aqua jogging and resistance
[02:39:39] stuff, you know what I mean?
[02:39:40] And, and the elliptical and, and there was some, you know,
[02:39:43] some of the guys would come in because like Aqua jogging is
[02:39:46] boring as shit.
[02:39:47] You know what I mean?
[02:39:47] Like it's boring, but I'd have guys come in and get in the
[02:39:50] pool with me because I'm just trying to get back.
[02:39:53] I'm still focused like, hey, I still got a shot.
[02:39:56] You know what I mean?
[02:39:56] I can get better.
[02:39:59] So, you know, that happened in June, the summer and January.
[02:40:03] I went down and I ran a 319 Disney, not my best time, but
[02:40:09] I was, I was pretty stoked with a 319 and I came back with
[02:40:13] that big stupid Disney medal that they give you.
[02:40:16] I threw it on the commander's desk and I was like, there's
[02:40:19] your fucking PhD.
[02:40:21] Don't tell me I can't run.
[02:40:23] And of course that's going against doctors or orders kind
[02:40:26] of a thing. They got me a new doc, the new doc that I got.
[02:40:31] He was great.
[02:40:32] He was like, yeah, push your body.
[02:40:34] You know, the human body is an amazing machine.
[02:40:37] You can, you know, get yourself back.
[02:40:38] You get yourself fit.
[02:40:40] So I started next back in the pool swimming.
[02:40:43] I was over there.
[02:40:44] You know, the men's swim team was phenomenal.
[02:40:47] Navy, they got a really good swim program there and the
[02:40:49] coach was great.
[02:40:50] So I used to like to go in and swim with the team and I was
[02:40:53] in there swimming.
[02:40:53] I got out of the shower one day and I was, as I was like
[02:40:56] showering on my shoulder, like something was coming out the
[02:40:59] back of my shoulder.
[02:41:00] Well, so I go over to the football locker.
[02:41:02] They put the X right on.
[02:41:03] I got screws coming out back to the hospital.
[02:41:06] You know what I mean?
[02:41:07] My body was refusing some of the screws coming in.
[02:41:11] I went through rehab with that for the second shoulder
[02:41:16] operation and General Allen, he was kind of my sponsor.
[02:41:21] He had been moved on.
[02:41:22] He was up at the Pentagon. He's a one star up to Pentagon.
[02:41:25] And finally, you know, John Allen called me up to the
[02:41:27] Pentagon and he's like, because they put me up on a
[02:41:30] Navy board, Med.
[02:41:32] And I went up and, you know, John was like, where, where do
[02:41:37] you want to go?
[02:41:39] Because you're not, you're done.
[02:41:41] Like you're not, they were not going to pass you on any kind
[02:41:44] of jump physical, nothing, you know, make map.
[02:41:48] You know, even the shoulder had gotten bad enough to where
[02:41:51] they were like, dude, you keep monkeying around like you're
[02:41:53] going to lose mobility.
[02:41:56] So that kind of got the realism in there.
[02:42:00] And, you know, with him, I was hanging out at the academy
[02:42:03] and the next thing, you know, I got a call from the monitor.
[02:42:09] Medi Knox called me and I was actually at a bowl game in
[02:42:11] San Diego here with the Navy football and he called me and
[02:42:14] he's like, hey, JD, we'd like you to come back down to
[02:42:16] Quantico and, you know, oversee the schools because they had
[02:42:20] Sniper School, HRP, high rest personnel.
[02:42:23] It's basically pistol shooting and Savina Tire, small arms
[02:42:28] weapon instructor course in preacher school.
[02:42:31] So they asked me if I'd come back down and I was literally
[02:42:33] sitting right downtown San Diego and I'm like, dude, I'm in a
[02:42:36] bowl game with Navy football right now.
[02:42:39] You want me to come back?
[02:42:41] I don't want to come back.
[02:42:43] So I was like, hey, I'll call you when I get done.
[02:42:45] Out here, I came back and Medi Knox gave me my sergeant.
[02:42:50] He promoted me, gave me a pin up and pinned me on February
[02:42:54] 1st and I went back down to Quantico and gave him a couple
[02:42:58] more years back down at the schoolhouse as a mass sergeant
[02:43:02] and then left at 21.
[02:43:06] And I think it was good for me to be down there.
[02:43:11] The colonel that I was working for is Mike Mulligan's gray guy
[02:43:15] and Mike, you know, trying to get me ready for transition.
[02:43:19] Like, I didn't know this was not the plan.
[02:43:24] Yeah, I wanted to stay at camp as long as possible until I get
[02:43:28] like 30 years and then retire or make all the way to E-9
[02:43:33] because I was at E-8.
[02:43:34] And yeah, it wasn't a plan.
[02:43:37] So I really, I didn't know what I was going to do.
[02:43:43] And probably the biggest aspect of my wife, Tracy,
[02:43:51] at times she's like, you can do stuff.
[02:43:54] I mean, it's one thing she'll give me.
[02:43:55] She's like, you'll work.
[02:43:57] You're going to show up.
[02:43:59] You're going to work.
[02:44:00] And one of the guys that had taught me back in the day
[02:44:03] to cast my net widely, Eric Carlson, he called me
[02:44:07] and was like, hey, man, do you want
[02:44:08] to do some contract work with infantry weapons,
[02:44:12] special weapons, sniper rifle, stuff like that,
[02:44:15] you know, working for L3 communications.
[02:44:18] So he called me and I was like, yeah, do I have to like,
[02:44:20] you know, what do I have to do?
[02:44:21] He goes, well, you know, we got to have like a panel interview
[02:44:23] kind of thing.
[02:44:24] And so I go out to see Eric and everybody that's on the panel.
[02:44:28] I served with all of them in the Marine Corps.
[02:44:29] It was like a going home kind of thing.
[02:44:31] It was like, all these dudes are there.
[02:44:33] And it's just, this is preliminary.
[02:44:35] And so Eric, you know, brought me in and, I mean,
[02:44:41] he took care of me, gave me a job.
[02:44:44] Because again, I didn't really know what I was going to do.
[02:44:49] So how long did you do that contracting job for?
[02:44:51] A couple years.
[02:44:52] And then what, how did you end up forming OMNA,
[02:44:56] which is your, OMNA International,
[02:44:59] which is your leadership company?
[02:45:02] Is that the right thing to call it?
[02:45:04] Yeah, yeah, well, it's experiential.
[02:45:08] Right, experiential learning.
[02:45:09] Experiential learning.
[02:45:11] And so it was, it was at L3.
[02:45:15] And, you know, in the Marine Corps, you know,
[02:45:20] I had the opportunity because of some of the officers
[02:45:22] that I served with that let me tag along and go on some staff
[02:45:25] rides historically, which was like super, I mean, you know,
[02:45:29] going to over and study in Okinawa, the battle over there
[02:45:32] and seeing the reverse slope defense of the Japanese,
[02:45:35] like what we kind of went through, the Philippines,
[02:45:37] you know, the Korea, you know what I mean?
[02:45:39] So just reading and then getting to go to these places
[02:45:42] and actually stand on the exact spot where,
[02:45:46] where folks have been.
[02:45:47] And like I said, I had read quite a bit.
[02:45:50] You know, I remember reading, you know, Hackworth
[02:45:53] back in the day, you know, those kind of guys
[02:45:55] were just very influential on me in leadership.
[02:46:00] And it was just, you know, it was kind of like a,
[02:46:03] an experience to where, you know, it's not in a classroom.
[02:46:08] It's not you're actually on the field.
[02:46:10] It's very hands-on kind of learning
[02:46:15] and learning how to lead.
[02:46:17] And so I started with Omna of,
[02:46:23] it started to realize that we could do staff rides
[02:46:28] outside of the Marine Corps.
[02:46:34] Like there's a, there's, there's other organizations
[02:46:37] that are out there, you know, like at the Naval Academy,
[02:46:41] we used to take the kids to Antietam.
[02:46:43] You know what I mean?
[02:46:44] They could do it as a weekend trip.
[02:46:45] We could take them to Antietam.
[02:46:46] You know, John Allen, he was a big history guy,
[02:46:48] Marine officer, of course, love staff rides.
[02:46:51] You know, Gettysburg is another big one.
[02:46:54] Corporal Seamus Garry used to live up in Gettysburg up there.
[02:46:57] We called it Marine Barracks, Gettysburg.
[02:47:00] You know what I mean?
[02:47:01] So there was, you know, going to Gettysburg,
[02:47:03] the experiential stuff of overseas, you know,
[02:47:05] the Marine Corps was always big on this
[02:47:07] with doing staff rides.
[02:47:12] And they were a lot of fun.
[02:47:14] So again, this same guy, Eric Carlson had been dealing
[02:47:18] with the wildland firefighters,
[02:47:22] the guys, hotshots, smoke jumpers, engine crew,
[02:47:25] kind of guys.
[02:47:26] And I guess they had had a couple of fatality fires.
[02:47:29] So they did a tri-data study and they earmarked
[02:47:33] and went around and looked at different organizations
[02:47:36] of how they teach leadership.
[02:47:38] And they ended up at Marine Corps University
[02:47:41] and Eric Carlson was the operations officer.
[02:47:45] And Eric, and they called over and Craig Huddleston,
[02:47:49] who's with Omna as well.
[02:47:51] Craig is another one of my great mentors.
[02:47:53] Craig was over at Command and Staff.
[02:47:58] And they were like, hey, do you mind if some firefighter guys
[02:48:00] come tag along, go to Gettysburg?
[02:48:02] Sure, rang them along.
[02:48:04] So they went up to Gettysburg.
[02:48:05] And when they saw how the Marine Corps just took a pile
[02:48:09] of dirt of what we call a terrain model,
[02:48:11] they were like, wow, this is pretty cheap.
[02:48:13] We've got a lot of dirt.
[02:48:15] And there were so many similarities between
[02:48:18] wildland firefighting and the Marine Corps.
[02:48:21] You know, a hotshot is an infantry platoon.
[02:48:24] You know, an engine is like artillery.
[02:48:26] They've got aviation, they've got logistics,
[02:48:28] they've got, you know, incident commanders
[02:48:30] and they were putting people in harm's way.
[02:48:33] They're making plans, they're using terrain models
[02:48:35] and they're sending folks out
[02:48:36] just like on a military operation.
[02:48:39] So they really bought into this staff ride concept
[02:48:44] as well as the Naval Academy.
[02:48:47] You know, so the Naval Academy with Joe Thomas
[02:48:51] who's still up there with the leadership in ethics,
[02:48:53] Gray Guy, retired Marine Lieutenant Colonel, Pennsylvania guy,
[02:48:57] Joe and them, I mean, we've taken the Naval Academy
[02:48:59] up to Gettysburg because the team captains
[02:49:03] with the football and all the sports that were up there,
[02:49:07] were like, hey, we got a guy that can take the team captains
[02:49:11] and take them to Gettysburg.
[02:49:13] So, you know, through NAAA,
[02:49:16] I took the team captains up there
[02:49:18] because you know, I knew a lot of the coaches
[02:49:19] because obviously I spent a lot of time with their facilities.
[02:49:23] You know what I mean?
[02:49:24] Kind of playing around and I just started,
[02:49:26] like at first it was kind of a,
[02:49:31] kind of something fun to do,
[02:49:34] but I didn't know how to run a business.
[02:49:38] So I basically went online of,
[02:49:40] because you can find everything online
[02:49:42] and like, how do you start a business.com?
[02:49:45] And then, okay, well, you gotta pick a name,
[02:49:50] you gotta get a duns number, you gotta get a 10,
[02:49:52] you gotta get, you know, so there was a lot of reading
[02:49:55] involved because I had no clue,
[02:49:59] like how do you get a business license?
[02:50:01] I mean, it's just amazing, like,
[02:50:04] I became so more educated, you know what I mean,
[02:50:09] of just starting a business and getting QuickBooks.
[02:50:13] Like, how do you do taxes?
[02:50:14] How do you run payroll?
[02:50:16] Like, how do you, you know what I mean?
[02:50:17] Yeah, you wanna learn a lot of stuff,
[02:50:18] start some businesses, start a business,
[02:50:20] start with just one, you're gonna learn a lot.
[02:50:22] Yeah, I've just got one.
[02:50:24] Yeah, I know, yeah.
[02:50:27] But even like, I think the, well,
[02:50:29] I know the first business that I started
[02:50:31] was this gym that we're in today
[02:50:33] and just the amount of learning that you do.
[02:50:36] And then, you know, your next business,
[02:50:37] you already have some of those lessons learning,
[02:50:39] you can apply them and then the next business after that,
[02:50:41] when you can apply some more and yeah,
[02:50:43] but if you're a young person or you just got out of,
[02:50:47] you know, the service, you start a business.
[02:50:50] I don't care if you do, you know,
[02:50:51] you sell, you know, clothes pins or something,
[02:50:54] painted clothes pins.
[02:50:55] If you start a business, just sell painted clothes pins,
[02:50:58] you're gonna learn a ton, you're gonna learn a ton.
[02:51:00] And you might make some money along the way,
[02:51:02] you might lose some money, but you're gonna learn a lot.
[02:51:03] That's for sure.
[02:51:05] And this is how you and I eventually linked up
[02:51:08] because at Escalon Front, we wanted to do
[02:51:11] what we call EF Battlefield
[02:51:12] and we wanted to have, you know,
[02:51:14] an expert that has more knowledge
[02:51:16] about the battles than we do.
[02:51:19] And that's how we linked up for the first time,
[02:51:22] which was awesome.
[02:51:23] Yeah, yeah, so we started out,
[02:51:26] so I've had the company since 2010.
[02:51:30] And Omna stands for one man national asset.
[02:51:35] And I learned from Al Gray
[02:51:39] that before you decide what you're gonna do,
[02:51:42] decide who you're doing it with.
[02:51:45] And, you know, Eric Carlson, the same guy,
[02:51:49] I mean, he's, of course,
[02:51:52] I'm gonna do everything with Eric Carlson.
[02:51:54] I lived three quarters of a mile from Eric Carlson,
[02:51:57] still to this day.
[02:51:58] I run past his house in the morning.
[02:52:00] I mean, he is a huge impact.
[02:52:02] And now Craig Huddleston,
[02:52:06] Craig Huddleston is the most interesting man in the world.
[02:52:08] He went from E1 to E7 to 01 to 06.
[02:52:16] A little over 33.
[02:52:17] He was a drill instructor.
[02:52:19] I mean, he's just like,
[02:52:20] he's like one of those guys that just did everything.
[02:52:23] You know what I mean?
[02:52:24] He did a tour with the British War Commandos over in Europe.
[02:52:27] I mean, he's just the most interesting man in the world.
[02:52:30] And, you know, he's, it's still a downhill ski instructor
[02:52:34] at Angel Fire, New Mexico.
[02:52:35] He's in his 70s.
[02:52:36] I mean, you wouldn't know it.
[02:52:38] The guy is just, he doesn't stop.
[02:52:41] Huge impact on me in my life.
[02:52:44] And then all the other guys that work with Omnit,
[02:52:48] you know, of course, you know, we start out with Marines.
[02:52:52] And then we started expanding to where like in Wildland Fire,
[02:52:55] they were like, can we develop staff rides for Wildland Fire?
[02:52:59] So you got like South Canyon Fatality Fires.
[02:53:03] The Dude Fire down in Arizona,
[02:53:06] you've got what the movie came out with, Only the Brave,
[02:53:10] was about the Yarno Hill Fire.
[02:53:12] We developed that staff ride.
[02:53:13] That's what I was just at last week doing those.
[02:53:16] Because like I said, I mean, it's experiential leadership.
[02:53:20] And it's not necessarily,
[02:53:21] it's armchair quarterbacking the events,
[02:53:23] but you're not there to refight the fire or refight the battle.
[02:53:26] You're there to take a step back
[02:53:28] and look at the leadership decisions that were made.
[02:53:33] And how could we learn from that?
[02:53:35] How can we move forward?
[02:53:38] And then like teaming up with you guys, you know what I mean?
[02:53:41] Like I can remember when I first,
[02:53:43] when like Steve and Jason who I love,
[02:53:46] because they are just class act characters.
[02:53:50] Like when we got done with the first staff ride,
[02:53:54] you know, a few years back,
[02:53:55] and we're sitting in the room and they're like,
[02:53:59] dude, this was so much fun.
[02:54:01] Like the interaction with the participants
[02:54:05] that are there, the people that you get to meet.
[02:54:08] I mean, you remember, I mean, some of the folks,
[02:54:10] I mean, they even came back and did little big horn works.
[02:54:12] You know, and just the experience
[02:54:16] on the leadership aspect of experiencing it that there,
[02:54:20] to me, you just, you can't get it from a classroom.
[02:54:23] You can't get it from a book.
[02:54:25] You know, when you're standing, you know,
[02:54:27] in the Peach Orchard at Gettysburg,
[02:54:30] and the discussions that you're having of,
[02:54:33] I mean, everybody has a dance circles
[02:54:35] in their organization.
[02:54:36] Everybody, it's just for 10,000 years,
[02:54:38] we've been trying to figure out how to deal with people.
[02:54:41] And delivering of a staff ride, it's so memorable,
[02:54:45] like of being there.
[02:54:47] And you know, it's just so,
[02:54:50] we basically developed a business
[02:54:52] around experiential staff rides.
[02:54:56] And, you know, and we do it for, you know, fish and wildlife,
[02:55:01] US Forest Service, FDNY, San Diego Lifeguards,
[02:55:06] I took the San Diego Lifeguards, the Gettysburg,
[02:55:08] which was like super cool.
[02:55:10] Like those are a great bunch of guys.
[02:55:12] And I learned more from them than they probably did for me.
[02:55:15] Like I didn't know they were sworn officers
[02:55:17] and could write tickets, but they don't get a gun.
[02:55:19] Talk about the ability to use your, you know,
[02:55:22] your communication skills.
[02:55:23] You better be pretty good.
[02:55:25] You know what I mean?
[02:55:26] And, you know, bringing them to Gettysburg,
[02:55:27] everybody's like, you know, in Gettysburg,
[02:55:29] like who are these, it's like their lifeguards,
[02:55:31] like from San Diego, like, I mean, the whole Baywatch.
[02:55:34] I mean, the guys are just phenomenal people.
[02:55:38] And then we do a lot, Orange County,
[02:55:39] like I know you've done stuff with Orange County,
[02:55:41] fire authority up the road.
[02:55:43] But then when you meet like the smoke jumpers
[02:55:45] and the hotshots, that's like kind of like these people,
[02:55:48] like if we would have had Discovery Channel,
[02:55:50] like when you and I were kids in the 80s
[02:55:52] and I would have seen like, wait a minute,
[02:55:54] I can get paid money to get a chainsaw,
[02:55:56] which are always fun to operate.
[02:55:59] And you're gonna let me jump out of an aircraft
[02:56:02] in the middle of nowhere and fight fire.
[02:56:04] And I'm gonna get paid.
[02:56:06] Like that's badass.
[02:56:08] And just like with the hotshots,
[02:56:10] I mean, we're gonna put me in a buggy.
[02:56:11] We're gonna ride around with like 20 to 30 other men
[02:56:15] and women that just wanna get after it,
[02:56:18] you know what I mean?
[02:56:18] With a Pulaski, you know what I mean?
[02:56:21] And fight wild land fire.
[02:56:23] I mean, they're just great people.
[02:56:27] They provide a great service to the country.
[02:56:30] But growing up in Virginia, West Virginia,
[02:56:32] we don't have wild land fire like here.
[02:56:35] I mean, like everybody out here,
[02:56:36] you all in Cali know what wild land fire is.
[02:56:39] It's the West Coast thing.
[02:56:40] Yeah, but yeah, that would be such a cool job.
[02:56:45] And they're just great people.
[02:56:47] Yeah, that's a freaking hard job, man.
[02:56:49] You and I were talking earlier today
[02:56:51] and just when you've been in the military
[02:56:53] and you look at a hill
[02:56:56] and you know what it takes to walk up a hill,
[02:56:58] you appreciate hills.
[02:57:00] And those wild land fire guys, man,
[02:57:02] they just actually, I have a guy that guided me
[02:57:04] a couple of hunts and he's a wild land fire guy.
[02:57:07] And I mean, you wanna talk about a dude
[02:57:09] that could hoof out some miles, bro?
[02:57:11] I mean, this dude was just like, okay.
[02:57:14] I mean, with no expression on his face, you know,
[02:57:17] other than like, where are we going next?
[02:57:21] No factor, like no factor.
[02:57:23] This guy's put some miles in, man.
[02:57:24] These are like mountain goats.
[02:57:26] They're like mountain goats.
[02:57:26] Yeah, I mean, and they, with like gas cans
[02:57:29] and they got like chainsaws.
[02:57:32] And they do, I mean, it's a,
[02:57:34] and they're just a great community of people.
[02:57:37] So I had the experience, I do a lot with those folks
[02:57:40] and they've expanded to where now with Omna,
[02:57:42] now we've got former, I got a former hotshots,
[02:57:45] former wild land firefighters.
[02:57:47] They got former forest ranger.
[02:57:49] You know what I mean?
[02:57:50] That she works with us.
[02:57:52] I mean, just the people that I've had the opportunity
[02:57:56] to meet over the past 12 years of doing this.
[02:58:00] I mean, it's just, it's amazing.
[02:58:02] And of course, like I enjoy the hell out of it,
[02:58:04] which makes it even better.
[02:58:06] You know, what I don't have to go to a cubicle.
[02:58:09] And you know what I mean?
[02:58:10] We get the, and you know, it's like my wife's like,
[02:58:12] what are you doing over there?
[02:58:14] I'm working.
[02:58:15] Allegedly.
[02:58:16] No, you're reading a book.
[02:58:17] That's my job.
[02:58:19] I get to read.
[02:58:20] Well, you know, we were lucky enough to link up
[02:58:24] and we bring a lot of corporate people in.
[02:58:28] We bring everyone in, a lot of corporate people,
[02:58:30] a lot of business people in that go through these staff rides
[02:58:33] and pass on these lessons learned.
[02:58:36] And there's so much to learn from these events
[02:58:39] and the leadership and the personalities
[02:58:41] and the people that undergo them.
[02:58:44] And I was talking to you and I always feel
[02:58:49] kind of selfish because I get to hang out with you.
[02:58:51] And I was, and learn from these battlefields
[02:58:55] and from these battles.
[02:58:55] And I thought to myself, hey,
[02:58:57] maybe we should try and extend this knowledge
[02:58:59] to more people.
[02:59:00] So I came up with an idea of doing a series of podcasts
[02:59:05] about the Civil War battles.
[02:59:07] And just so everybody knows, that's what we're doing.
[02:59:11] We're gonna put together a series of podcasts
[02:59:14] about the Civil War, where it's gonna be on this,
[02:59:16] it's gonna be on this podcast feed.
[02:59:18] It's gonna be Jocko podcast, Civil War Excursion.
[02:59:23] Cause it's gonna, you know, there's some people that make,
[02:59:24] I don't really feel like listening to Civil War.
[02:59:27] And if you don't wanna listen to it, that's fine.
[02:59:29] You probably will.
[02:59:30] It's sitting here talking to you.
[02:59:34] It's like trying to, I can't wait.
[02:59:36] I can't wait to pull the string on your back
[02:59:38] where you just start talking about Civil War
[02:59:40] and battles and personalities, man, it's awesome.
[02:59:43] And yeah, you'll be hearing a bunch from JD on this feed.
[02:59:50] Yeah.
[02:59:50] What do we miss?
[02:59:51] We miss anything else?
[02:59:53] No, that's pretty much it.
[02:59:57] I remember when I talked to you like one of the first times
[03:00:00] when your book came out Extreme Ownership,
[03:00:02] and of course I'd read it.
[03:00:04] And I had some of the folks that I deal with
[03:00:06] that that was like a pre-read.
[03:00:10] You know, cause a lot of the people that we deal with,
[03:00:12] we encourage reading lists in any organization.
[03:00:16] Like everybody should read.
[03:00:19] And that was one of the books, Extreme Ownership,
[03:00:22] prior to us going to Little Bighorn.
[03:00:23] So, and when you actually look at it after the fact,
[03:00:27] and being with you and all the guys with Eshalon Front
[03:00:30] and doing it now, when you look at like the battlefield,
[03:00:33] you could be like, well, that definitely did not
[03:00:37] show any Extreme Ownership.
[03:00:38] Oh yeah.
[03:00:39] You know what I mean?
[03:00:40] It's crazy to go out and, you know, I used to tell the platoons
[03:00:43] when I was taking a platoon to Land Warfare
[03:00:45] or urban training, I'd say, look,
[03:00:47] I know the mistakes you're gonna make.
[03:00:48] I already know the mistakes you're gonna make.
[03:00:50] And you're not gonna cover and move.
[03:00:52] You're gonna make things too complicated.
[03:00:54] You're not, you're gonna have,
[03:00:55] trying to do too many things at once.
[03:00:56] You're gonna have centralized command.
[03:00:58] Everything's gonna fall apart.
[03:01:00] If you follow these simple rules, you're gonna do good.
[03:01:03] And it's so crazy to look back at history
[03:01:06] and look back at Gettysburg or Little Bighorn.
[03:01:09] And you can say, oh, no cover and move right here.
[03:01:10] Everything falls apart.
[03:01:11] Oh, they had too complicated.
[03:01:12] Everything falls apart.
[03:01:13] Oh, trying to do too many things at once.
[03:01:15] Everything falls apart.
[03:01:16] Oh, the commander's trying to direct every single person.
[03:01:19] Everything falls apart.
[03:01:20] The same mistakes get made in the Civil War,
[03:01:24] in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, any war, pretty much.
[03:01:29] The same mistakes get made.
[03:01:30] The same leadership makes mistakes get made.
[03:01:33] And what's crazy is that the same leadership mistakes
[03:01:35] get made in any organization, in any organization.
[03:01:39] It's they don't support each other.
[03:01:40] They make things too complicated.
[03:01:42] They don't figure out their priorities.
[03:01:43] They don't focus their efforts.
[03:01:45] And they try and centralize and control everything.
[03:01:48] And all those things are bad.
[03:01:50] And when you come out,
[03:01:52] and we, the next thing we're doing with you,
[03:01:54] let me look at the dates here.
[03:01:55] It's, what do we got?
[03:01:59] Next battlefield is March 21st through the 23rd
[03:02:03] on the hollowed grounds of Gettysburg.
[03:02:06] You know, there is a whole,
[03:02:08] like I said, this was Jason, you know, when Jason was on,
[03:02:10] there's like a spiritual side to this.
[03:02:12] There's a leadership side, sure,
[03:02:14] but you go on to that battlefield
[03:02:16] and you feel the sacrifice that was made.
[03:02:22] And it's very powerful.
[03:02:25] Both at Gettysburg and Little Big Horn,
[03:02:27] and I'm sure we're gonna do a bunch of other battlefields
[03:02:29] in the future.
[03:02:30] But if anybody wants to come,
[03:02:31] to walk the battlefield with us,
[03:02:35] escalonfront.com, check out the next EF battlefield.
[03:02:39] It's March 21st through the 23rd.
[03:02:43] For your company, for Omna, it's theomna.com.
[03:02:49] So you do stuff all over the place.
[03:02:51] You run a bunch of these events.
[03:02:53] Your people run a bunch of these events.
[03:02:55] You're on Instagram, Omna underscore international.
[03:02:58] You're on Facebook, Omna international LLC.
[03:03:02] That's, if people wanna find you,
[03:03:04] that's where they can find you.
[03:03:06] And that's where they can find some of the courses
[03:03:08] that you guys are running, which is awesome.
[03:03:11] What else, Echo, you got anything?
[03:03:12] You got any questions?
[03:03:13] Oh, what year again were you at Navy?
[03:03:16] I was at Navy 2003 and left 2006.
[03:03:20] Oh, damn, because we'd play them a lot.
[03:03:22] I played at Universal Hawaii,
[03:03:23] so that we were in the same conference.
[03:03:26] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:03:27] That's where I was the head coach at Navy, Ken.
[03:03:30] Neymar, he quarterbacked at Hawaii.
[03:03:33] Did you play in the Naval Academy?
[03:03:35] You played against them?
[03:03:37] I didn't play the game, no.
[03:03:38] But we played that man the team did,
[03:03:40] but I personally did not.
[03:03:41] You were on the bench, kinda?
[03:03:42] I was on the bench, I was red-shirting.
[03:03:44] Oh, sure.
[03:03:45] But yeah, that was a little bit before that time, no.
[03:03:48] 95 to 98.
[03:03:50] Oh, okay, yeah.
[03:03:51] Did you get special treatment
[03:03:52] at University of Hawaii being on the football team?
[03:03:54] Yes, yeah, they do.
[03:03:56] And that makes sense too,
[03:03:58] because a lot of times football brings in a lot of the money.
[03:04:01] So you have that dynamic for sure.
[03:04:04] Yeah, when you look at the football division one,
[03:04:07] to compete, I can remember,
[03:04:09] I had a lot of cool opportunities.
[03:04:11] Like I got to travel with the team.
[03:04:13] So like we go play Notre Dame.
[03:04:16] I mean, that's big school, man.
[03:04:18] That's a big program.
[03:04:19] You know what I mean?
[03:04:20] So I'm over, because I'm a gunny,
[03:04:22] I can just go wherever I want.
[03:04:24] So I go over to their locker room.
[03:04:26] The size of those dudes,
[03:04:28] like compared to the Naval Academy of the Chittester,
[03:04:31] you know what I mean?
[03:04:32] They were tree trunks, man.
[03:04:33] These dudes were,
[03:04:34] I walk back over one of the quarterbacks
[03:04:36] at Navy, Craig Candido.
[03:04:38] I went over to Craig and I was like,
[03:04:40] dude, I'm glad I'm not you today, bro.
[03:04:43] Because you're running triple option football.
[03:04:46] JD's pep talk, I'm glad I'm not you.
[03:04:49] I mean, they should have sent you back to be,
[03:04:52] back to Annapolis after that pep talk.
[03:04:55] I mean, those dudes, I mean, that's,
[03:04:58] and that's where, you know,
[03:04:59] when you're talking about like having these kids there
[03:05:02] compete at that level, like you at Hawaii,
[03:05:04] I mean, it's a different,
[03:05:06] that's just a different level of competition,
[03:05:08] playing those folks, man.
[03:05:09] There's some big, and those guys,
[03:05:12] that's all they do is play football.
[03:05:13] They're not doing double E and, you know,
[03:05:15] worried about height weight requirements
[03:05:17] and service selection.
[03:05:18] They're there to play football and go pro.
[03:05:20] Yeah, though, that's interesting how you talk about
[03:05:23] a guy will be on the O line or the D line,
[03:05:24] then he has to go change his whole body.
[03:05:26] I was like, bro, that's true.
[03:05:28] You can't be six, four, two, 90, over 300 pounds
[03:05:31] and then want to run, you know, all these mountain bats.
[03:05:34] It's not like that.
[03:05:34] You got to become a different human.
[03:05:36] You got to become a different human being.
[03:05:38] Like getting change your DNA is what it boils down to.
[03:05:42] Yeah, that's true.
[03:05:43] I mean, I played a skill position,
[03:05:45] but even like running three miles,
[03:05:49] you're talking about eight miles,
[03:05:50] marathons, all that, bro, I couldn't do that.
[03:05:53] I could sprint pretty fast, but man,
[03:05:55] the long distance is like a different kind of running.
[03:05:58] Yeah, they used to do something called fourth quarters
[03:06:01] and getting ready.
[03:06:03] So it was kind of like they'd show up in the morning
[03:06:05] out on the field and they would have stations.
[03:06:08] Yeah, circuits.
[03:06:09] Like fourth quarter circuit kind of stuff.
[03:06:10] Well, you know, so I go and of course I've got cleats.
[03:06:14] I've got everything, like I've got everything the kids have.
[03:06:16] Like I love going to practice, you know what I mean?
[03:06:19] And so I'm going to go do fourth quarters with the team.
[03:06:22] So first day I go out and I pick skills players to go with.
[03:06:25] Wrong move.
[03:06:27] They're these guys, they're fast twitch muscles, man.
[03:06:29] They're making me look silly.
[03:06:31] You know what I mean?
[03:06:32] And they weigh twice as much as you.
[03:06:33] Oh yeah.
[03:06:34] So the next day I'm going with O-line.
[03:06:39] I went to one of my seal buddies with friends
[03:06:41] with a bunch of San Diego Chargers
[03:06:43] and I went to his wedding and dude,
[03:06:45] these guys are just not, they're like a different species.
[03:06:48] It's like when you look at a Chihuahua versus like a great
[03:06:51] Dane and you think, how do these the same kind of animal?
[03:06:54] I'm standing around looking at these dudes going,
[03:06:56] how are these guys the same kind of animals to me?
[03:06:58] Cause I don't like this at all.
[03:07:00] Yeah.
[03:07:01] Yeah.
[03:07:02] I remember there was like one of the,
[03:07:03] I think it was one of the Chargers here training with Sarge
[03:07:06] and he was just teaching them some little bit of Jiu-Jitsu stuff.
[03:07:09] And I looked at him and he was like,
[03:07:10] I forget, I might've been a fullback or something.
[03:07:13] And I remember looking at him and I said,
[03:07:14] man, I forget, I forgot how big football players are.
[03:07:17] And even thinking back, I know the numbers.
[03:07:19] Like I know like my friend Jeff, he was,
[03:07:21] he actually ended up playing for the 49ers.
[03:07:23] Jeff Ulberg, he was six one, two, 55 and he ran a four, five.
[03:07:28] And I remember at the time I'm thinking like,
[03:07:30] oh man, he's pretty fast for like being a big, you know, guy,
[03:07:33] but he's not big compared to like the D line
[03:07:35] or the O line or whatever.
[03:07:36] But man, me thinking about that right now,
[03:07:39] but I'm not used to that kind of size anymore.
[03:07:41] Usually it's just normal.
[03:07:42] And running a four, five at 255, like when that guy hits you,
[03:07:46] oh yeah.
[03:07:47] That's not, that's not cool.
[03:07:49] Bro, you're going down.
[03:07:51] Like you're going down.
[03:07:52] You're going down.
[03:07:53] That's just pure power.
[03:07:55] Oh yeah.
[03:07:56] Yeah, these big Simone guys too.
[03:07:57] Six, five, three, 30, three, 40.
[03:08:01] And still fast.
[03:08:02] The giant.
[03:08:03] Oh yeah.
[03:08:04] Yeah.
[03:08:05] These pulling guards that come there just like this big mass
[03:08:07] of a human.
[03:08:08] Oh man.
[03:08:09] Yeah, it's, I forget how big they are.
[03:08:11] Yeah, that's why we invented gun power.
[03:08:14] Oh yeah.
[03:08:15] Oh yeah.
[03:08:16] Of course.
[03:08:19] Anything else, anything else JD?
[03:08:22] We're going to get a big dose of you on the podcast here.
[03:08:27] Anything else from you?
[03:08:30] Let's talk about how to support this podcast.
[03:08:34] How to support America, right?
[03:08:36] And of course, want to support ourselves.
[03:08:38] Speaking of being jacked.
[03:08:42] Good tool for being jacked, creatine.
[03:08:44] Yes.
[03:08:45] Creatine is out.
[03:08:45] Creatine is out.
[03:08:46] We just came out with creatine.
[03:08:47] That's good.
[03:08:48] How long were you thinking about doing that?
[03:08:51] Cause I remember the idea came up a long time ago.
[03:08:53] Yeah, yeah.
[03:08:54] Just the idea.
[03:08:55] It was one of those things where we had to be able to do it
[03:08:58] at a scale where it made sense.
[03:09:00] Because, because we, I don't just want to be like,
[03:09:03] oh, we'll just throw our name in the hat
[03:09:05] with everybody else.
[03:09:06] I want to make it good and all that stuff.
[03:09:08] But yeah, it's been, it's been a,
[03:09:10] it's probably been a few years that we were,
[03:09:12] had that in the, in the queue.
[03:09:15] It makes sense.
[03:09:15] Cause it is one of those supplements
[03:09:17] that's like reliably good.
[03:09:19] Kind of across the board, you know?
[03:09:21] All right. It's crazy.
[03:09:22] But on that little video you made when you're like,
[03:09:25] yeah, in the nineties and it's weird.
[03:09:26] That's when I really heard about it the most.
[03:09:28] Yeah. What's cool is that that's,
[03:09:30] I remember when it came out.
[03:09:33] It came out and I remember it.
[03:09:36] Everyone's like, dude, creatine, creatine, creatine.
[03:09:38] And what I got on creatine, I was on deployment
[03:09:40] on the USS Cleveland, the steaming cleave.
[03:09:45] And I brought cruise boxes with this protein powder
[03:09:48] that had creatine in it.
[03:09:50] And this is the one that I talk about where it's vanilla.
[03:09:52] I don't even like vanilla to this day
[03:09:53] cause I drank vanilla protein shakes
[03:09:55] for six straight months.
[03:09:57] And I would hold my nose like it was bad tequila
[03:10:00] and just like, got it down.
[03:10:02] You don't have to do that anymore.
[03:10:03] You can get Johncofuel.com, get your creatine, get jacked.
[03:10:08] The other cool thing is they've done so much research on it now.
[03:10:10] It like helps, it just doesn't only help you get stronger.
[03:10:14] Helps your athletic performance.
[03:10:15] Helps your cognitive function.
[03:10:17] Like it's just straight good for you.
[03:10:20] So if you want to get some of that,
[03:10:22] Johncofuel.com.
[03:10:23] And that's not to mention resistance training,
[03:10:25] all the studies that they've been putting into that.
[03:10:27] All the benefits of resistance training.
[03:10:29] So now you got the creatine supporting the resistance
[03:10:31] training, supporting all the other functions of your body.
[03:10:33] Yeah, resistance training, Jack.
[03:10:35] Resistance training, no offense JD.
[03:10:36] Because I know you're a runner.
[03:10:38] Do you jack steel at all?
[03:10:39] No, I just, calisthenics?
[03:10:41] Yeah, I do pull ups.
[03:10:42] I got a pull up bar.
[03:10:44] Yeah, pull ups, calisthenics.
[03:10:45] That's resistance.
[03:10:46] That's just old school Marine Corps.
[03:10:47] Yeah, no jacking of steel.
[03:10:49] Jacking of steel.
[03:10:50] You jacked your shoulder.
[03:10:51] No, you're not jacking steel.
[03:10:54] What else?
[03:10:56] Discipline go, right?
[03:10:57] Energy drink, redefined, healthy, all good stuff,
[03:11:00] no bad stuff.
[03:11:01] Can you imagine just having something that's got no downside?
[03:11:04] How legit is that?
[03:11:06] It's very legit.
[03:11:07] That's the legit here.
[03:11:08] No downside, there's no price to pay.
[03:11:10] Oh, it costs three bucks or whatever.
[03:11:13] Oh yeah, like everything else.
[03:11:14] There's no price to pay physically, health wise.
[03:11:17] Same thing with a ready to drink milk.
[03:11:18] Did you get a shipment yet?
[03:11:20] Yes, I did.
[03:11:20] Ha ha ha.
[03:11:22] It's a game changer.
[03:11:22] My kids are stealing them.
[03:11:24] It's gonna be gone.
[03:11:25] It's gonna be gone.
[03:11:26] There's no way you can have ready to drink milk
[03:11:27] in the house with children.
[03:11:28] I had to make a rule, straight up rule.
[03:11:30] Like you're not allowed to have these kind of things.
[03:11:32] The off limits.
[03:11:33] Yeah, off limits.
[03:11:34] Those are just for you.
[03:11:34] Oh yeah.
[03:11:35] You can't drink it all, straight up.
[03:11:37] That's why I made the rule.
[03:11:39] Well, we're making as much as we can.
[03:11:41] We got it on the web.
[03:11:43] So yeah, the ready to drink milk, it's freaking awesome.
[03:11:46] It's a game, it's kind of a game changer.
[03:11:48] It is kind of a game changer.
[03:11:50] You know why I think it's a game changer?
[03:11:51] Because man, there's no reason to eat anything else.
[03:11:55] Like, you know maybe you're walking by,
[03:11:57] no, you know what I'm saying?
[03:11:58] Like you're walking by the fridge and you're like,
[03:12:00] well what can I have right now?
[03:12:02] And you're kind of, everything's an effort
[03:12:04] and it's got the downside, you know?
[03:12:06] With a mulk, ready to drink.
[03:12:08] There's no, there's zero, once again, no downside.
[03:12:10] You don't have to make it.
[03:12:12] You just have to twist the freaking cap off, bro.
[03:12:14] You're in.
[03:12:15] You're correct about that.
[03:12:17] So get yourself some ready to drink milk.
[03:12:19] Get yourself some creatine.
[03:12:21] Go, discipline, go.
[03:12:23] Jockofuel.com at Wawa, you're in Virginia.
[03:12:26] You're going into Wawa.
[03:12:27] Just get you cleaning the shelves out.
[03:12:29] They're cleaned out like all the time.

[03:13:02] MorganUSA.com.

[03:13:16] This could go a while.
[03:13:17] Here's the thing, all made in America.
[03:13:20] Right now you're seeing some stuff on the news right now.
[03:13:21] You're seeing in China there's a practical revolution
[03:13:24] happening right now.
[03:13:27] They got workers rebelling, slave labor rebelling.
[03:13:30] It's about time.
[03:13:31] Well, that's China.
[03:13:34] That's where your clothes are getting made
[03:13:37] if you're not buying from originUSA.com.
[03:13:40] You're enabling slave labor to happen.
[03:13:44] So don't do it.
[03:13:45] Get the best quality stuff.
[03:13:48] Get the best quality stuff made in America.
[03:13:51] Don't support slave labor.
[03:13:53] That's what I got for you, originUSA.com.
[03:13:55] It's true.
[03:13:56] Also, Jocko's a store called Jocko's Store.
[03:13:57] Did I say geese?
[03:13:58] Did I say jujujuju?
[03:13:59] Yeah, you do.
[03:14:00] I was talking to some jujuju.
[03:14:01] I was talking to someone who was like, brah.
[03:14:03] When you put an origin jujutsu-gi on,
[03:14:06] it's a totally different thing.
[03:14:09] It's a different thing.
[03:14:11] It's like you were driving in a Camry.
[03:14:15] Sure.
[03:14:16] No offense against Camrys, right?
[03:14:18] Apparently.
[03:14:19] But then you got put into a Cadillac.
[03:14:23] You know what I'm saying?
[03:14:24] I know what you're saying.
[03:14:24] Next level.
[03:14:25] It's a different thing.
[03:14:26] It's a different experience.
[03:14:27] Yeah, that's a good analogy.
[03:14:28] Hey, your brother used to have a Prius.
[03:14:31] Right?
[03:14:31] Does he still have it?
[03:14:32] No.
[03:14:33] See, he had that Prius.
[03:14:34] I didn't know what to think of a Prius, right?
[03:14:36] Because I'd never been in one.
[03:14:38] I got in his Prius.
[03:14:39] Bro, that thing was-
[03:14:40] You didn't like that?
[03:14:41] No, that thing was foolish.
[03:14:42] Foolish?
[03:14:44] I know it gets good mileage and whatnot.
[03:14:46] No, but I mean, it felt like economy class.
[03:14:51] Yes, it was very economy class.
[03:14:54] I'm sure there's different levels of interior of Prius.
[03:14:56] I'm sure that's my assumption.
[03:14:57] I don't know.
[03:14:58] I don't know how many Priuses I've ever been in
[03:15:00] besides his, but I think-
[03:15:03] Like you hit the bump and you feel it.
[03:15:05] Oh, the whole deal?
[03:15:06] Yeah, you're right.
[03:15:07] It's economy class.
[03:15:08] Yeah, it's different.
[03:15:09] It's different.
[03:15:10] So don't do that, man.
[03:15:11] Don't get an economy class, Guy.
[03:15:13] No.
[03:15:14] Get a first class, Guy.
[03:15:14] Yeah.
[03:15:15] Yeah, you're gonna feel the difference, for sure.
[03:15:17] Especially when you gotta roll around in that thing,
[03:15:18] two people trying to choke you with it.
[03:15:20] You will not.
[03:15:21] It's gonna make a difference.
[03:15:21] Hey, if you travel first class
[03:15:23] and then you go back to economy, you hate it.
[03:15:25] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:15:26] It's the same thing here.
[03:15:26] You put on the origin, Guy.
[03:15:29] You're in first class.
[03:15:29] Then you go back into an economy, Guy.
[03:15:31] You're gonna hate it.
[03:15:32] It's gonna be pretty much the same.
[03:15:33] And once again, you're also gonna know
[03:15:34] in your subconscious mind that a 14-year-old girl
[03:15:39] in a slavery position was forced to make your Guy
[03:15:43] at gunpoint.
[03:15:44] 14 hours a day.
[03:15:45] 14 hours a day.
[03:15:46] Yeah, damn.
[03:15:48] So just keep that in mind, originUSA.com.
[03:15:51] Yeah, on that.
[03:15:53] Also, Joggle Store, if you wanna represent on the past,

[03:17:34] But I can't just rely on that.
[03:17:36] We all can't just rely on the benevolence
[03:17:41] of these people that have no vested interest
[03:17:44] in what we're doing.
[03:17:44] In fact, sometimes it could be conceived
[03:17:46] that they have a vested interest
[03:17:48] in not supporting what we're doing.
[03:17:49] I'm just saying.

[03:18:50] Years ago, this wasn't even conceivable thing.
[03:18:52] It would just seem like, oh, how can you learn something
[03:18:55] over the internet?
[03:18:58] But Echo Charles, you know those videos that you make?
[03:19:01] Yeah, I do.
[03:19:02] Where'd you learn how to do that?
[03:19:03] Mostly the internet.

[03:19:05] A lot of on the job training as well.
[03:19:09] Well, you don't feel, sorry, in the field.

[03:20:02] Oh yeah.
[03:20:03] International, Facebook, O-M-N-A.
[03:20:06] You just call it omna, huh?
[03:20:08] Yes. You made it into a word.
[03:20:09] Yeah, it's omna.
[03:20:10] One man national asset.
[03:20:12] Everybody is a national asset.
[03:20:14] This starts as like a tongue in cheek thing though, right?
[03:20:16] Like hey, that guy thinks he's a one man national asset.
[03:20:19] He's theomna.
[03:20:20] But then it becomes,
[03:20:25] on the battlefield in business and life,
[03:20:27] everyone's job is critical to a team's success.
[03:20:33] Yeah, everybody.
[03:20:33] So there you go.
[03:20:35] As far as Echo and I were also on Twitter,
[03:20:38] Twitter's hot right now.
[03:20:39] You know that?
[03:20:41] Hey, Echo Charles lost all of his Twitter followers
[03:20:44] because he got stolen.
[03:20:46] How did somebody steal that from you?
[03:20:48] Did you get fished or something?
[03:20:50] Yeah, probably clicked on something.
[03:20:52] It happened that quick, huh?
[03:20:54] Yeah, well, I didn't really go on Twitter that much,
[03:20:57] so maybe I clicked on one of these lists.
[03:21:00] What kind of lists?
[03:21:02] You know, like 10 things you should avoid
[03:21:04] when you go to, I don't know, Russia or something.
[03:21:07] I don't know.
[03:21:08] You know, they have those lists.
[03:21:09] I always click on them.
[03:21:10] Okay, so these are clickbait.
[03:21:12] You're on the internet.
[03:21:13] You're surfing the interweb.
[03:21:15] Yeah, and then it's like,
[03:21:16] Is it inside of Twitter?
[03:21:18] This is what it'll do.
[03:21:18] Here's a heads up.
[03:21:19] It'll be something along the lines of this.
[03:21:22] And it's totally my fault.
[03:21:24] Where they'll be like, oh, go back to Twitter.
[03:21:28] You know, like you'll go on the website.
[03:21:29] It'll be all messy website or whatever.
[03:21:31] I'm usually pretty good at navigating it,
[03:21:33] but then it'll be like, oh, navigate back to Twitter.
[03:21:35] So you go back.
[03:21:36] Wait, you clicked on 10 things to avoid in Russia.
[03:21:39] Yeah, I'll read it.
[03:21:40] It comes up, there's 19 pop up ads.
[03:21:43] There's a bunch of weird shit going on that thing.
[03:21:46] You maybe even got a little flag warning that came up
[03:21:48] that this is a corrupt scenario.
[03:21:49] Probably, yeah.
[03:21:50] You just ignored all that.
[03:21:51] You read the 10 things.
[03:21:52] Maybe we should do an underground podcast
[03:21:55] about the 10 things to avoid in Russia.
[03:21:57] Since we did get the knowledge we paid for.
[03:21:58] I don't know.
[03:21:59] Yeah, there's a list of some sort.
[03:22:00] So then it says, do you want to return to Twitter?
[03:22:03] Navigate back to Twitter.
[03:22:04] And then you go and then like, if I'm not mistaken,
[03:22:08] it'll say like, oh, you're like logged out
[03:22:11] or something like that.
[03:22:12] So you log back in.
[03:22:13] Oh, bro.
[03:22:17] If I remember, it was something along those lines.
[03:22:19] Russia, you, you.
[03:22:20] It'll be like confirm or I don't know, something like that.
[03:22:22] Bro, you, yeah, yeah.
[03:22:24] You messed up.
[03:22:25] Yeah, I walked right into it.
[03:22:26] And then my account is just gone.
[03:22:29] They go and then they change your username,
[03:22:30] your password, everything.
[03:22:31] So your email doesn't even show up as the account.
[03:22:35] So I'm like, whatever, it's just Twitter.
[03:22:37] And then like maybe a week or two later,
[03:22:40] people are like messaging me like,
[03:22:41] hey, someone hacked your Twitter.
[03:22:43] So I'm like, you know, whatever.
[03:22:45] And then that day with me and you,
[03:22:47] I went and looked for it.
[03:22:48] It was just gone.
[03:22:49] Everything was gone.
[03:22:50] So I just signed up under my original name.
[03:22:51] It was available.
[03:22:52] So what, how many followers did you have?
[03:22:55] Do you know how many followers did you have?
[03:22:57] Well, like, I don't know, 70 something thousand.
[03:22:59] 70,000.
[03:23:01] And now how many do you have?
[03:23:02] 70?
[03:23:03] Yeah, something like that.
[03:23:04] But you're bummed out.
[03:23:05] You're sad because the rock, then the rock follow you.
[03:23:07] No, no, no, Joe Rogan.
[03:23:08] Joe Rogan followed you on Twitter and now he's gone.
[03:23:11] Yeah, brutal, brutal.
[03:23:13] Well, you still follow me now.
[03:23:14] So that's cool.
[03:23:15] I think I was, I think I might have been your first.
[03:23:17] Oh, I was your first follower.
[03:23:18] Yeah, you were literally.
[03:23:19] There you go.
[03:23:20] Anyways, if you want to follow Echo Charles
[03:23:23] on the, on the Twitter, on the gram, on the Facebook,
[03:23:26] I'm on there too, at Echo Charles and at Jocko willing.
[03:23:29] Watch out.
[03:23:30] Watch out for the algorithm.
[03:23:31] Number one, number two, watch out for the hackers.
[03:23:34] You know, that stuff.
[03:23:36] JD, anything else?
[03:23:38] No, I'm good.
[03:23:39] Right, all man.
[03:23:40] Well, thanks for coming down.
[03:23:42] Appreciate it.
[03:23:43] More important, thanks for your service in the Marine Corps.
[03:23:46] Teaching Marines how to fight, teaching them how to lead.
[03:23:49] It's been an honor working with you past few years
[03:23:52] and I look forward to doing more in the future.
[03:23:56] Thanks to all our military and tonight,
[03:23:59] especially to our Marines.
[03:24:02] Thank you for holding the line around the world
[03:24:04] to protect and preserve our way of life.
[03:24:07] And the same goes for all our police and law enforcement,
[03:24:09] firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,
[03:24:12] correctional officers, border patrol, secret service,
[03:24:15] all first responders.
[03:24:17] We're only able to live the way we do
[03:24:20] because you live your life and sacrifice the way you do.
[03:24:24] So thank you.
[03:24:27] And everyone else out there,
[03:24:28] remember what the Marine Corps says.
[03:24:31] That while physical health and strength and well-being
[03:24:35] is important and it certainly is.
[03:24:38] It certainly is.
[03:24:40] But remember that the principal weapon is the mind.
[03:24:45] So read, study, learn and of course,
[03:24:50] keep getting after it.
[03:24:51] And until next time, this is JD and Echo and Jaco.
[03:24:55] Out.
