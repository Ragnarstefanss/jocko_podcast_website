[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 352 with me, Jocko willing.
[00:00:06] I feel certain I am going mad again.
[00:00:10] I feel we can't go through another of those terrible times.
[00:00:15] I shan't recover this time.
[00:00:17] I begin to hear voices and I can't concentrate.
[00:00:20] So I am doing what seems the best thing to do.
[00:00:25] You have given me the greatest possible happiness.
[00:00:28] You have been in every way all that anyone could be.
[00:00:34] I don't think two people could have been happier
[00:00:36] till this terrible disease came.
[00:00:40] I can't fight any longer.
[00:00:43] I know that I am spoiling your life
[00:00:45] that without me you could work.
[00:00:49] And you will, I know.
[00:00:53] You see, I can't even write this properly.
[00:00:55] I can't read.
[00:00:57] What I wanna say is that I owe all the happiness
[00:00:59] of my life to you.
[00:01:01] You've been entirely patient with me and incredibly good.
[00:01:05] I wanna say that everybody knows it.
[00:01:11] If anybody could have saved me, it would have been you.
[00:01:14] Everything has gone from me, but the certainty
[00:01:17] of your goodness.
[00:01:18] I can't go on spoiling your life any longer.
[00:01:26] And that right there is the final work
[00:01:29] of the English writer, Virginia Woolf.
[00:01:32] It was a suicide note that she left to her husband, Leonard.
[00:01:36] Virginia Woolf was born into an affluent family.
[00:01:41] She was well cared for as a child.
[00:01:43] She was homeschooled in English and Victorian literature
[00:01:47] from a young age.
[00:01:48] She attended the ladies department of Kings College
[00:01:51] in London.
[00:01:51] She was successful by any measure.
[00:01:58] And she wrote a bunch of successful novels.
[00:02:02] She authored more than 500 essays and reviews.
[00:02:06] She had friends and family
[00:02:07] and a long seemingly happy marriage.
[00:02:12] And yet throughout her life,
[00:02:14] even with all those opportunities and advantages
[00:02:17] and benefits and privilege that she had,
[00:02:19] she suffered from mental health issues.
[00:02:23] She had mood swings and depression and manic excitement
[00:02:27] and psychotic episodes.
[00:02:31] And she attempted suicide twice before she was successful
[00:02:36] in killing herself in 1941.
[00:02:39] So how does that happen?
[00:02:45] What is going on there?
[00:02:47] And psychiatrists today, they hypothesized
[00:02:50] that she had a mental health problem,
[00:02:53] in particular likely bipolar disorder,
[00:02:57] which used to be called manic depression.
[00:03:00] And we've talked about mental health on this podcast.
[00:03:03] We've talked about mental health issues facing veterans.
[00:03:06] We've covered some tragic, horrible suicides,
[00:03:14] including Chad Wilkinson,
[00:03:18] Joe Price, Charles White,
[00:03:21] Wittlesley, Lewis Polar Jr.
[00:03:25] We've also talked about non-military suicides.
[00:03:28] We talked about Iris Chang,
[00:03:31] Iris Chang, who was the author of the bestselling book,
[00:03:34] New York Times bestselling book,
[00:03:36] The Rape of Nanking.
[00:03:38] And she had a nervous breakdown in August of 2004
[00:03:42] and was placed on a wide variety of prescription medication.
[00:03:48] But over time, the medications only seemed
[00:03:50] to amplify her issues and she was diagnosed
[00:03:52] with reactive psychosis and put on even more medication.
[00:04:00] And on November 8th, 2004,
[00:04:02] she wrote, when you believe you have a future,
[00:04:06] you think in terms of generations and years,
[00:04:08] when you do not, you just live by the day,
[00:04:12] but by the minute.
[00:04:15] It's far better that you remember me as I was
[00:04:18] in my heyday as a bestselling author.
[00:04:22] Each breath is becoming difficult for me to take.
[00:04:25] The anxiety can be compared to drowning in an open sea.
[00:04:28] I know my actions, I know that my actions will transfer
[00:04:33] some of this pain to others, indeed to those
[00:04:36] who love me the most.
[00:04:39] Please forgive me.
[00:04:43] And the next day, November 9th, 2004,
[00:04:46] she killed herself with a pistol.
[00:04:51] So these are topics that we've certainly addressed.
[00:04:54] We've talked about them initially,
[00:04:56] really with Jordan Peterson.
[00:04:58] And focused on them in the most recent podcast,
[00:05:03] the last podcast we did, 251 with Marcus and Amber Capone.
[00:05:07] But it's an area that I still lack,
[00:05:12] even basic understanding of what mental health disorders
[00:05:16] are, where they come from, what we can do to prevent them
[00:05:18] or overcome them in some way.
[00:05:21] Luckily today, we have some experts from that field.
[00:05:25] Dr. Carlin Pleasance and Megan Harrison.
[00:05:29] Dr. Pleasance is a clinical psychologist
[00:05:31] who specializes in adult and adolescent psychotherapy.
[00:05:36] She's also the chief clinical advisor
[00:05:39] and a managing partner at a new treatment center
[00:05:43] in Scottsdale, Arizona.
[00:05:44] And Megan Harrison holds a master's degree
[00:05:47] in marriage and family therapy,
[00:05:50] with significant experience working with families
[00:05:52] affected by transgenerational trauma and mental illness.
[00:05:57] And Megan is the CEO and managing partner
[00:06:00] at a new treatment center in Scottsdale.
[00:06:04] So thank you both for joining us.
[00:06:09] Thanks for having us.
[00:06:10] Yes, thank you for having us.
[00:06:11] Yeah, it's great to meet you.
[00:06:13] You know, I mentioned that sort of my introduction
[00:06:15] to psychology, I would say was having
[00:06:20] Dr. Jordan Peterson on this podcast.
[00:06:21] And that's when I realized,
[00:06:25] I just didn't understand at all what was going on
[00:06:29] and what it meant to have a mental health issue.
[00:06:32] And I realized when he was on the podcast,
[00:06:35] as he was talking through some of the problems
[00:06:37] that people have, I realized that the mind,
[00:06:41] well, this is my simple caveman way of translating
[00:06:44] what he was saying, was that your mind is like a car.
[00:06:48] And sometimes the car breaks down
[00:06:50] or sometimes there's, you know, you blow a gasket
[00:06:53] or your oil is low.
[00:06:55] And when that happens, you take it into a mechanic.
[00:06:59] And the mechanic diagnosis what the problem is,
[00:07:01] oh, you blew a gasket, here's what we need to do to fix it.
[00:07:06] And so I realized that in many ways,
[00:07:10] the mind can do that too.
[00:07:11] You can blow up a gasket and there's people,
[00:07:14] psychologists or therapists,
[00:07:16] that can diagnose what the problem is
[00:07:19] and have methodologies and protocols
[00:07:22] to get those things fixed.
[00:07:27] So I, again, in my caveman brain,
[00:07:30] realized that psychologists and therapists
[00:07:35] are like mind mechanics that have seen,
[00:07:37] that's what triggered it for me,
[00:07:39] that's what triggered that thought,
[00:07:40] was he was telling me about,
[00:07:42] oh, I'd see this case, this type of case.
[00:07:44] You know, he'd see it again and he'd see it again
[00:07:46] and he'd say, again, and you develop a protocol
[00:07:47] on how to deal with it.
[00:07:48] Just like, oh, your car's making this noise,
[00:07:51] oh, okay, here's what the problem is.
[00:07:53] And you see that over and over again,
[00:07:54] you develop a protocol.
[00:07:56] So you too, welcome, and you too, are mind mechanics,
[00:08:01] as far as I can tell.
[00:08:03] Let's talk about how you guys got here,
[00:08:05] just a little bit of background
[00:08:07] just so we get familiar with you.
[00:08:08] So let's start with you.
[00:08:09] Karlyn, where'd you grow up?
[00:08:13] How'd you end up in this scenario
[00:08:14] that you're in sitting here right now?
[00:08:15] Okay, let's see, well, I grew up in the Bay Area, California.
[00:08:20] And one of the things I think is really funny
[00:08:23] about my story is I didn't understand how I got here
[00:08:27] until much, much later, looking back
[00:08:30] and trying to figure it out.
[00:08:32] For a very long time, I was one of those folks
[00:08:36] when people would say, so why did you go into psychology?
[00:08:39] Why did you become a psychologist?
[00:08:40] I would say things like, oh, I just like helping people.
[00:08:43] I'm a good listener.
[00:08:44] I'm interested in how the mind works,
[00:08:48] which are true things, but really going back
[00:08:53] and taking a more in-depth look at my journey,
[00:08:58] it started when I was a kid.
[00:09:00] I had some pretty serious physical limitations
[00:09:04] and physical illnesses that kept me out of school
[00:09:08] for a long time.
[00:09:09] I did not take a single PE class,
[00:09:12] my entire scholastic career.
[00:09:14] Didn't get to participate the same way as other kids did.
[00:09:18] Missed a lot of things, was absent a lot of the time.
[00:09:21] And I remember being really young and thinking,
[00:09:25] like, is this it?
[00:09:26] Like, is this it?
[00:09:27] Can there be some other way of being,
[00:09:32] some other way of living?
[00:09:33] Cause it was lonely.
[00:09:35] And as a kid, the sense of feeling different,
[00:09:38] like I don't really belong.
[00:09:39] How old were you when these health issues started?
[00:09:41] Was this like everything?
[00:09:42] I was diagnosed when I was two.
[00:09:44] Two with like really severe respiratory and lung problems.
[00:09:49] And back then, I mean, we're talking early 70s, right?
[00:09:52] Like treatment was not as it is now.
[00:09:54] People didn't understand.
[00:09:56] I mean, my mom talks about how I was sick as an infant,
[00:10:01] and it took two years for a doctor to say,
[00:10:04] oh, I think I know what she has.
[00:10:07] Talk about a mechanic, right?
[00:10:08] She's taken me lots of mechanics over the years.
[00:10:13] And treatments weren't as advanced as they are now.
[00:10:16] So growing up all through elementary school,
[00:10:19] junior high, high school, feeling very separate
[00:10:22] and different and not included.
[00:10:25] And knowing that people thought I was kind of weird.
[00:10:28] How come you don't come to all the things?
[00:10:30] How come you don't take PE?
[00:10:31] How come you sit in recess when we all go outside?
[00:10:34] Right, which on one hand doesn't sound,
[00:10:36] I mean, whatever, it's the plight of a kid.
[00:10:39] But when I really look back and think about it,
[00:10:41] it was that sense of feeling alone
[00:10:43] and really misunderstood and not included in things.
[00:10:50] And wondering, like there's gotta be more.
[00:10:53] Like this can't be it.
[00:10:54] This just cannot be it for me, for people.
[00:10:57] So early on, I remember thinking when I grow up,
[00:11:02] like I wanna be a doctor.
[00:11:03] I wanna be somebody who helps,
[00:11:05] basically helps people like me.
[00:11:07] Again, in a young brain thinking,
[00:11:09] well, if I feel like this,
[00:11:10] probably everybody feels like this.
[00:11:11] And I don't want people to feel like this.
[00:11:13] So maybe I'll help kids or I'll help people
[00:11:15] with respiratory problems
[00:11:18] or I'll help people with medical illnesses.
[00:11:21] And it just kind of developed that way.
[00:11:23] This idea of wanting to, I don't know,
[00:11:25] in some way help ease the suffering
[00:11:29] that other people experience
[00:11:31] and make sense of what was going on.
[00:11:35] Now again, I don't remember it like this at the time.
[00:11:38] In my mind, I just wanted to help people.
[00:11:40] So did you apply yourself at school?
[00:11:42] Were you like, I need to get straight A's
[00:11:43] so I can be a doctor?
[00:11:44] I was like, yeah.
[00:11:45] So over a two, I mean, for what I couldn't do over here,
[00:11:49] I made up for it, way over here.
[00:11:50] So lots of good grades, lots of degrees,
[00:11:53] lots of academic awards.
[00:11:55] Did you go to school with the intent of becoming a doctor?
[00:11:58] At what point did you think psychology was the place to go?
[00:12:01] For a while, I was gonna,
[00:12:02] I wanted to go into medical, medical doctor.
[00:12:04] And then when I learned that you have to take a class
[00:12:07] called anatomy and look at bodies,
[00:12:10] I thought, yeah, this might not be for me.
[00:12:13] Like you're squeamish?
[00:12:14] This is totally squeamish.
[00:12:15] So I'm like, yeah, I don't know
[00:12:16] if that's then gonna work out for me very well
[00:12:18] to go that direction.
[00:12:21] But also again, the insight of this came through hindsight
[00:12:26] is I was so curious about,
[00:12:29] really the mental part of it, right?
[00:12:31] The experience of feeling isolated and disconnected
[00:12:34] and how that left you feeling or me feeling lonely
[00:12:40] and depressed and kind of like wanting more, right?
[00:12:44] So I got a little bit more curious
[00:12:46] in the like psychological department
[00:12:48] of what happens for people who have an illness,
[00:12:50] what happens for people who feel separate
[00:12:55] and different from everybody else who are left out,
[00:12:58] who are bullied, like what happens psychologically?
[00:13:02] So I definitely made a turn along the way.
[00:13:04] And was that in college?
[00:13:06] I would say maybe high schoolish going into college.
[00:13:11] Just kind of a fascination with how the mind works.
[00:13:15] And in some ways, unlike going to a mechanic,
[00:13:21] a lot of the psychological experiences
[00:13:23] that a person might have in reaction or relation
[00:13:26] to all of these different events, you don't see them.
[00:13:29] Like, you know, we can go into a doctor
[00:13:32] and take a listen to your head and go,
[00:13:34] oh, I recognize that clicking, I know exactly what to do.
[00:13:37] There are these kind of invisible unseen experiences
[00:13:41] that make it a little bit more challenging
[00:13:44] to figure out or understand what exactly is going on.
[00:13:48] So that curiosity, I just remember high school,
[00:13:50] probably going into college, just curious,
[00:13:54] like how does this work?
[00:13:55] Like why do I feel this way?
[00:13:58] But this person I met also had an illness
[00:14:00] when she was young and she seems to be okay.
[00:14:04] Like why did I suffer?
[00:14:05] Or why was I okay over here?
[00:14:07] But this guy couldn't do grades, you know?
[00:14:10] So this kind of curiosity about how the mind influences
[00:14:15] the experiences.
[00:14:16] And I remember sitting in a,
[00:14:19] I was probably getting close to getting my first degree
[00:14:22] and in a kind of a pathology class,
[00:14:26] kind of a mental illness, a class on mental illness
[00:14:28] and the pathology of illness,
[00:14:30] the professor said, show of hands,
[00:14:32] how many in here believe that you're in here to help people?
[00:14:37] You just wanna do good in the world,
[00:14:39] the good student, me, me, along with most of the other class.
[00:14:43] And he's like, okay, how many of you in here
[00:14:45] think that you have chosen this field
[00:14:48] or chosen this part of the field
[00:14:51] because you've got your own stuff you might need to work out.
[00:14:56] And everyone's like, not me, not me, not a hand
[00:15:00] or maybe like half hand.
[00:15:03] And by the end of that class, it was the reverse.
[00:15:06] Everybody was like, yep, I've got my own stuff,
[00:15:08] I need to work out, that's partly why I'm here.
[00:15:11] All right, so that started the,
[00:15:14] I think the kind of budding awareness
[00:15:19] that this isn't just about, for me,
[00:15:21] it wasn't just about helping people
[00:15:23] and being a good listener,
[00:15:24] but it was about understanding myself
[00:15:27] and hopefully through the process,
[00:15:29] being able to take that experience and help other people,
[00:15:33] whether that's not feel so alone
[00:15:36] or understand that there are options available
[00:15:38] or that this isn't kind of the fate of your life
[00:15:43] because you have this illness or this experience.
[00:15:46] So yeah, I definitely have swung from here,
[00:15:49] like I'm just really altruistic all the way over here too.
[00:15:54] Life is hard sometimes, life is really hard.
[00:15:57] And when you factor in, like my experience growing up
[00:16:00] with an illness, also growing up in a family
[00:16:02] where there were a lot of issues
[00:16:04] and not just in my immediate family, but generational.
[00:16:07] I mean, you and I, Megan have talked about this of
[00:16:11] trauma and addiction and loss and wartime.
[00:16:15] Like you kind of inherit a little bit of that
[00:16:17] along the way.
[00:16:19] So my curiosity over time expanded
[00:16:24] beyond just my own experience,
[00:16:26] but how does this happen in families?
[00:16:28] How does this happen through generations?
[00:16:30] How do you find, we had a client we saw
[00:16:33] at the treatment center for a long time
[00:16:35] who had schizophrenia, two siblings,
[00:16:38] a sister who did not have schizophrenia,
[00:16:40] a brother who did.
[00:16:43] Parents were really, really lovely, great people,
[00:16:46] did not seem to have a lot of stuff going on,
[00:16:49] but the dad's brother, the dad had three brothers,
[00:16:52] he was one of four, all three of them had schizophrenia.
[00:16:55] So this idea, right, of like, okay, some of this
[00:16:58] is passing down through generations,
[00:17:00] not just at a genetic level,
[00:17:04] but what you're exposed to and what you're seeing
[00:17:07] and what you're experiencing and what you're witnessing.
[00:17:12] So again, for me, the curiosity and the interest
[00:17:16] was about how do these things happen?
[00:17:18] How do they go from here to here to here to here?
[00:17:22] And what can we do to shift that?
[00:17:24] So people aren't just kind of living out
[00:17:29] this emotional inheritance or this traumatic inheritance,
[00:17:33] depending on what was going on in the family.
[00:17:35] How do you break that chain?
[00:17:36] How do you do something different?
[00:17:37] How do you set your own life up to go
[00:17:41] in a different trajectory than maybe how it's been going?
[00:17:45] And then your kids and their kids and their kids.
[00:17:48] So.
[00:17:49] Yeah, it makes sense that if you were gonna get
[00:17:51] like a personal trainer, because you wanna get in shape,
[00:17:54] it would be kind of, if you saw that that personal trainer
[00:17:57] had gone through some sort of transition themselves,
[00:17:59] you go, okay, this person kind of knows what I've been through.
[00:18:02] So you kind of got that vibe,
[00:18:04] I can say vibe a lot, so you gotta forget about that.
[00:18:06] I do too, it's okay.
[00:18:08] You kind of have that vibe.
[00:18:09] So what degrees did you end up with?
[00:18:10] What did you end up with?
[00:18:12] You said you got like degree upon degree.
[00:18:14] Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:15] So I got a bachelor's degree in psychology,
[00:18:18] which unfortunately in our field nowadays,
[00:18:21] that doesn't mean a whole lot other than you went to school
[00:18:23] for a few years and learned a bunch of things
[00:18:25] about the brain.
[00:18:27] Got my master's in counseling also in California,
[00:18:31] and then got my doctorate in clinical psychology
[00:18:34] down here in San Diego.
[00:18:35] Got it.
[00:18:36] All right.
[00:18:38] Megan.
[00:18:39] Yes.
[00:18:39] Let's talk about you.
[00:18:40] Where'd you grow up?
[00:18:41] How'd you end up here?
[00:18:42] Sure, feels like a big question.
[00:18:45] I grew up in Southern Wisconsin,
[00:18:46] really small town, beautiful there.
[00:18:50] Not much to do in that area,
[00:18:51] you're probably fishing.
[00:18:53] Where'd your parents go?
[00:18:55] My dad owned a chain of grocery stores,
[00:18:59] and my mom worked just cleaning houses
[00:19:03] and working for my uncle's scrap metal business,
[00:19:06] whatever we could do.
[00:19:08] And my dad that I'm speaking to came later on in life
[00:19:10] as well with like the chain of grocery stores.
[00:19:12] So the first part of my life was just me and mom.
[00:19:15] And so she taught me definitely hard work,
[00:19:17] but there wasn't much to do where I grew up.
[00:19:19] You were bowling, curling, fishing, hunting,
[00:19:24] or going to the bar.
[00:19:24] That was about it.
[00:19:27] Curling.
[00:19:28] Curling just made the podcast.
[00:19:29] We're 352 podcasts deep, and we just got into curling.
[00:19:33] It's a big deal in Wisconsin, let me tell you.
[00:19:35] It's very cold for about eight months out of the year.
[00:19:38] So, yeah.
[00:19:40] I mean, my story, I was born into a family system
[00:19:44] that had definitely been impacted
[00:19:46] by just generations of trauma,
[00:19:49] abuse, addiction, mental health issues
[00:19:52] on the very severe end.
[00:19:54] And similar to what Karlin is saying,
[00:19:58] I don't know that like sitting here right now,
[00:20:00] like the only intentionality in that for me
[00:20:02] in coming into this therapy world was just this idea
[00:20:04] that through life, every step I took forward
[00:20:08] in terms of overcoming just brought me further
[00:20:12] into the life that I envisioned for myself.
[00:20:14] And that was sort of my intention in that way.
[00:20:16] But I knew growing up in that environment
[00:20:18] that there was no way I was gonna be able
[00:20:20] to do something different for myself
[00:20:23] or do something different for the family
[00:20:24] I wanted to have if I stayed there.
[00:20:26] And so from a very young age,
[00:20:27] I sort of started my path towards independence.
[00:20:30] I started working at a very young age.
[00:20:33] The military sort of came into my life as this idea
[00:20:36] like here's an opportunity to go somewhere,
[00:20:39] to do something.
[00:20:40] I actually was finishing some high school stuff
[00:20:43] at a community college and was watching
[00:20:48] the September 11th occurrences in 2001.
[00:20:51] And I just remember looking at the screen and being like,
[00:20:55] oh, this is what I'm gonna do.
[00:20:57] I had entertained the military for a period of time.
[00:20:59] And I had thought maybe this was my opportunity,
[00:21:01] but it was in that moment that I was like, okay,
[00:21:03] like this, I feel a sense of purpose,
[00:21:04] like drawn to something.
[00:21:05] And in the environment that I grew up in,
[00:21:06] I kind of always knew that I wanted something different
[00:21:10] for myself, but I lacked a lot of direction
[00:21:12] and people in my life to kind of help me guide
[00:21:14] in that way, education wasn't particularly valued
[00:21:17] or seen as like a possibility.
[00:21:19] And at that point in my life,
[00:21:20] I hadn't had enough experiences
[00:21:22] other than just like surviving in a lot of ways
[00:21:25] to see that as possible for myself,
[00:21:29] to see ready to like go to school and do that route.
[00:21:31] And so the military just felt like, like, okay,
[00:21:33] this is what I'm gonna go do.
[00:21:35] And there's like something really important
[00:21:36] that's happening, I need to go do it.
[00:21:37] And it was about a year later, August of 2002
[00:21:40] that I was on active duty and...
[00:21:42] And what'd you join?
[00:21:44] I joined the Navy.
[00:21:45] How'd you pick that?
[00:21:46] Being a Wisconsin.
[00:21:47] You know, it's really interesting.
[00:21:48] I think it was, it had to do with the recruiter at the time
[00:21:51] because I was definitely a youth that was getting,
[00:21:55] you know, some help from the community
[00:21:57] and different things.
[00:21:57] And at that time in the Midwest,
[00:21:58] you know, recruiters would come into those areas
[00:22:00] and introduce themselves and such.
[00:22:01] And so I just remember him as being somebody
[00:22:04] that I was like, okay, like he seems confident.
[00:22:07] Like, he carries himself,
[00:22:09] like this is like something I wanna be a part of.
[00:22:13] And it sort of seems cliche,
[00:22:14] but at the time it was everything for me
[00:22:16] because I didn't, you know, the friends that I had
[00:22:17] at the time and I had, you know, been living with friends
[00:22:20] at a very young age and such,
[00:22:21] like we weren't really going to a lot of places,
[00:22:23] jail, I lost a lot of friends to, you know, death,
[00:22:26] you know, suicide, overdoses.
[00:22:27] There was just a lot of that in my life.
[00:22:30] And so just being around somebody who just sort of
[00:22:35] represented like a possibly different future
[00:22:38] and like life was huge for me.
[00:22:39] It was like a role model mentor.
[00:22:42] And so I joined.
[00:22:45] What job did you sign up for?
[00:22:46] So I came in as a signalman.
[00:22:49] And that's what I went to A-School for,
[00:22:50] but I dates myself a little bit
[00:22:51] because it's already kind of like a dying rate at the time.
[00:22:54] So I went to A-School to be a signalman.
[00:22:55] And my first orders were actually to the USS Kitty Hawk
[00:22:59] and in Japan at the time.
[00:23:01] And I was like set to leave about a week later
[00:23:05] and my orders got canceled
[00:23:06] because there wasn't enough birthing for females at the time.
[00:23:08] And I was rerouted to ACB One in San Diego.
[00:23:11] And I got there and I was getting issued camis and boots
[00:23:16] and like we were getting ready to deploy to Kuwait
[00:23:18] because this was like August of,
[00:23:19] or this was like latter part of 2002.
[00:23:22] So we were like getting ready to go overseas
[00:23:25] for everything that was happening during operation
[00:23:26] and during freedom and during that time.
[00:23:28] And so I was like, what did I just get myself into?
[00:23:32] Because I thought I was going to a ship
[00:23:34] and then here I am in like a whole different world
[00:23:36] as I'm sure you're familiar.
[00:23:37] The CVs are just a whole different realm and such.
[00:23:39] And so, but it was such a blessing for me
[00:23:43] because it was like a form of reparenting
[00:23:46] like the amount of structure that I went into.
[00:23:48] I knew exactly what was expected of me.
[00:23:50] And it was also the first time that I learned how much
[00:23:53] I think because of the environment I grew up in
[00:23:55] that I thrive in crisis in some ways.
[00:23:59] Like things get crazy, something's happening.
[00:24:02] Everything for me just kind of calms down.
[00:24:04] And I wanted to lead and I found myself
[00:24:08] in a lot of leadership positions.
[00:24:09] I found myself an opportunity like volunteer for this,
[00:24:11] volunteer for that, I'll do it.
[00:24:13] And it really gave me the opportunity to just build
[00:24:16] a sense of self for the first time.
[00:24:18] The community, the feedback that I was getting
[00:24:21] was just huge for me.
[00:24:22] And then all kinds of doors opened up for me.
[00:24:24] The idea of like, I could go to school, I could do this.
[00:24:28] My first interest in doing some counseling such
[00:24:31] actually came from, I thought originally
[00:24:32] I was gonna go to school to do organizational psychology
[00:24:36] for leadership, like that was really my goal.
[00:24:38] I always wanted to be a leader for me.
[00:24:40] Just before you joined the Navy or once you got in?
[00:24:42] Once I got in, you know, and I was just kind of drawn
[00:24:45] into these situations where I knew that there was like,
[00:24:48] I don't know if you wanna call it a natural leadership
[00:24:50] quality, but there was just like this part of me
[00:24:52] that I had gone through so much and I had overcome so much
[00:24:55] that it was like people need that, you know,
[00:24:58] to like hear that story, to be a part of that.
[00:25:00] Like it just, it was a really powerful thing for me.
[00:25:05] And I was realizing for other people as well at the time.
[00:25:07] And so I got offered an opportunity to do some work
[00:25:11] with families in pre and post deployment sort of support.
[00:25:16] And it was very logistical at the time,
[00:25:18] how do you support families and like, you know,
[00:25:21] preparing for the logistics of bills or separation
[00:25:24] or what's going on.
[00:25:25] But what I realized at that time was that there was a
[00:25:28] significant amount of support that these families needed
[00:25:32] and understand like how much role shifts were happening
[00:25:35] when one of the partners would deploy and then I'm making
[00:25:38] this new group of friends while my husband or my wife
[00:25:41] is gone and they're making their new group of friends.
[00:25:43] And our kids are getting used to me as playing like both
[00:25:46] mom and dad and doing these different roles.
[00:25:48] And they just did not have the resources to be able
[00:25:51] to deal with that.
[00:25:52] And I think because I had gone through what I did as a child,
[00:25:55] I could recognize things related to like mental health
[00:25:58] or relationship issues or things like that.
[00:26:01] I didn't really have the skill set yet to know exactly
[00:26:03] what to do with that other than just my mindset was always
[00:26:06] like, you just do keep moving forward.
[00:26:09] And one step at a time and you make healthy decisions
[00:26:12] and you recognize that, you know, I don't exist in a vacuum
[00:26:14] and the things that I do matter and how I treat people matter.
[00:26:17] And I could support people a lot with that,
[00:26:19] but it was, that was what first drew me to the idea
[00:26:23] of counseling.
[00:26:24] And at the time I was working,
[00:26:28] when I decided to go to school for counseling,
[00:26:30] I was working as a contractor for HSC three.
[00:26:32] So this was after.
[00:26:33] So how long did you end up doing in the Navy?
[00:26:34] So I did five years.
[00:26:35] I did four years on active duty and then I extended
[00:26:37] for a year.
[00:26:38] How was that first deployment to Kuwait?
[00:26:40] It was intense.
[00:26:44] You know, we were at the Kuwaiti Naval Base.
[00:26:46] We came in during a time where really nothing was set up.
[00:26:49] Our goal is that being the CBs there,
[00:26:51] ACB one and ACB two were there at the same time.
[00:26:53] So when we got there, we knew we're not leaving for a while.
[00:26:56] Cops and CBs, by the way, CBs are awesome.
[00:26:58] Yes, they definitely are.
[00:27:00] And I definitely make friends with builders
[00:27:02] because your camp will be real nice.
[00:27:04] You'll get a nice little shelf up there
[00:27:06] and all the things that you need.
[00:27:07] And they'll steal you whatever you need.
[00:27:09] Which no one wants to talk about.
[00:27:12] I learned how to be very resourceful.
[00:27:15] There was also some aspects of being in the military
[00:27:17] as a female in that type of environment
[00:27:19] and a lot of things that were going on during that time
[00:27:21] that made it a scary situation sometimes too.
[00:27:23] You want to feel safe in that environment.
[00:27:25] But there was, you know, you're in the middle of the desert
[00:27:28] and people are going through wartime.
[00:27:30] And we had incoming missiles coming in.
[00:27:32] We're running to Connick's bosses that
[00:27:34] are buried in the ground for shelter.
[00:27:35] Like people were on edge during that time, for sure.
[00:27:41] But I learned a lot.
[00:27:43] And if anything, it was walking away from that knowing
[00:27:45] that I could, you know, it doesn't matter what life
[00:27:49] throws at you.
[00:27:50] If you just keep moving forward, you'll get through it,
[00:27:53] for sure.
[00:27:54] So if I can interrupt, I remember you telling a story
[00:27:57] one time, Megan, about having to dig holes
[00:28:01] to sleep in the ground and having your gun there
[00:28:05] because of how big the scorpions were.
[00:28:08] And having to protect yourself and guard yourself
[00:28:10] from the scorpions while you're in a hole in the desert
[00:28:13] at 127 degrees and you're like 19.
[00:28:18] Yeah, I think you can pretty much
[00:28:19] handle whatever is going to come your way in life.
[00:28:23] But I mean, this is sort of where you're talking about earlier,
[00:28:26] where one person can have one situation growing up
[00:28:28] and another can have an entirely different situation.
[00:28:30] And how you choose to respond is going to very much
[00:28:33] so shape the outcome of who you are.
[00:28:35] And so for me, I just, you know, there
[00:28:37] was a lot of opportunity to move into fear
[00:28:39] and have fear make you small.
[00:28:40] And for me, it was just like, I'm just going to keep going.
[00:28:42] But there wasn't, at that time in my life, I can't say,
[00:28:45] I mean, I was very young that I was intentionally, like,
[00:28:47] this is what I'm doing to overcome.
[00:28:49] Or that really wasn't there for me.
[00:28:50] It just like stopping or not moving or going backwards
[00:28:53] wasn't an option.
[00:28:54] Just keep moving forward with whatever kind of presented
[00:28:57] itself to me.
[00:28:58] So yeah, I was there for a year and actually didn't find out
[00:29:01] till the day before we were leaving that I was leaving.
[00:29:03] So it was like, you know, coming up to you like,
[00:29:05] here's your plane ticket, you're leaving tomorrow.
[00:29:07] I'm like, cool.
[00:29:08] And at the time, you know, cell phones weren't allowed.
[00:29:10] We couldn't have any of that.
[00:29:12] And so there was two phones in the camp for a camp of, gosh,
[00:29:16] don't quote me on this.
[00:29:17] But there was a lot of people.
[00:29:18] The army was there.
[00:29:19] I won't quote you on a lot of people being super specific
[00:29:22] like that.
[00:29:23] The, you know, special operations, special forces
[00:29:26] were there.
[00:29:27] The Air Force was there.
[00:29:28] We had Australian, British, you know,
[00:29:31] military was a huge camp, Kuwaiti Naval Base.
[00:29:33] And so two phones for a large group of people
[00:29:38] would make the line very long that you're
[00:29:40] waiting, you could be standing there in hours.
[00:29:41] And then there'd be an incoming missile.
[00:29:43] Everybody'd have to run, go take, you know, shelter.
[00:29:46] And then I gave up.
[00:29:48] So I didn't make any phones.
[00:29:50] And also for me, like, I, you know, I was, I was moving
[00:29:53] forward and didn't have a whole lot of connections to the past.
[00:29:55] So I was just, yeah.
[00:29:58] So you get done with your Navy career.
[00:30:00] You end up as a contractor.
[00:30:01] And this is, so when did you end up like going to school?
[00:30:06] So that was when I was a, when I was a contractor, I started.
[00:30:08] So I started with my, I actually went to school to be a pharmacy
[00:30:10] tech while I was still on active duty.
[00:30:12] I was, you know, single mom at the time and just raising my son
[00:30:16] and going to school at night and working during the day.
[00:30:18] And pharmacy tech seemed like a good option for me at the time
[00:30:21] to have a job when I got out.
[00:30:22] So I finished that before I got out.
[00:30:24] I started working at a compounding pharmacy.
[00:30:27] I very quickly realized this is not what I want to do.
[00:30:31] Went back to school for my bachelor's in psychology
[00:30:34] and then started working towards my master's
[00:30:37] in that contractor work.
[00:30:38] So my bachelor's and my master's all came after I had separated
[00:30:42] from the military.
[00:30:43] So, and so yeah, I obtained my master's while I was working
[00:30:47] as a contractor and was introduced for my practicum.
[00:30:50] So in counseling psychology, you have to do some pre-degree
[00:30:54] and post-degree hours, about a total of 3,000 direct,
[00:30:57] like direct and indirect clinical hours in order
[00:31:00] to obtain your degree.
[00:31:00] And so you get introduced to various treatment centers
[00:31:03] while you're in your school to, you know,
[00:31:07] get that experience and practice.
[00:31:08] And that was when I was actually introduced to Humblechia,
[00:31:10] which was owned by Kerry and Carlin at the time.
[00:31:12] So treatment center for clients
[00:31:14] with complex psychiatric disorders.
[00:31:16] And again, for me at the time, I was like,
[00:31:18] this is just sounds so interesting, family therapy
[00:31:21] and all of that.
[00:31:22] In my mind, I was going to school
[00:31:23] because this was the school that I could do at night
[00:31:26] while I was commuting.
[00:31:27] I was commuting from Temecula down to Naval Air Station
[00:31:30] at the time.
[00:31:31] It was like 72 miles one way.
[00:31:32] And so I was just kind of moving through life, like,
[00:31:35] you know, just doing the things that I thought
[00:31:36] I needed to do to move forward.
[00:31:39] And then I met Kerry and Carlin
[00:31:41] and I came to know Humblechia.
[00:31:43] And Humblechia was just this really special place.
[00:31:48] It was like, I like to call it like a,
[00:31:51] I'm very much all about like small business ownership
[00:31:53] and like what that means for our economy and such.
[00:31:56] But Kerry and Carlin just, they just owned this treatment
[00:31:58] center and it was not, it was just a small family owned place
[00:32:03] where like people just 100% threw themselves
[00:32:06] into helping these families.
[00:32:08] And I was drawn to it so much because the families
[00:32:11] that were walking through there were definitely
[00:32:12] the types of family, like could have been my family, right?
[00:32:15] And here I was in this place where really beautiful things
[00:32:19] were happening in terms of supporting these people
[00:32:21] suffering through very severe things.
[00:32:23] I mean, when you have a loved one who has a chronic,
[00:32:25] complex psychiatric disorder,
[00:32:27] something that you're not getting rid of, right?
[00:32:28] We're like making friends with this.
[00:32:30] We're learning how to, how to, how to,
[00:32:32] how to, you know, accept it, grieve what I thought
[00:32:38] was gonna be for my kiddo, you know, whatever it may be.
[00:32:41] When a family lets you into their life to like walk
[00:32:43] through that path of them is a very special thing.
[00:32:46] And I knew at that point like, okay,
[00:32:49] this is what I wanna do.
[00:32:49] I wanna work with families.
[00:32:51] And when I started to realize not only in my own life,
[00:32:55] but in what we were doing that we were creating
[00:32:58] like generational change, like when you can help
[00:33:00] a family system shift away from abuse or addiction
[00:33:05] or grief or in a way that allows them to envision
[00:33:11] a different identity for themselves.
[00:33:13] Like life could be different.
[00:33:14] Like we don't actually have to keep going in this way
[00:33:17] or continue these patterns.
[00:33:19] I mean, you think about the impact of that
[00:33:21] for years and years to come.
[00:33:23] We're talking about hundreds of people
[00:33:25] that could be impacted by one person choosing
[00:33:27] to do something different.
[00:33:29] That was like everything to me.
[00:33:30] And that's what I knew I wanted to do.
[00:33:32] And it's what I realized I was able to do for my family
[00:33:35] in a lot of ways.
[00:33:37] And then this sort of became my family when I was there.
[00:33:41] Like just, I was able to be seen in a different way.
[00:33:44] It was like, oh, we have this new leadership opportunity.
[00:33:46] Like you do it.
[00:33:47] And I'm like, me?
[00:33:49] And this is an interesting,
[00:33:53] this is the kind of the intersection between me and you two,
[00:33:56] which is, you know, I got a group of friends
[00:33:58] and we invest in a bunch of different things.
[00:34:01] And at one point, you know, my buddy Joe said,
[00:34:06] hey, we're gonna invest in this.
[00:34:07] We're gonna buy some real estate.
[00:34:09] And it's gonna be used by this mental health facility.
[00:34:11] And I was like, you know, cool.
[00:34:12] I mean, literally with them,
[00:34:13] they just kind of tell me what,
[00:34:15] like they tell me a three minute,
[00:34:17] hey, this is what we're putting money into.
[00:34:18] I say, cool, give them some money.
[00:34:20] We throw it in there.
[00:34:21] And at some point we invested in sort of a branch
[00:34:24] of Hamletchia and then that branch got swept
[00:34:29] into Hamletchia and the whole thing got bought.
[00:34:31] And so, you know, we,
[00:34:33] it was a cool situation for us.
[00:34:35] You know, we made money and high-fived.
[00:34:37] And then that eventually rolled into this new venture,
[00:34:41] which is the new treatment center, which again,
[00:34:44] I mean, I'm just basically like,
[00:34:47] I don't wanna say a gambler,
[00:34:48] but a little bit of a gambler.
[00:34:49] Like you're just letting money roll, you know,
[00:34:50] like, oh, just leave it on the table.
[00:34:52] And that's kind of what I did.
[00:34:53] The next thing, you know, I'm invested in this,
[00:34:55] in this new treatment center
[00:34:56] and that's all starting to take place.
[00:34:58] And so that's kind of how we all know each other
[00:35:02] was from that connection, you know,
[00:35:05] from me just kind of letting my money sit on the table
[00:35:07] and hope it keeps doing well.
[00:35:10] That's how we all know each other.
[00:35:13] But look, so thank you for your backgrounds.
[00:35:17] Definitely, I'm sure we could do a whole podcast
[00:35:19] about like each one of your stories
[00:35:21] because there's a lot there.
[00:35:23] But I wanna kind of get to the topic at hand, right?
[00:35:27] Which is me trying to get a better understanding
[00:35:29] of mental health issues.
[00:35:31] And, you know, we were talking about before hit record
[00:35:34] that just different things can hit people so differently.
[00:35:38] And two people can experience the same,
[00:35:40] literally the same traumatic event
[00:35:43] and have totally different reactions.
[00:35:46] As you were talking, Megan, I was thinking that
[00:35:50] like in SEAL training,
[00:35:51] the people that make it through SEAL training
[00:35:53] are so radically different.
[00:35:55] You've got a kid that grew up with a silver spoon
[00:35:57] in his mouth and he makes it through no problem.
[00:35:58] You got another kid that makes it,
[00:35:59] the silver spoon in his mouth and he quits the first day.
[00:36:01] You got someone that grew up on a farm in Iowa
[00:36:04] and he makes it through no problem.
[00:36:05] Someone else that grew up on a farm in Iowa
[00:36:07] and they quit the first day.
[00:36:08] And everyone in between,
[00:36:09] you got a kid from the ghetto that, you know,
[00:36:11] didn't have anything and he just makes it through.
[00:36:14] Some other kid from the ghetto first day,
[00:36:15] I'm not putting up with this shit.
[00:36:16] And that's, so these different lives
[00:36:20] can have just a radically different outcome.
[00:36:23] What are some of the main causes
[00:36:26] of mental health issues?
[00:36:28] Like what is, and I know there must be several factors.
[00:36:32] I mean, there must be some that are hereditary.
[00:36:34] You kind of mentioned that, Karlyn,
[00:36:36] like there are some hereditary things
[00:36:37] and there must be some things that are brought on
[00:36:39] by the environment that you grow up in or what you see.
[00:36:42] So what are some of the kind of main causes?
[00:36:47] Well, there's, gosh, there's so many.
[00:36:49] It's hard to narrow them down.
[00:36:51] And like I was saying earlier,
[00:36:53] so many of these things are unseen.
[00:36:55] They're invisible.
[00:36:56] They can't be like located so much on a map, so to speak.
[00:37:00] But things like temperament, you know,
[00:37:02] like the kind of the traits and characteristics
[00:37:04] that we're born with are gonna play a role.
[00:37:08] Our upbringing, of course.
[00:37:10] Like I'm thinking when you would share that story
[00:37:11] about being in Kuwait and I'm like,
[00:37:14] I, first of all, I would have never made it there.
[00:37:17] But like, I don't think I could have done that.
[00:37:20] Now, is it, do I not have a tenacious personality
[00:37:24] or perseverance?
[00:37:25] No, I've got some of that.
[00:37:25] But I think about my early upbringing, right?
[00:37:28] Where just living was hard.
[00:37:31] Digging a hole to like survive.
[00:37:32] That would have been at this whole other level for me.
[00:37:34] So my history, so people's histories, messages,
[00:37:40] like in the family, like that's a,
[00:37:42] and this is my opinion.
[00:37:43] What's a message, for example?
[00:37:44] Like for example, I like to ask families
[00:37:48] or family members sometimes.
[00:37:50] So how did you guys do feelings?
[00:37:53] Hmm.
[00:37:54] What were feelings like?
[00:37:58] Most of the time you're gonna have folks say,
[00:38:00] oh, we don't talk about feelings.
[00:38:03] We don't actually do feelings.
[00:38:06] Oh, okay, so when something difficult happens,
[00:38:10] you know, you get bullied at school,
[00:38:12] your boyfriend breaks up with you,
[00:38:16] grandma passes away.
[00:38:17] What did you guys do?
[00:38:20] Oh, nothing, we just had dinner.
[00:38:23] Like, you know, right?
[00:38:23] So right here, right, there's something.
[00:38:26] A family that didn't acknowledge feelings,
[00:38:28] talk about feelings, have a way to process
[00:38:32] what was happening is going to have a certain effect
[00:38:35] versus the family you ask.
[00:38:37] And they're like, oh, we talked about feelings all the time.
[00:38:38] Anytime something happened,
[00:38:39] we sit down and have a big family meeting about it.
[00:38:42] That person is gonna be shaped very differently
[00:38:45] in terms of managing stress and managing conflict
[00:38:50] and negotiating hardship, right?
[00:38:53] So family messages and family,
[00:38:57] almost like traditions around things like feelings
[00:39:02] or how you handle hardship.
[00:39:04] I mean, the book I'm writing right now has a lot to do
[00:39:07] with the impact of secrets.
[00:39:09] So, and finding that that has a big impact.
[00:39:13] Well, I just see it gets in the family.
[00:39:15] Secrets like, yeah, like we don't talk.
[00:39:17] Like if something happens,
[00:39:20] we're just not gonna talk about that.
[00:39:21] We're not gonna talk about it amongst ourselves.
[00:39:23] We're not gonna share this with the outside world,
[00:39:26] under the rug, in the vault, whatever you wanna call it.
[00:39:29] So you think about, again,
[00:39:31] it's not gonna affect everybody the same way,
[00:39:33] but how easy it would be for a person then to develop,
[00:39:37] especially if they're young,
[00:39:39] this idea that like, oh, when bad things happen
[00:39:42] or when difficult things happen,
[00:39:43] you're not supposed to talk about that.
[00:39:45] You're supposed to keep it to yourself.
[00:39:47] Don't share.
[00:39:49] So what happens for those folks
[00:39:51] who are faced with something difficult
[00:39:52] or faced with a hard decision
[00:39:53] or faced with a stressful circumstance?
[00:39:58] And then it's also so individual
[00:40:01] because someone can say, oh, my grandma died
[00:40:06] and I'm looking at my dad and he looks stoic.
[00:40:09] That seems like a good thing to do.
[00:40:10] That seems like a good example, right?
[00:40:12] Or, oh, my grandma died and my dad looks stoic.
[00:40:16] He doesn't care.
[00:40:18] And so it's like your interpretation,
[00:40:21] people's individual interpretation.
[00:40:23] And even when you were talking, Megan,
[00:40:24] like when you joined the military
[00:40:26] or even you saw this recruiter
[00:40:28] and you kind of say, oh, this guy looks put together.
[00:40:31] And you get the military and you're like, okay,
[00:40:32] here's what I should be doing.
[00:40:34] And like your perception of what you're seeing
[00:40:38] and then your decision to say, oh, I can step up.
[00:40:41] I can volunteer for this.
[00:40:43] I can make this happen.
[00:40:44] Like just people's own interaction with reality
[00:40:49] and what's going on is so different.
[00:40:52] And is there a way that you can take people
[00:40:56] and show them the positive one?
[00:40:57] Does that work?
[00:40:58] Is that a thing to do?
[00:41:00] Like let me give you an example.
[00:41:01] I have a kids podcast that I do sometimes
[00:41:05] and I'll answer kids questions.
[00:41:06] I've written a bunch of kids books.
[00:41:08] And one of the questions I got one time was from a kid
[00:41:10] and I've got multiple forms of this question is,
[00:41:13] and this actually reminds me of you, Karlyn.
[00:41:15] The question was like, oh,
[00:41:19] sometimes kids don't like to hang out with me
[00:41:21] and I feel like I'm alone.
[00:41:25] How can I feel better about that?
[00:41:28] And I answered the question like, hey,
[00:41:30] it's okay to be alone.
[00:41:32] I'm alone sometimes and it's okay.
[00:41:33] Sometimes you're gonna be alone
[00:41:34] and you don't always have to have people around you
[00:41:35] and it doesn't mean they don't like you.
[00:41:37] It doesn't mean you're not gonna have friends.
[00:41:38] It's just that sometimes you're alone and that's okay.
[00:41:41] And I mean, that's to me is a legitimate answer
[00:41:45] because let's say your mom says, why are you alone again?
[00:41:50] Why don't you have any friends?
[00:41:51] That might start to mess you up.
[00:41:54] As opposed to mom saying, oh, what are you reading?
[00:41:57] Oh, here's a book.
[00:41:58] So how we're interacting and how things,
[00:42:02] how you perceive the world can be so different
[00:42:05] that these things, and again, you got a kid
[00:42:07] that grew up in Iowa that quits
[00:42:09] and you got a kid that grew up in Iowa on a farm.
[00:42:11] They both grew up in the same exact thing.
[00:42:12] One of them quits, one of them makes it.
[00:42:15] So do you as therapists, as psychologists,
[00:42:18] get to try and guide and open and show those positive things?
[00:42:21] Is that what we're doing here?
[00:42:23] Well, I think we're trying to create
[00:42:25] some reparative experiences
[00:42:27] because when you talk about the story of the guy who quit
[00:42:29] or the guy who went, I would be really curious
[00:42:31] about his history and past around what happened
[00:42:34] when he was struggling, when he was having a hard time
[00:42:36] or needed to move through something
[00:42:38] or didn't know if he could move forward.
[00:42:40] What was the response or message
[00:42:41] that he received in his environment?
[00:42:42] And the thing about some of these aspects of mental health
[00:42:45] that are very complex, hard to pinpoint
[00:42:47] exactly what needs to be,
[00:42:49] but the story that you just told about this child,
[00:42:51] that response, when someone chooses to lean in
[00:42:54] and be vulnerable in a way and ask a question
[00:42:56] or look out for support,
[00:42:57] how we respond to them is pivotal
[00:43:00] because it shapes their experience
[00:43:02] of whether or not that's a safe thing to do again
[00:43:04] in the future.
[00:43:05] So we talk about what cultures
[00:43:07] or what things influence why someone might keep things
[00:43:10] to themselves or be less inclined to share
[00:43:12] or come forward if they're struggling with something
[00:43:15] is how we respond is huge.
[00:43:17] And so there's so much aspects of what's going on
[00:43:20] for another person that we don't actually have control over.
[00:43:23] But what we do have control over
[00:43:24] is sort of our own reaction to
[00:43:26] when someone is sharing something with us
[00:43:28] that appears upsetting,
[00:43:30] do we wanna shut it down
[00:43:32] and kind of they should be fine and get moved past it
[00:43:35] because that creates an experience for them
[00:43:36] or can we kind of tolerate
[00:43:38] whatever feelings are coming up for us
[00:43:39] when we see someone who's struggling
[00:43:41] or with working through something
[00:43:42] that I have no idea how to fix or how to respond to,
[00:43:45] but can I sit with them for enough time
[00:43:47] to create an experience for them
[00:43:49] that lets them know that like,
[00:43:52] if something's coming up for me again
[00:43:54] or if I need to work through this,
[00:43:55] it's safe to come to this person
[00:43:56] or this environment is safe enough
[00:43:58] to be able to share what's going on for me
[00:44:01] because if it's not and that person goes inside,
[00:44:03] then when we look at more severe things like suicide
[00:44:06] or very chronic psychiatric disorders,
[00:44:09] that becomes much more debilitating
[00:44:12] in a way that can cause someone their life.
[00:44:17] I think what you said, I also, I so appreciate what you said.
[00:44:20] Did I give a good answer?
[00:44:21] You did, that was really good.
[00:44:22] Very lucky.
[00:44:24] Of how you responded to the kid, right?
[00:44:27] To me, I'm like, there it is.
[00:44:28] Perfect.
[00:44:29] As opposed to say a mom or somebody else
[00:44:31] that would be like, well, come on, what are you doing wrong?
[00:44:33] How come you don't have any friends?
[00:44:35] Versus like, oh, I'm sorry to hear that bud,
[00:44:37] but you know what, it's okay.
[00:44:39] It's okay sometimes to be alone.
[00:44:40] I'm sorry that you're feeling bad about that today,
[00:44:42] but okay, it's all right.
[00:44:44] There's something about the,
[00:44:47] like I'm just acknowledging what you're going through.
[00:44:49] I'm not trying to change it, I'm not making it wrong,
[00:44:51] I'm not telling you you should be doing something different.
[00:44:54] And that brings out that safety piece.
[00:44:56] And in fact, some research into resiliency.
[00:44:59] So speaking to how come some kids kind of bounce back
[00:45:03] and get better and some kids really flounder over here.
[00:45:08] Some of the research shows that there needs to be opportunities
[00:45:12] to make mistakes and like not be essentially shamed
[00:45:16] or made in trouble, opportunity to fix them,
[00:45:21] which means you gotta use new skills
[00:45:23] and like try and experiment and trial and error.
[00:45:25] And you need to have at least one adult.
[00:45:30] If you got more, that's even better,
[00:45:31] but you need to have one adult that is kind of a safe guide.
[00:45:37] Like somebody that you can feel safe with
[00:45:40] that's gonna kind of get ya and say, you know what, buddy,
[00:45:42] it's all right, sorry, that one did not work out so well,
[00:45:44] we'll try it again tomorrow.
[00:45:46] Versus the shaming, you're wrong, how come you did that?
[00:45:51] You should know better, like those kind of things.
[00:45:53] So resiliency is about having adults, especially as kids,
[00:45:56] having adults that can say, yep, you know what,
[00:45:59] sometimes it's just like that, I'm sorry, but it's okay,
[00:46:02] you'll be fine.
[00:46:05] I had another guy who's a neuroscientist named
[00:46:08] Andrew Huberman on here and we were talking about
[00:46:11] like winning and losing his kids.
[00:46:12] And he said, it's through your whole life,
[00:46:15] you gotta push yourself, you gotta lose sometimes.
[00:46:18] And he actually gave the percentage and he's got research
[00:46:20] or whatever, he's a stamp for doctor,
[00:46:22] so I guess he's smarter, whatever, Andrew.
[00:46:25] But we came down, it's like 80% of the time,
[00:46:28] you want the kid to kind of do well,
[00:46:30] and then 20% of the time, they should like lose.
[00:46:32] If they start, what I did with my kids
[00:46:35] was lose 90% of the time, like put them
[00:46:38] in really hard situations and that's not the good way
[00:46:41] to do it.
[00:46:41] Luckily, my kids turned out pretty resilient.
[00:46:44] But I was just like, oh, you're gonna get beat down,
[00:46:47] it's gonna make you tougher, it's gonna make you stronger.
[00:46:49] And no, what happens is they just start
[00:46:52] to feel like a loser, right?
[00:46:53] So you gotta be careful with that, but that 80%,
[00:46:55] I think it's a good number to, okay, 80% of the time,
[00:46:58] you're winning or you're evenly matched,
[00:47:00] but you're doing well, 20% of the time,
[00:47:02] you gotta be pushing yourself into some situations.
[00:47:04] And that's the weird thing, like the seal training,
[00:47:06] like I'm talking about kids that were Division I wrestlers,
[00:47:10] right, quit.
[00:47:12] Division I wrestling is so insanely hard.
[00:47:16] And they have all kinds of hypothesis, you know,
[00:47:19] somebody that was a really good athlete,
[00:47:21] they've never really been, they've never lost.
[00:47:23] And when you get the seal training, you're gonna lose.
[00:47:25] Like you're gonna fail stuff.
[00:47:27] And so that can be a problem with people's mentality
[00:47:31] because they've just never lost before.
[00:47:32] And then there's some kid that's been getting beat down
[00:47:35] this whole life, he's like, oh, cool, I failed, whatever,
[00:47:37] I'm gonna keep going.
[00:47:38] So how do you diagnose, you know, again,
[00:47:44] I made the car mechanic thing.
[00:47:45] And the cool thing, the interesting thing about this metaphor
[00:47:49] is even a car mechanic, you bring a car
[00:47:50] and there's a whatever, a tapping noise in the engine.
[00:47:54] He doesn't necessarily know 100%, what is it?
[00:47:57] He's like, ah, it could be this, could be that.
[00:47:58] He's gotta dig in there.
[00:47:59] So is that the way diagnosis works?
[00:48:03] You're sort of like, okay, here's a problem,
[00:48:07] you're getting super emotional.
[00:48:09] We don't know what's causing it yet,
[00:48:11] that's the tapping, right?
[00:48:12] You're getting super emotional.
[00:48:13] And then what are we doing to diagnose?
[00:48:14] How does it happen?
[00:48:18] Pretty much, I mean, it is a, let's look over here.
[00:48:23] Oh, that doesn't really seem to be the problem.
[00:48:25] Let's try this over here.
[00:48:26] Now personally, what I have found is,
[00:48:28] and not everybody works this way, this is totally fine,
[00:48:31] is I like to go into like, how did you get here?
[00:48:36] Right, so I'm gonna ask all kinds of questions
[00:48:38] about what happened in the family
[00:48:40] and how were things talked about
[00:48:42] and what did you experience
[00:48:44] and how was that managed in the family?
[00:48:46] Because I see those things as they shape.
[00:48:49] So now we have this tapping that's happening right now
[00:48:52] where there's something probably that went on back then
[00:48:55] that has to do with it.
[00:48:56] Some therapists, some psychologists don't,
[00:49:00] they look at like what's happening right now
[00:49:01] and how do we move it forward?
[00:49:02] They are not gonna spend a lot of time in the past,
[00:49:04] it's preference, but I mean, I can't tell you
[00:49:07] how many times what walked through the door
[00:49:10] is not what we ended up finding.
[00:49:12] Sure, right, somebody, I mean,
[00:49:14] some of my earlier years in private practice,
[00:49:17] I worked a lot with eating disorders
[00:49:19] and because I was also still learning
[00:49:22] and didn't have as much experience
[00:49:25] as I would have within a few years as,
[00:49:27] oh, it's meal plan, this person is afraid of getting fat.
[00:49:31] This person thinks they're more popular
[00:49:34] but they're skinny, whatever, all of these things.
[00:49:36] So we would kind of target those behaviors.
[00:49:39] Let's get you on a good meal plan,
[00:49:41] let's talk about self-esteem, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:49:44] Over the years, it was kind of insane
[00:49:48] how much I discovered through looking back,
[00:49:51] like there was trauma in there
[00:49:53] or some kind of really defining event
[00:49:58] that happened in that young person's life,
[00:50:00] that the eating disorder behaviors, so to speak,
[00:50:04] were almost like the manifestation of something else.
[00:50:07] What kind of, what would be a something else?
[00:50:10] Like abuse, like often, especially with girls,
[00:50:15] you'd see like a sexual assault or sexual abuse.
[00:50:19] Sometimes that's something that was happening
[00:50:20] in the family that was not being talked about,
[00:50:23] would be kind of stuffed down
[00:50:27] and then expressed through these behaviors.
[00:50:30] So almost psychologically, you can interpret that
[00:50:34] a little bit as if we're spending all of our time over here
[00:50:36] on meal plans and weight gain and weight loss,
[00:50:38] what are we not looking at?
[00:50:40] The secret over here that nobody wants to talk about.
[00:50:43] So sometimes finding an origin
[00:50:49] that then explains the symptoms,
[00:50:52] then you treat the origin, the issue over here
[00:50:55] versus the symptoms, kind of like the analogy
[00:50:58] I've used a million times, even with clients, is
[00:51:01] if you come in with like a severe case of pneumonia
[00:51:05] and the only thing we're doing
[00:51:07] is giving you some cough syrup to help your cough,
[00:51:11] like that's gonna help a little bit.
[00:51:12] I mean, it's gonna help you feel a tiny bit better,
[00:51:14] but nothing, in fact, you might even get worse
[00:51:17] if we don't really treat the thing
[00:51:19] that's really underneath the cough.
[00:51:22] Like the cough actually is not really the issue.
[00:51:24] This is the other thing.
[00:51:25] Yeah, this is the really humanizing part
[00:51:27] in terms of what you're talking about,
[00:51:29] because I think we have to be really mindful
[00:51:31] and responsible as clinicians with how we talk
[00:51:34] about the use of diagnoses.
[00:51:36] In my private practice, I often get people coming to me
[00:51:38] that it's their first time they've reached out
[00:51:40] for mental health services, they've gone somewhere,
[00:51:42] and they spent just a short meeting with someone
[00:51:45] and they were given a diagnosis by polar disorder.
[00:51:47] Something that's very severe.
[00:51:48] They go look this up on the internet,
[00:51:50] they start attaching all these things to their personality.
[00:51:53] The web MD.
[00:51:54] And now I am bipolar disorder.
[00:51:57] I start to attach these things to my personality.
[00:52:00] And that language is very powerful over time,
[00:52:03] because if I am something or something is happening to me,
[00:52:05] I have much less control over how I respond to it
[00:52:07] as opposed to this idea that I'm experiencing
[00:52:11] some symptoms associated with bipolar disorder,
[00:52:14] or I'm experiencing some symptoms associated with this.
[00:52:16] Or after some reflection, I have an addressed trauma
[00:52:21] in my past that's showing up like very volatile outbursts
[00:52:25] or something like that.
[00:52:26] And so I think how we talk about it is really important.
[00:52:31] Because nowadays, and if you have kids my age,
[00:52:34] there's plenty of kids walking around self-diagnosed
[00:52:36] as OCD or depression or these sorts of things,
[00:52:39] because they hear about something and I am this
[00:52:41] and I can't do this because I have this.
[00:52:42] And so I think one of the first things we try to do
[00:52:46] with people is start to talk about the impact and history,
[00:52:49] because it allows us to create a framework to talk about things
[00:52:52] that are more humanizing,
[00:52:54] as opposed to the symptoms or like a label.
[00:53:00] So this made me think of something that I said a while ago.
[00:53:04] I looked up the definition of being insane.
[00:53:07] And being insane was when your reality
[00:53:10] doesn't match the reality of the world.
[00:53:12] And we have an online training program
[00:53:15] and I was telling you, I said, hey, everyone is insane.
[00:53:18] Everyone is to some level insane,
[00:53:20] because if the three of us witness an event
[00:53:23] or participate in an event,
[00:53:25] it's gonna be a little bit different for all of us.
[00:53:26] Like our reality is gonna be a little bit different.
[00:53:29] Well, no, you said this, I didn't say that, I said this.
[00:53:32] So we're gonna have different interpretations of reality.
[00:53:34] So everyone therefore is a little bit insane, right?
[00:53:37] And it's just how insane are you?
[00:53:41] And when you start looking at that,
[00:53:44] like the most horrifying thing, like anorexia,
[00:53:49] where the person is so clearly malnutritioned
[00:53:56] and so clearly like 100% of people in the world
[00:54:01] would say you need to eat more.
[00:54:04] And that one person, the person that has it,
[00:54:07] just they just don't see that.
[00:54:10] That's gotta be the scariest, scariest environment.
[00:54:14] Like for a parent, I can't even fathom
[00:54:17] what that's doing.
[00:54:20] So as you're talking about, Karlyn,
[00:54:23] you're talking about addressing the,
[00:54:26] like finding this original, this initial problem.
[00:54:30] And that's how we're able to address that,
[00:54:34] bring that into the light, get that thing solved,
[00:54:37] and it solves the symptom that we're all seeing.
[00:54:40] Pretty much.
[00:54:40] I mean, and that's the mechanic work, right?
[00:54:42] Is you're kind of digging.
[00:54:44] And sometimes the person will know,
[00:54:47] like I had this thing happen,
[00:54:49] and I think my symptoms are related to this.
[00:54:51] Sometimes they're not aware.
[00:54:53] I had a young girl that I was treating for anorexia.
[00:54:56] She was a cheerleader and a ballerina.
[00:54:59] So much pressure, right?
[00:55:01] To maintain this very malnourished, very thin body
[00:55:05] and all the guilt, like even eating something
[00:55:08] that had a carb in it, just like, I can't,
[00:55:11] I'm gonna get fathom, I'm not gonna get picked.
[00:55:13] I'm so destructive and interfering with life.
[00:55:18] So I'm working with her and I'm trying
[00:55:20] the end this thing and this thing,
[00:55:21] and we're trying it over here,
[00:55:22] and I don't know, your worth isn't wrapped up
[00:55:24] in your ballerina stuff.
[00:55:25] Nothing was happening.
[00:55:26] So you are focused on the physical life.
[00:55:28] At the time.
[00:55:29] You look fine.
[00:55:30] Because this is all she was presenting with is like,
[00:55:32] I know, like it's almost like, I know,
[00:55:34] this is not good for me,
[00:55:36] I just don't really know what to do about it.
[00:55:37] But there wasn't really much else.
[00:55:39] Try getting the parents in, they didn't wanna come in,
[00:55:41] which really should have been my first clue.
[00:55:44] And long story short, just to get to this point,
[00:55:47] is months and months of meeting with her and like,
[00:55:50] well, what about this?
[00:55:51] And I don't know, what about that?
[00:55:52] She says, well, you know, my mom said,
[00:55:57] she didn't want me to talk about this.
[00:56:00] But I feel like I should.
[00:56:02] I think I was molested by my cousin when I was like 12.
[00:56:06] I'm like, oh, so I'm like, here we go.
[00:56:09] So I'm asking her all these questions.
[00:56:11] And she just tells this really very sad,
[00:56:17] kind of horrible story about learning that she,
[00:56:21] like learning something at school that made her think,
[00:56:23] oh my God, I think that happened to me.
[00:56:25] Going home, telling her parents and her parents like,
[00:56:28] do not tell anybody about this,
[00:56:30] this is gonna ruin everybody's life, la, la, la, la.
[00:56:33] Right, just don't talk about it.
[00:56:35] Well, no, she's a ballerina.
[00:56:37] Right, like all that got stuffed down
[00:56:40] and kind of channeled in this way that she could control
[00:56:44] her environment a lot of time, a lot of the time.
[00:56:48] So we start unpacking this and it turns out,
[00:56:51] as she tells me about this event that made her think
[00:56:54] that she might have been molested, that's not what happened.
[00:56:57] She was in some class at school
[00:57:00] and they were talking about something
[00:57:01] and she like almost like misinterpreted.
[00:57:05] So this, for years, there was this whole thing
[00:57:08] that had happened in her family
[00:57:09] where she said she had been molested,
[00:57:10] but she really wasn't.
[00:57:14] They thought she was, shut it down,
[00:57:16] didn't let anybody talk about it,
[00:57:18] and now she's coming in for treatment
[00:57:20] for anxiety and an eating disorder, right?
[00:57:23] Soon as we got there and we got it and she was,
[00:57:26] I mean, she bought in, she was like,
[00:57:27] oh my God, I had no idea, at this point she's maybe 18.
[00:57:30] I think I started seeing her, she was just 15.
[00:57:32] Like all of a sudden, it was like all that symptomology
[00:57:37] went away.
[00:57:38] I mean, it didn't vanish overnight
[00:57:40] because she'd been doing those behaviors for a long time,
[00:57:42] but that clarity of like, oh, this is what this was about.
[00:57:46] This being made to be wrong.
[00:57:50] I thought this bad thing had happened to me
[00:57:52] and I was like essentially punished for it
[00:57:56] and told that if I tell and something happens to my cousin,
[00:57:59] it's gonna be my fault.
[00:58:01] So not being able to talk about it,
[00:58:03] being told by her mom, don't go talk about this in therapy.
[00:58:07] She wouldn't go to therapy for, right?
[00:58:08] But it was that, like that's an example of you kind of,
[00:58:11] we just had to peel and peel and ask questions
[00:58:14] and when we found it, it cleared up.
[00:58:17] Because right, like you said,
[00:58:18] like it kind of brought it into the light.
[00:58:20] We could address what the real problem was
[00:58:23] and then the symptoms, the cough, so to speak,
[00:58:27] alleviated because the root, the core,
[00:58:30] had been addressed.
[00:58:31] So there is a lot in psychological practice and treatment
[00:58:36] that does involve some...
[00:58:38] And it took you years, three years to get through this.
[00:58:41] I saw her every week.
[00:58:43] Because she, and she was really like,
[00:58:48] I was told not to talk about this.
[00:58:51] So she kind of knew something was back there,
[00:58:54] but she was also young and had been directed
[00:58:57] by her family, don't talk about this.
[00:58:59] If you talk about this and she calls the school
[00:59:01] and your cousin gets in trouble, then Aunt and Uncle,
[00:59:04] or like, you know, so just...
[00:59:07] But it was, what was, if you can go into it a little bit,
[00:59:10] like, well, you, because you said it didn't really happen,
[00:59:12] but she thought it happened.
[00:59:13] Well, yeah, so she said she was at school one day
[00:59:15] and they were doing one of these assemblies, right?
[00:59:17] Where you're giving like the kids education
[00:59:18] on healthy touch and inappropriate touch.
[00:59:21] Like, just, you know, maybe she's 15 at this time.
[00:59:24] She was also a very immature, only child,
[00:59:27] a little bit sheltered, so maturity-wise,
[00:59:30] she was a little, little behind, I think.
[00:59:34] And so she said, so this thing was happening
[00:59:37] and I told my friend, oh my God,
[00:59:38] I think I might have been molested
[00:59:40] because this thing happened with my cousin.
[00:59:42] So I'm like, okay, so can you tell me what happened
[00:59:44] with your cousin?
[00:59:45] So she tells me this event, which was really like,
[00:59:51] at a party one night, like all the cousins
[00:59:54] and aunts and uncles, the kids decided to like,
[00:59:57] play a joke and like, skinny dip.
[00:59:59] Like, they all went into the pool house,
[01:00:01] like, stripped off their clothes and like,
[01:00:02] ran into the pool and made a big joke
[01:00:06] and everyone got in trouble
[01:00:07] because the parents were there and this kind of thing.
[01:00:09] And she goes, it was my cousin's idea.
[01:00:11] So, okay.
[01:00:13] She goes, so he molested me, right?
[01:00:15] I'm like, what?
[01:00:18] What?
[01:00:20] In her mind.
[01:00:21] She had, because she heard this thing at school
[01:00:24] and her friend said, oh my God,
[01:00:25] it was your cousin that said you should take off your bathing.
[01:00:27] So I think that's molest.
[01:00:28] I think that's inappropriate, whatever.
[01:00:29] Like it grew into this thing.
[01:00:32] But when she really, when we went back
[01:00:34] and walked through the event,
[01:00:35] she goes, well, no, it was, it was my cousin's idea.
[01:00:37] But like, we all did it.
[01:00:38] No one touched anybody.
[01:00:41] It was, we thought it would be funny.
[01:00:43] So tragic.
[01:00:45] I mean, this is, this, to me, and she did,
[01:00:48] once we got there, she did beautifully.
[01:00:49] She's off at college.
[01:00:51] I mean, doing wonderfully, but the years, right?
[01:00:55] Of a misunderstanding of something that happened.
[01:00:57] It was all like the telephone game, right?
[01:00:59] She told this person, they told this,
[01:01:02] it just by the time it arrived at her parents,
[01:01:04] it was this whole other thing.
[01:01:06] Scary.
[01:01:07] So scary.
[01:01:08] Megan, something you were talking about
[01:01:10] when you were talking about,
[01:01:11] oh, people kind of self-diagnosed at some point
[01:01:14] where they get a diagnosis from somebody.
[01:01:17] And oh yeah, we had a friend of mine on here.
[01:01:20] There's an ancient native American saying
[01:01:23] that something along the lines of,
[01:01:26] it's not a diagnosis, it's a curse.
[01:01:29] Like if you get diagnosed with something
[01:01:31] and you can hear it as a curse, like this is what you are.
[01:01:36] How much play does it give to me?
[01:01:40] I mean, well, obviously I wrote a book
[01:01:41] called Extreme Ownership, Taking Ownership,
[01:01:43] of like what's going on in your world.
[01:01:45] And instead of being, oh, I'm bipolar, that's what I am.
[01:01:48] It's like, no, I have some symptoms
[01:01:50] and here's how I'm gonna get control of this.
[01:01:52] Is that something that comes into play
[01:01:55] in getting people moving in the right direction?
[01:01:58] I would say absolutely yes.
[01:02:00] I mean, because what we're trying to do is help people
[01:02:04] identify differently with what's happening in their life
[01:02:06] or create a new narrative or story
[01:02:08] around what's going on in their life.
[01:02:09] So, I mean, this happens not just with the individual,
[01:02:12] but with families, right?
[01:02:14] Like if I'm, if I hear that my kiddo
[01:02:16] who's historically done really well,
[01:02:18] they're talented, they've done it well in music,
[01:02:20] all through high school, all of a sudden they're in their
[01:02:21] first or second year of college
[01:02:23] and they're starting to display
[01:02:24] some really interesting symptoms.
[01:02:27] They have their first psychotic break.
[01:02:28] It's like devastating for a family.
[01:02:30] Like what happened?
[01:02:31] It's very common or on that age frame
[01:02:32] for something like this to happen.
[01:02:35] All of these ideas start coming up.
[01:02:39] My son has schizophrenia.
[01:02:40] He'll never be able to get married.
[01:02:42] He'll never be able to hold down a job.
[01:02:45] We're never gonna see our son graduate from college.
[01:02:48] We're not gonna be able to do the family vacations.
[01:02:50] You just say it just goes on and on.
[01:02:52] And so you sit with these families
[01:02:53] and there's just such a sense of hopelessness.
[01:02:56] And so what we try to do is come back a little bit to say,
[01:03:00] like, well, you know, why don't you think
[01:03:03] he's able to live alone?
[01:03:05] Well, he hasn't taken out the trash all week.
[01:03:07] His room is a mess.
[01:03:08] He stays in there all by himself.
[01:03:10] Well, how come, how was he able to do that?
[01:03:12] Like how was he able to sit in his room all day
[01:03:15] and like not experience the natural consequences?
[01:03:17] So say, if I went in my room all day,
[01:03:18] stop going to school or work or whatever it may be,
[01:03:21] like things would fall apart in my life.
[01:03:22] How is that able to happen?
[01:03:23] And so what we can get to,
[01:03:26] and this takes a lot of time,
[01:03:27] is essentially the fear associated with like,
[01:03:30] if I was to push him towards something
[01:03:32] or if he's not capable or because of this illness,
[01:03:35] now he can't do this.
[01:03:36] And we have to really unpack,
[01:03:37] and it's different for every family,
[01:03:39] but we have to really unpack that to figure out
[01:03:41] what it is that they've decided collectively.
[01:03:44] This means for their life, right?
[01:03:46] These symptoms or this diagnosis,
[01:03:47] and then help them envision something
[01:03:49] sort of different for themselves.
[01:03:50] And then create experiences for individuals to play that out.
[01:03:54] Well, he's been taking out the trash all week here,
[01:03:56] and if he doesn't, his peer tells them like,
[01:03:58] hey, you didn't take out the trash,
[01:03:59] and so go do that,
[01:04:00] or experience some of the natural consequences
[01:04:04] associated with IFI,
[01:04:05] just leave my stuff everywhere.
[01:04:08] You know, my roommate tells me like,
[01:04:10] hey, you know, room like stinks,
[01:04:11] can you like clean this up?
[01:04:13] Like some of that peer to peer interaction,
[01:04:14] but we have to create those opportunities for that.
[01:04:17] And then interestingly,
[01:04:18] when people start to engage in this,
[01:04:19] they just not like a cognitive like,
[01:04:20] oh yeah, I'll go do this thing,
[01:04:22] and something will be different.
[01:04:23] It's usually more like I act,
[01:04:25] I have these experiences,
[01:04:26] I walk through something difficult,
[01:04:28] my symptoms got really activated
[01:04:29] when I was gonna go try to learn how to take the bus,
[01:04:32] or do the trolley,
[01:04:33] but you know what, like, I had someone with me,
[01:04:35] and I was able to do it,
[01:04:36] and it was like okay,
[01:04:37] and it didn't stay that way forever.
[01:04:38] And so the kind of the insight comes a little bit later,
[01:04:42] with the experience,
[01:04:44] that like I can experience some discomfort,
[01:04:46] or I can let my kiddo struggle a little bit,
[01:04:49] or go through something,
[01:04:50] and I can actually tolerate some of my fear
[01:04:52] that this could be like devastating for him.
[01:04:54] Because you know, oftentimes,
[01:04:56] when we get to it, especially for families who have,
[01:04:59] you know, we're sort of in a good place
[01:05:02] if a family's coming to us at a first break,
[01:05:04] because we can help them like right there,
[01:05:06] but oftentimes people come to us 14 hospitals.
[01:05:09] Like a last resort type thing.
[01:05:10] 14 hospitalizations in multiple short term treatment centers.
[01:05:14] What does break look like?
[01:05:15] What does that look like?
[01:05:16] I mean, it looks like a break from reality.
[01:05:19] It's different for each person.
[01:05:20] You know, that process sometimes can appear
[01:05:24] like what you see more often in like movies,
[01:05:26] in such sort of bizarre, or paranoia, or I see aliens.
[01:05:29] Sometimes for people with significant personality disorders,
[01:05:32] and this way like delusions can be grounded
[01:05:34] almost in something like that feels real.
[01:05:36] Like it could be a real situation,
[01:05:38] but it's in fact not when you get down to it.
[01:05:41] So, but ultimately it's just a disconnect
[01:05:44] from what's happening in the here and now,
[01:05:46] in a lot of different ways, and it could be auditory,
[01:05:48] it could be tactile in terms of a person's experience
[01:05:51] of what they're feeling in their body,
[01:05:53] maybe visual, just a break from reality.
[01:05:57] A break from reality.
[01:05:58] So, a family, they got a 18 year old kid,
[01:06:02] a 20 year old kid, they're in college,
[01:06:05] they're going to college, everything's fine,
[01:06:06] and then all of a sudden, just give me an example.
[01:06:08] What does this look like?
[01:06:09] So, I mean, for example, what it might look like
[01:06:11] is they're calling home and like,
[01:06:12] my neighbors are, they're listening to me.
[01:06:14] My neighbors are really bothering me.
[01:06:16] Like they're listening through the walls.
[01:06:18] I know that they're doing these things.
[01:06:19] So, this is like an obvious.
[01:06:21] I mean, it could be, yes,
[01:06:23] or it could be as a parent you're hearing this,
[01:06:24] you're like, that's really odd.
[01:06:25] Like why would the neighbors be listening to them?
[01:06:28] Or so sometimes this can go on for a period of time
[01:06:30] where there's like some things that, you know,
[01:06:32] you notice some more isolation
[01:06:33] or not hanging out with friends as much,
[01:06:35] or maybe there's some substance use that is sort of new.
[01:06:38] And so it's not always so like in your face obvious.
[01:06:41] It might not be like the neighbors are watching me.
[01:06:43] It might be like, oh, I'm not doing anything this weekend.
[01:06:46] Or even how many times we've had,
[01:06:49] like somebody come into the treatment program
[01:06:51] and the parents say, well,
[01:06:54] we thought everything was great.
[01:06:55] He's at college, like he seems like he's fine,
[01:06:57] but we started getting calls from his friends.
[01:07:00] Hey, we think something's going on.
[01:07:02] It's not really coming out anymore.
[01:07:03] Seems to be hanging out in his room all the time.
[01:07:05] But then we call him and he says he's okay.
[01:07:08] Right, so there's this like,
[01:07:09] we don't really know what's going on
[01:07:11] and how many times we've had, you know, family sales.
[01:07:14] So we just decided to like get in the car
[01:07:16] and drive up there and see what was going on for ourselves.
[01:07:18] And they find their kid like disheveled,
[01:07:22] maybe haven't been eating.
[01:07:23] So what's going on with that kid?
[01:07:25] Well, like what's an example of, okay, I get the call.
[01:07:29] Hey, your son is, he's, hey, you know, Billy,
[01:07:33] Billy's not come out with us for like three weeks.
[01:07:36] We haven't even seen him.
[01:07:37] We just want to call you and let you know,
[01:07:38] like he's really been acting weird.
[01:07:40] And so I call Billy and Billy says, no, I'm fine.
[01:07:42] I just been studying really hard.
[01:07:44] This has been a pain in school
[01:07:45] and I'm really sick of Fred anyways.
[01:07:47] So I'm just doing my own thing.
[01:07:48] I go, okay.
[01:07:50] And then, you know, I get another call.
[01:07:52] It's his ex-girlfriend.
[01:07:53] You know, I just, I saw him the other day.
[01:07:55] He just looked totally different.
[01:07:57] So I drive up there and there he is in his room.
[01:08:01] His room is a mess.
[01:08:03] What's going on with him?
[01:08:04] What is it?
[01:08:05] Is it something that he saw?
[01:08:09] Is it something that got triggered?
[01:08:11] Is it like, what is it?
[01:08:14] Do we know?
[01:08:16] Sometimes we do and sometimes we won't.
[01:08:17] And this is where like the mechanic has to come in, right?
[01:08:19] And figure it out.
[01:08:20] Sometimes it's going to be very obvious.
[01:08:21] Like a more common scenario that we've experienced is like,
[01:08:25] everything was fine.
[01:08:26] Star athlete, blah, blah, blah, goes to college,
[01:08:29] seems to be making friends,
[01:08:30] decided to start smoking weed a little bit and then boom.
[01:08:34] Right?
[01:08:35] It set something off.
[01:08:36] Some people can smoke weed, that will not happen.
[01:08:40] You know, there's some theory and hypothesis
[01:08:43] that some people, you can be like predisposed
[01:08:48] for schizophrenia or psychosis,
[01:08:50] but it not necessarily come out,
[01:08:53] but it will under certain conditions
[01:08:55] and sometimes drug use is one of those.
[01:08:57] So you can have somebody who's predisposed,
[01:08:59] like has genetic loading and never kind of becomes
[01:09:03] systematic.
[01:09:04] All life and you could be one of these people.
[01:09:06] And then you've got somebody who has a genetic predisposition
[01:09:11] and they go to college and they start smoking a little weed
[01:09:14] and it like cracks something open internally and here it comes.
[01:09:19] But it could be a girlfriend breakup.
[01:09:20] Totally.
[01:09:21] Could be, you know, getting into the frat or whatever.
[01:09:26] Disappointment.
[01:09:27] Just something like that.
[01:09:29] And this can, in some cases,
[01:09:30] people can just kind of, they're changing.
[01:09:33] And sometimes it goes away naturally.
[01:09:36] Sometimes it's like, oh yeah,
[01:09:38] he was bummed out for a few weeks,
[01:09:39] but hey, we just saw Billy,
[01:09:41] he's actually, he's come forward.
[01:09:42] He's supposed to do it better.
[01:09:43] Sure, yeah.
[01:09:44] And it's, we can get, a person can get through it.
[01:09:48] Sure, we've had folks come in,
[01:09:49] like the one person I'm thinking about was,
[01:09:52] I think he was in his freshman year at college.
[01:09:54] Again, great student, scholarship, football.
[01:10:00] I mean, just a lot of friends, great girl.
[01:10:02] Like just really kind of all around.
[01:10:04] And they got a call.
[01:10:05] The parents got a call from the police,
[01:10:07] the local police in their son's town,
[01:10:11] that they found him like running around outside,
[01:10:14] like half naked, like kind of crazy,
[01:10:16] screaming and doing weird things.
[01:10:18] And they're like, wait, did you call the right people?
[01:10:20] That was not my kid.
[01:10:22] Well, he had smoked, he had never done drugs,
[01:10:25] or you know, maybe he had it a little bit.
[01:10:27] But smoked weed and he couldn't,
[01:10:29] he's like, I don't know, someone just gave it to me.
[01:10:30] So who knows what was in there?
[01:10:32] Well, it did something to this guy's brain.
[01:10:34] I mean, it just scrambled him.
[01:10:36] He did not know what way it was up or down,
[01:10:38] went into the hospital.
[01:10:40] They brought him to us for treatment,
[01:10:42] never been in treatment.
[01:10:42] I mean, had never had anything happen like this before.
[01:10:45] He was back in school, I think by the next semester.
[01:10:49] Like he needed, he came in, you know, we got him settled,
[01:10:53] kind of walked through what happened.
[01:10:55] Soon as the drugs were out of his system,
[01:10:58] which didn't take a long time,
[01:10:59] because he wasn't really a chronic user.
[01:11:02] He cleared, like he instantly cleared in his mind.
[01:11:05] So in that case, diagnosis-wise,
[01:11:09] it was a substance-induced psychosis.
[01:11:13] Substance-induced psychosis.
[01:11:16] So soon as the substances were out of his symptoms,
[01:11:21] there was no more psychosis.
[01:11:22] He cleared.
[01:11:23] So really, it was just helping him almost recover from,
[01:11:27] I mean, that was a traumatic event.
[01:11:29] And he was embarrassed and had all the shame.
[01:11:31] There was like a lot of stuff.
[01:11:32] He had to kind of process and recover from,
[01:11:35] and then he went back to college.
[01:11:37] Same school.
[01:11:38] Well, an early intervention there is huge.
[01:11:40] Super early.
[01:11:41] Because, you know, the further away the intervention,
[01:11:43] the person starts to find ways to self-sue
[01:11:45] there whatever might be,
[01:11:46] and it becomes much more complex at that point.
[01:11:49] So if someone has one episode,
[01:11:53] they're easier to help than someone that's had 28.
[01:11:57] And the parents were just like,
[01:11:58] oh, he'll be fine.
[01:11:59] Oh, it's just Billy.
[01:12:00] He's just, he acts up sometimes,
[01:12:01] and then that goes on for three, four, five years.
[01:12:04] He's gonna be harder to treat.
[01:12:06] Or the brain stays in a constant state of psychosis
[01:12:08] for a longer period of time.
[01:12:10] It's hard to know what it's gonna look like
[01:12:11] when they come out of that, right?
[01:12:13] Explain what psychosis actually means.
[01:12:18] You wanna go?
[01:12:19] Yeah, well, it's, well, you had said it earlier.
[01:12:21] It's a break in reality.
[01:12:23] Psychosis typically is defined as a break
[01:12:28] in contact with reality.
[01:12:30] And what's interesting though about psychosis,
[01:12:32] and I say this in the presentation and in the book,
[01:12:36] is people can be psychotic,
[01:12:40] people can be psychotic, have a psychotic episode,
[01:12:42] and it not be related to a mental illness.
[01:12:44] Right.
[01:12:45] What would that look like?
[01:12:48] Anesthesia.
[01:12:50] Like under anesthesia,
[01:12:51] people have reported hallucinating, malnourishment
[01:12:54] and dehydration, somebody can hallucinate,
[01:12:56] hear voices, have delusions.
[01:12:59] Sleep deprivation.
[01:13:00] Sleep deprivation 100%.
[01:13:03] So there are a lot.
[01:13:04] In CO training, they keep you awake for a long time.
[01:13:06] And you know, we wouldn't be surprised
[01:13:07] if you are seeing some things
[01:13:09] that maybe are not actually there.
[01:13:10] Yeah, I was out on the boat in the middle of the ocean,
[01:13:12] and I thought I saw like traffic lights,
[01:13:15] and I was like, hey, we gotta stop.
[01:13:17] And I actually knew that I was hallucinating.
[01:13:18] I was like, that can't be real,
[01:13:20] because I'm in the ocean, but that definitely is a stoplight.
[01:13:22] And I think we should stop,
[01:13:23] but that doesn't make any sense.
[01:13:25] Head injury.
[01:13:28] So psychotic event is when you're disconnected
[01:13:33] from reality in a big way.
[01:13:34] Yeah, like a break and kind of the contact in reality.
[01:13:37] Like seeing something that isn't there,
[01:13:39] feeling, hearing something, or delusion, right?
[01:13:42] Like a belief that somebody's following me,
[01:13:45] somebody's watching me, somebody's out to get me.
[01:13:49] I was telling one of my friends the other day
[01:13:53] in supervision that one of my very first patients
[01:13:55] who had schizophrenia, and he was pretty severe,
[01:13:58] had a belief that he was like,
[01:14:01] every once in a while he was reincarnated as somebody else.
[01:14:04] So, but like, you know, sometimes he would talk about that,
[01:14:08] like funny, he would be like, oh my God,
[01:14:10] Karlyn, remember last week when I told you
[01:14:12] I thought I was Ram Dass?
[01:14:14] I'm like, mm-hmm, I do remember that.
[01:14:16] He's like, wow, that was really weird, oh my God.
[01:14:18] Oh, so he kind of knew it.
[01:14:19] And then he wouldn't, like then sometimes he wouldn't.
[01:14:21] He'd be like so in it and very like fixed
[01:14:26] that you really couldn't kind of talk him out of it,
[01:14:30] so to speak.
[01:14:30] So here I'm gonna open up just the biggest can of worms.
[01:14:33] What the hell happens when I'm on the internet
[01:14:36] and social media and I'm starting to think
[01:14:38] that I'm a little bit conspiratorial
[01:14:41] and I start reading various websites
[01:14:45] that are just totally Reddit,
[01:14:49] which is like a website that has a bunch of different
[01:14:52] random things, I mean, I guess they all do.
[01:14:54] I mean, you can go down, you can do any Reddit, YouTube,
[01:14:57] any one of these things, you can go watch something
[01:14:59] on YouTube that if you have a little bit of an indication
[01:15:02] that the world might be flat,
[01:15:04] you guys heard of Flat Earthers?
[01:15:06] Yeah, that.
[01:15:07] Yep, they're out there.
[01:15:07] Yeah, the Earth is flat and there's videos upon videos
[01:15:11] upon threads upon threads of the Earth is flat.
[01:15:14] So if you have a little bit of paranoia about something,
[01:15:18] that can't be good for you.
[01:15:20] You have to be really mindful of that.
[01:15:22] The internet is a dangerous place.
[01:15:25] Like WebMD, self-diagnosing.
[01:15:27] Oh yeah.
[01:15:32] How bad is that?
[01:15:33] Like, I mean, you talk about, oh, somebody can smoke weed.
[01:15:37] How bad is it if I think, you know what,
[01:15:39] I really think that there's a world order
[01:15:42] that's trying to keep me down?
[01:15:43] Well, I mean, I think it depends on the person
[01:15:45] and their ability to sort of like self-moderate
[01:15:47] their exposure to stuff like that.
[01:15:49] Cause if you're in a healthier place
[01:15:51] and you can moderate your exposure to that
[01:15:53] and you realize, gosh, I just spent two hours
[01:15:55] scrolling through this, super unhealthy,
[01:15:56] I'm not feeling good and I can set some sort of boundaries
[01:15:58] for myself around that, then like, what's, it's positive.
[01:16:01] You know, I think we all have the tendency
[01:16:03] towards indulgence in some ways.
[01:16:05] But for someone who struggles with that
[01:16:07] or who's coming to us and like every time
[01:16:08] they turn on the news, there's a significant amount
[01:16:10] of paranoia for them and that causes them to act
[01:16:12] in response to those delusions or thoughts
[01:16:14] in a way that's like harmful to them or others.
[01:16:17] Well, then we help moderate some of that.
[01:16:19] You know, a lot of the treatment that we do
[01:16:20] and why it takes so much time is creating
[01:16:22] some scaffolding around things like that.
[01:16:23] So the people can develop that insight
[01:16:25] if it's not readily available to them
[01:16:27] because with something like schizophrenia,
[01:16:29] I mean, it's a thought disorder.
[01:16:30] It's impacting your cognition,
[01:16:32] your ability to think in a lot of ways.
[01:16:33] And so if someone is not able to self-regulate
[01:16:36] in that way, we help create some scaffolding for them.
[01:16:39] So like maybe we're not watching the news at five tonight
[01:16:41] because that's not gonna end up good
[01:16:43] because every time you do, you end up out on the streets
[01:16:45] or whatever it might be in an embarrassing state.
[01:16:47] You just don't want me to watch the news
[01:16:49] because you don't want to know what's going on
[01:16:50] because you're part of a conspiracy.
[01:16:52] Well, a lot of times, which is why it's so important
[01:16:55] to build a sense of rapport and safety with someone,
[01:16:59] to be consistent in what you're doing
[01:17:00] and have an environment that's consistent
[01:17:02] so that people feel safe enough
[01:17:03] to allow you to support them.
[01:17:04] And they will in a lot of ways with time.
[01:17:09] But the work that we do is not a quick fix.
[01:17:11] People spend a long period of time with us
[01:17:16] and so that we can develop enough safety
[01:17:19] where they will buy into trying some of the things
[01:17:21] that we're requesting or suggesting might be helpful for them.
[01:17:26] And so that then they can develop some of their own insight.
[01:17:28] Like, oh, wow, I haven't had this much paranoia
[01:17:31] or I haven't been this kind of undone for a period of time
[01:17:34] and I also haven't watched the news for this period of time.
[01:17:37] Like maybe that is helpful for me.
[01:17:39] And then usually when they come to the latter part
[01:17:41] of their time or their journey where they're more
[01:17:43] in like an outpatient type setting,
[01:17:45] they can reflect back some of those things.
[01:17:47] Like I didn't like the structure that you put me on
[01:17:49] or I didn't like this particular thing,
[01:17:52] but I realize now why that was so helpful for me.
[01:17:55] Do people have to be open to wanting to change
[01:18:00] in order to change?
[01:18:02] And if you have someone that's just like,
[01:18:04] the parent put them in there, the 23 year old kid,
[01:18:06] hey, look, you're going in here, you're gonna get fixed.
[01:18:09] That's like all of our people.
[01:18:11] From our perspective is especially when you're working
[01:18:15] with something like a thought disorder like schizophrenia,
[01:18:17] a systemic containment is incredibly helpful.
[01:18:21] Systemic containment?
[01:18:22] Meaning that the family is helping to support
[01:18:25] some sort of boundaries around the options
[01:18:28] that the child has in a lot of ways.
[01:18:30] Because sometimes people will come to us
[01:18:31] and their kiddo has schizophrenia,
[01:18:33] that they don't want to come to treatment,
[01:18:35] they don't want to do these things,
[01:18:36] they don't want to do some things that are gonna help them.
[01:18:38] Wait, the kid doesn't?
[01:18:39] The kid doesn't.
[01:18:40] But yet, and the family's like,
[01:18:42] I don't know what to do, he doesn't want to come.
[01:18:44] So like, well, how does he have this car?
[01:18:47] How does he have this apartment?
[01:18:48] He's like not able to work.
[01:18:50] And so we help the family really create some structures
[01:18:52] around like sort of some boundaries in a way of like,
[01:18:55] I'm here to support you and I'm gonna help you
[01:18:57] on this journey within the context of this realm
[01:18:59] that's gonna be helpful for you.
[01:19:00] But you've gotta do your part type of thing.
[01:19:01] Exactly, so a lot of times when folks come,
[01:19:03] they aren't necessarily happy to be there,
[01:19:05] but they just don't have a lot of options.
[01:19:07] And we really work with family, extended family,
[01:19:09] grandparents, whatnot to be like,
[01:19:10] don't send that $500 check because if you do,
[01:19:13] I know you feel bad and he doesn't have any money,
[01:19:15] he's probably gonna be out on the streets drinking
[01:19:17] or whatever it might be.
[01:19:18] And so we work with as many people as we can
[01:19:20] to create a nice safe container in some ways,
[01:19:23] which is the treatment environment.
[01:19:25] Because with what we do, it's not a locked setting.
[01:19:27] It's sort of the least restrictive type of environment
[01:19:30] in a residential setting, but it requires a ton of containment
[01:19:33] and support from every member of like the community
[01:19:35] that's working there in the family to make sure that
[01:19:38] there's a path and maybe there's a couple options
[01:19:40] to the path, but it's really clear and they're tight
[01:19:42] and contained so that the person can actually have
[01:19:46] some experiences and we can calm down some of the things
[01:19:48] that are happening in these symptoms so that they can begin
[01:19:51] to develop some of their own insight or understanding
[01:19:53] as to why.
[01:19:54] And sometimes, the hardest part about the work that we do
[01:19:57] is that you can want to help someone,
[01:19:58] you can want to save them, you can want to,
[01:20:02] and they might not want that and it might not be the choice
[01:20:05] that they have for themselves and we've had to walk through
[01:20:09] losses in that way as well.
[01:20:11] So I do think there is a component of that person wanting
[01:20:14] some of that and even if somebody on the surface
[01:20:17] doesn't want it, families and the people around them
[01:20:20] can do a lot to create an environment for them
[01:20:21] where they can grow in that desire for themselves.
[01:20:25] And sometimes people don't.
[01:20:29] So this is like a tough love scenario in some way.
[01:20:33] Am I right?
[01:20:34] It's like a tough love scenario.
[01:20:35] So sometimes, I've got friends and they might be having
[01:20:41] a hard time with whatever, maybe they're drinking
[01:20:46] or they're not doing what they should be doing.
[01:20:49] And I think most of the time what they need is,
[01:20:55] bro, what are you doing?
[01:20:56] You're being an idiot, stop doing that.
[01:20:58] And they go, yeah, man, you know what, I'm being an idiot.
[01:21:00] I need to stop doing that.
[01:21:01] It seems like that's a vast majority of the time
[01:21:03] of what people need.
[01:21:04] What scares me is, you know, if I say,
[01:21:08] what are you doing?
[01:21:09] You're being an idiot.
[01:21:11] And they really do have like some significant issue
[01:21:13] that they don't have any control over.
[01:21:15] They can't help.
[01:21:15] And all of a sudden I was just the worst friend ever
[01:21:19] by saying, dude, you're being a wimp,
[01:21:21] just get over it and move forward.
[01:21:23] And they think, oh, Jocko's saying I'm a wimp.
[01:21:27] That means I really am a wimp.
[01:21:28] That means I'm not good enough.
[01:21:30] And they go down and I'm worried
[01:21:32] that they would go down a spiral as opposed to,
[01:21:36] hey man, stop acting like that.
[01:21:37] Hey, quit blaming this incident
[01:21:40] on the way you're acting now.
[01:21:41] You know, you need to show up to work on time.
[01:21:44] You need to get a job.
[01:21:45] You need to stop drinking.
[01:21:46] Sometimes like that's, and I think actually most of the time
[01:21:50] people just need like, bro, what are you doing?
[01:21:52] And I'm talking bro because these are my friends
[01:21:55] that are dudes.
[01:21:57] Even though oddly enough, my daughters call each other bro.
[01:22:00] And they call all their friends bro that are all females.
[01:22:04] They got it down.
[01:22:05] Yeah, so, but is there some way to discern
[01:22:11] whether someone's crossed the line into,
[01:22:13] okay, listen, tough love isn't gonna help this individual
[01:22:16] anymore and I need to get them some real help?
[01:22:18] Cause that's the scary thing.
[01:22:21] I'll experience that with a person that I know
[01:22:23] and acquaintance that I have, a friend that I have that,
[01:22:26] oh, he's not looking good, right?
[01:22:29] Stop working out, which to me is a big indicator of,
[01:22:32] oh, stop working out.
[01:22:33] Doesn't, you know, not to really eat like crap
[01:22:35] and seems to be drinking a lot.
[01:22:38] And what I wanna say and what I have said to do guys is,
[01:22:42] bro, what are you doing?
[01:22:43] Why are you not working out?
[01:22:45] You're getting fat.
[01:22:46] What are you doing?
[01:22:46] Like, how much are you drinking?
[01:22:48] Are you drinking every night?
[01:22:49] What's wrong with you?
[01:22:50] Get back on the path.
[01:22:51] Like stop.
[01:22:52] And oftentimes they're like, yeah, but I've been so lazy.
[01:22:55] I need to, I've been thinking about this thing,
[01:22:57] but you're right, I need to keep going.
[01:22:59] But then I get the feeling sometimes is like,
[01:23:01] it's deeper and worse.
[01:23:04] Is there any way to discern?
[01:23:06] Is there any warning signs to look out for
[01:23:08] between these two individuals,
[01:23:10] one of whom needs this good kick in the ass
[01:23:13] that's gonna get them moving in the right direction?
[01:23:15] And the other one, I kick them in the ass,
[01:23:17] they're gonna fall down the stairs
[01:23:18] and it's gonna hurt them.
[01:23:20] I mean, that's a tough question.
[01:23:22] I mean, discernment is important
[01:23:24] in knowing people's history and such,
[01:23:25] especially in the work we do.
[01:23:26] I think it's different, you know,
[01:23:27] when you're looking from a clinical perspective,
[01:23:29] but discernment is huge.
[01:23:30] And at the same time, I think one of the hardest things
[01:23:33] in loving or caring about somebody
[01:23:34] who's struggling with something is that
[01:23:35] we don't necessarily have control
[01:23:37] over how they respond to what we try to give them.
[01:23:39] And so, you know, coming from a place of,
[01:23:41] if my approach is tough love
[01:23:44] in terms of what you're describing
[01:23:45] and like what you're being honest and true to yourself,
[01:23:49] and can also add that other part of like,
[01:23:50] there's a part of me that's sort of fearful
[01:23:52] that if I have tough love on you,
[01:23:54] that's like, this is gonna go kind of sideways for you.
[01:23:56] Does that feel true for you?
[01:23:57] And just sort of being direct and honest with people.
[01:23:59] I mean, I think people can feel congruency.
[01:24:01] They can feel care.
[01:24:02] And tough love, if it's coming from a place that's like love,
[01:24:06] it's felt very differently than something that's critical
[01:24:09] or mean or suggests like,
[01:24:11] I'm gonna cut you off from my life
[01:24:12] if you don't do this thing.
[01:24:14] That's very different.
[01:24:15] So when we talk about tough love,
[01:24:17] and oftentimes it is working families,
[01:24:18] you're like, this isn't mean.
[01:24:19] This is actually the most loving thing you could do
[01:24:21] for this person because to say nothing
[01:24:24] or to let them continue on in a way
[01:24:26] where their life is just deteriorating,
[01:24:27] well, that would be horrible, right?
[01:24:30] So like to do nothing would be very harmful.
[01:24:33] And so I don't think, I mean,
[01:24:35] this is the hardest thing about severe mental illness
[01:24:38] is that we can try a lot, we can say a lot,
[01:24:40] we can do things we don't necessarily have control
[01:24:42] over what somebody's gonna do with the feedback
[01:24:44] that we give them.
[01:24:46] And there's risk too, right?
[01:24:47] There's definitely risk involved
[01:24:49] in doing some of those things.
[01:24:51] And it doesn't always have a positive outcome
[01:24:55] to set boundaries and things like that.
[01:24:57] And at the same time, I think being congruent
[01:25:01] is like most important.
[01:25:03] And I think what you said earlier about rapport,
[01:25:06] like I think about some of the clients
[01:25:07] I've seen for the longest,
[01:25:09] I mean, I have relationships with these,
[01:25:10] I know these guys, you know these guys.
[01:25:12] Like I can tell, like and I can,
[01:25:15] because I have rapport, I always joke,
[01:25:17] like you've heard me say this in supervision,
[01:25:19] like I'm sometimes surprised myself
[01:25:21] with how much I can get away with saying.
[01:25:23] Because I have enough rapport
[01:25:24] where I know the person's gonna be able to handle it.
[01:25:26] Even if it's something like,
[01:25:28] I have a client this literally just happened.
[01:25:29] I said, you sound like a crazy person right now.
[01:25:34] And she's like, I know, don't I?
[01:25:35] I said, you kinda do.
[01:25:36] Now I wouldn't say that to everybody
[01:25:38] and if I didn't have that kind of relationship
[01:25:40] with a different client, I'm not gonna say that.
[01:25:41] That could be construed as like rude and very not PC, right?
[01:25:45] But with her, I can say it like,
[01:25:46] you're doing that thing right now
[01:25:48] where you just, you kinda sound
[01:25:49] and look like a crazy person.
[01:25:50] Can you pull it together?
[01:25:51] And she'll be like, okay, you know, we move on.
[01:25:54] But if I were to say that to her, say one afternoon
[01:25:57] and she can't pull it together,
[01:25:59] or she, how dare you say that to me?
[01:26:02] Or she reacts in a way that's different
[01:26:04] than my experience of her typically.
[01:26:07] You know, that's gonna be my discerning clue of like,
[01:26:09] okay, this might be something a little bit more
[01:26:11] than she's just having a moment.
[01:26:14] Like I know her enough or I know him enough
[01:26:16] to know like, oh, I kinda pulled the like, come on,
[01:26:20] get your shit together.
[01:26:21] I know you can do this and it works.
[01:26:24] And the times when it seems to not really be working,
[01:26:27] then it's just my clue that, okay,
[01:26:28] there maybe is something a little bit more happening here.
[01:26:30] So I'm just gonna like change my approach a little bit,
[01:26:33] slow it down and maybe ask more questions instead of say,
[01:26:36] hey, come on, get it together and move on.
[01:26:38] It might be like, so what's happening?
[01:26:40] Because you seem different to me today
[01:26:42] than you did last week, what's going on?
[01:26:44] I might ask a little bit more to see if more comes out.
[01:26:49] But I think there's a place for both.
[01:26:51] People really, especially people
[01:26:54] who are very disorganized internally,
[01:26:56] which you will see more with psychosis,
[01:26:58] or just in a funk, in their depression,
[01:27:01] in their grief, whatever, whatever.
[01:27:05] They need actually like the scaffolding on the outside.
[01:27:09] Somebody to say, okay, you know what?
[01:27:10] You need to get up, go take a shower,
[01:27:13] brush your teeth, meet me in the kitchen in 15 minutes.
[01:27:16] Like that kind of direction actually helps gel
[01:27:19] some of the looseness that's happening internally
[01:27:22] when someone's really struggling.
[01:27:23] And then there's gonna be times hopefully
[01:27:25] when that's not needed,
[01:27:26] that they can do that for themselves.
[01:27:29] From, this is sort of, I guess, parallel
[01:27:33] or at least adjacent to the social media stuff
[01:27:35] we were talking about this,
[01:27:36] the idea that we did a podcast on social contagions, right?
[01:27:40] Which is, and I think one of the best examples
[01:27:43] that I read about was bulimia.
[01:27:45] And when the first reported case of bulimia
[01:27:49] was in 1979 or something like this,
[01:27:51] I forget the dates, but this guy did an article
[01:27:56] about these girls who were making themselves sick.
[01:27:59] And there was three or four girls
[01:28:01] that he did this report on.
[01:28:03] And after that, the number of cases
[01:28:07] went completely through the roof.
[01:28:10] Same thing with cutting.
[01:28:13] Like this happens with young females a lot.
[01:28:16] They cut themselves,
[01:28:17] but it'll spread through a community,
[01:28:20] through a friendship group of girls.
[01:28:22] Happens with suicide.
[01:28:24] You know, there's this thing where,
[01:28:25] and this always scares me because,
[01:28:27] you know, doing a podcast like what we're doing today
[01:28:29] and a lot of people are gonna listen to this.
[01:28:31] When they put up anti-suicide
[01:28:35] or suicide help hotline numbers in a community,
[01:28:38] oftentimes the suicide rate increases
[01:28:41] because now it's putting it in their mind.
[01:28:43] How much do you,
[01:28:44] how much have you all seen of that in the last,
[01:28:47] you know, 10 years?
[01:28:48] And I guess it's maybe even less than that,
[01:28:50] seven years of where people are so connected
[01:28:54] to social media where, oh, you know what,
[01:28:57] Billy's depressed and he seems like he's getting
[01:28:59] a lot of attention for being depressed.
[01:29:01] And I kind of, you know,
[01:29:03] I didn't have anything to do on Friday night.
[01:29:05] And so I'm probably not that popular.
[01:29:07] I'm actually gonna be depressed too.
[01:29:09] How much is that impacting people?
[01:29:11] Because let's face it, you know, 100 years ago,
[01:29:15] people weren't talking about this.
[01:29:16] And so what were they doing?
[01:29:18] You know, like, oh, I'm depressed,
[01:29:19] but that's just the way I feel.
[01:29:20] And they didn't even have a name for it.
[01:29:21] So guess what they did?
[01:29:22] They went to work and they carried on
[01:29:23] and maybe they didn't feel great, but they carried on.
[01:29:26] What role is this total connectedness that we have
[01:29:31] and you know, we all can't even compare
[01:29:34] to the 15 year olds that are connected
[01:29:39] like 100% of the time that they're awake,
[01:29:42] they're connecting and being influenced
[01:29:44] by everyone else in the world.
[01:29:47] What impact have you all seen from that?
[01:29:52] It's substantial.
[01:29:54] And I think it is with the onset.
[01:29:56] In fact, I think it around like when smartphones happened.
[01:30:00] Oh yeah.
[01:30:00] That's where I kind of, like the internet was already there.
[01:30:02] You could go online and look at a bunch of stuff,
[01:30:04] but at your fingertips.
[01:30:06] And now with, you know, Instagram and all the things,
[01:30:08] I mean, you're just constantly looking,
[01:30:10] who's doing what, who's saying what,
[01:30:12] who's endorsing what, who's against what
[01:30:14] and the attachment to all of that.
[01:30:17] And also the social disconnect,
[01:30:20] like from other human beings versus,
[01:30:23] instead of having a conversation with you
[01:30:25] or asking you your opinion about something
[01:30:27] or going to you to talk about something
[01:30:29] that might be on my mind,
[01:30:30] I'm looking to see who's saying what
[01:30:32] and what are other people doing about it.
[01:30:34] Which is influencing my feed
[01:30:36] and all the things that are coming out
[01:30:37] of the algorithm.
[01:30:38] Like how many, like I didn't get as many likes as you got.
[01:30:41] What does that mean about me?
[01:30:44] In addition to what you were saying earlier
[01:30:46] about like the self-diagnosing.
[01:30:48] Oh, I read it, you know, how many times,
[01:30:50] especially with the adolescents I see.
[01:30:52] Oh, I read an article, I think I have OCD in my mind.
[01:30:54] Like, you don't, let's talk about that.
[01:30:57] Or, oh, I read an article and this is happening to me.
[01:30:59] So I think I might have stomach cancer.
[01:31:03] It's, we'll send you to the doctor
[01:31:05] if you want to have that checked out.
[01:31:06] But let's talk about your,
[01:31:07] that you woke up with a stomach ache.
[01:31:09] Because you have a job interview this afternoon
[01:31:11] that you kind of don't want to go to.
[01:31:14] Let's talk about that instead.
[01:31:16] But no, I looked online, I looked online.
[01:31:17] If you wake up with a stomach ache, it means this.
[01:31:19] Right, so this, whether it's looking up symptoms
[01:31:23] and diagnoses or what this means
[01:31:24] or what other people are doing
[01:31:26] or what other people are saying about
[01:31:27] what other people are doing.
[01:31:29] It's just, it's like it's defined.
[01:31:32] Right, self-diagnosis becomes self-fulfilling prophecy as well.
[01:31:37] Well, and the persons, you know what they're,
[01:31:39] they're out their world outside of social media
[01:31:41] looks like their family, how much they can, you know,
[01:31:43] cross-reference the things that they're seeing on there
[01:31:45] with like a parent who's telling them like,
[01:31:47] let's think about that, let's walk that through.
[01:31:49] Like if depending on how much exposure they have to that,
[01:31:52] outside of that world is gonna make a big difference
[01:31:55] in terms of the impact of being engrossed
[01:31:57] in the social media world.
[01:31:59] Because not all kiddos have a family
[01:32:02] who's willing to talk them through all the things
[01:32:03] that they're seeing on social media,
[01:32:05] help them discern what they read, these sorts of things.
[01:32:07] So definitely a balance outside of that
[01:32:10] is necessary to combat the influence within social media.
[01:32:14] Well, then there's also the part of having things
[01:32:17] just available, right, right now, right now is,
[01:32:20] like I think about when I went growing up,
[01:32:22] like there were no, there were,
[01:32:24] I didn't even, we didn't have an answering machine.
[01:32:26] Like if you wanted to call somebody, you called them
[01:32:28] and if they were there, they would pick up
[01:32:30] and if they weren't, they didn't.
[01:32:31] Like that was it.
[01:32:32] You called them back later.
[01:32:34] There was no texting, there was no this immediacy.
[01:32:38] So thinking about not having that immediate gratification,
[01:32:44] I and people in my generation and people who didn't have access
[01:32:48] to some of these things developed patience
[01:32:51] and tolerance skills.
[01:32:52] Like I could wait, even if I really, really, really
[01:32:54] wanna talk to you.
[01:32:56] Like I can wait and not fall apart.
[01:32:59] I had a client, well, I still see her,
[01:33:01] but when she was younger, her parents are fantastic.
[01:33:05] She is like, the very self-diagnose,
[01:33:08] has no tolerance for delayed gratification or patience
[01:33:13] because everything, right?
[01:33:14] Everything is an immediate answer.
[01:33:15] If I text you and you have not, if I see the dots
[01:33:18] and then you don't get back to me,
[01:33:20] like this kind of thing.
[01:33:22] So she did something and got herself in trouble.
[01:33:25] So her parents took her phone.
[01:33:27] She said, if you take my phone,
[01:33:28] I'm gonna kill myself.
[01:33:30] I can't not have my phone.
[01:33:32] They put her in the car and took her to the emergency room.
[01:33:34] I thought that was the most brilliant thing ever.
[01:33:36] And of course, by the time they walk in,
[01:33:38] she's like, nevermind, I won't kill myself.
[01:33:39] I'll get my phone back whenever you wanna give it to me.
[01:33:43] But it was that instant, like I can't live.
[01:33:46] Like I cannot not have my phone.
[01:33:48] And she has no emotional, like at the time,
[01:33:52] like no emotional management skills.
[01:33:55] How old?
[01:33:56] She was probably 15 or 16 at this point, like old enough.
[01:34:00] But I think about all the parents that would be like,
[01:34:02] oh my, okay, nevermind.
[01:34:04] Yeah.
[01:34:05] Right?
[01:34:06] And so now you just reinforced that if you're upset
[01:34:09] or you don't think you can handle something,
[01:34:11] just I'll make it easy for you so that
[01:34:16] a delay of gratification, managing anxiety,
[01:34:19] tolerating, waiting, and then what do you do?
[01:34:22] Like if I wanna talk to you
[01:34:24] and you're not answering the phone,
[01:34:27] I'm not gonna just like sit there.
[01:34:28] Like right now people sit there,
[01:34:29] or they sit on their phone,
[01:34:31] versus like you go do something to manage your anxiety
[01:34:34] or your distress at not being able to talk to your person.
[01:34:37] Like we, like I grew up with that.
[01:34:40] People nowadays, they're in a lot of ways are lacking
[01:34:45] in those skills of just managing their feelings
[01:34:47] because they don't have to.
[01:34:48] Have you heard the expression left on red?
[01:34:51] Have you ever heard of this?
[01:34:52] Yes.
[01:34:52] So it's when, yeah.
[01:34:53] My kids talk about that.
[01:34:54] So it's when you're,
[01:34:57] I send you a message, Karlyn,
[01:34:59] and I get a thing that says you read it,
[01:35:02] but you don't respond to me.
[01:35:03] So you just left me on, you read it,
[01:35:05] but you don't respond to me.
[01:35:06] Oh my God.
[01:35:07] It's devastating.
[01:35:08] I've heard about it.
[01:35:08] It's catastrophic.
[01:35:09] Yeah, it's a great thing.
[01:35:10] For one, to not get an immediate response
[01:35:12] and then to be left on red is like,
[01:35:13] you might as well have been canceled,
[01:35:14] is the other term.
[01:35:16] So this stuff is gonna impact people.
[01:35:19] I mean, that's an impact psychologically.
[01:35:21] Yes, huge.
[01:35:22] Because we're just expecting everyone
[01:35:24] to maintain connection all the time.
[01:35:27] And soothes me.
[01:35:27] When I'm upset, you need to reply.
[01:35:30] So I don't have anxious feelings.
[01:35:32] And the social media companies
[01:35:34] are creating these things.
[01:35:36] Like TikTok is created to be as addictive
[01:35:38] as possible, as humanly possible.
[01:35:40] So it's immediate gratification 100% of the time.
[01:35:42] It's just like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:35:44] And you can't put that thing down.
[01:35:47] This is a nightmare, isn't it?
[01:35:49] Well, and if you see it show up a lot
[01:35:50] in folks coming into work, younger ages
[01:35:52] between 20 to 24, and you refer to a lot
[01:35:56] as like being entitled, right?
[01:35:57] You hear this term entitlement thrown a lot.
[01:35:59] Like this generation is entitled entitlement and such.
[01:36:02] But when you really look at what's going on,
[01:36:05] there's very poor distress tolerance skills.
[01:36:07] Like if there's something I need to wait on
[01:36:09] or I'm waiting for an answer from my manager
[01:36:12] for something or something needs to change.
[01:36:14] It clearly needs to grow in the organization.
[01:36:16] But it's taking some time to work through these things.
[01:36:19] Like there's an immediate sort of narrative
[01:36:22] that something must be wrong,
[01:36:23] that this is a really negative thing.
[01:36:24] People don't care about me or whatever that person goes
[01:36:27] through and their poor distress tolerance.
[01:36:28] And it creates all kinds of issues.
[01:36:30] And then if I can't tolerate it, what do I do?
[01:36:32] I just leave or I check out or stop caring
[01:36:34] about what I'm doing or I can justify misusing
[01:36:38] company resources or not really using my time.
[01:36:40] I mean, there's all kinds of interesting things
[01:36:42] that come from it, but at the core,
[01:36:44] at least I'm not an expert on this at all,
[01:36:46] but it's just some very poor distress tolerance.
[01:36:49] Watching my kids work through some of that stuff
[01:36:51] where if someone didn't reply to them,
[01:36:53] like it felt sort of catastrophic
[01:36:56] and helping them think through like,
[01:36:58] what could possibly be some other options
[01:37:00] as to why someone might not have responded.
[01:37:02] And usually a few days later, it's like,
[01:37:03] oh, it's everything, everything's cool, mom.
[01:37:05] Someone's got their phone taken away.
[01:37:07] So, oh, okay.
[01:37:08] So that's why they didn't respond to you.
[01:37:10] And your kids are freaking out.
[01:37:11] I'm thinking that's the end of the world.
[01:37:12] Something bad is happening for sure.
[01:37:14] Yeah.
[01:37:17] Can we talk through some mental health issues?
[01:37:18] I got, I read through a bunch of these.
[01:37:21] Anxiety disorder, fear and dread.
[01:37:27] What's a cause for that?
[01:37:33] And there's so many potential causes for that.
[01:37:36] But I mean, ultimately it's a state in which you're sort of
[01:37:41] assuming or maybe anticipating
[01:37:44] that something very negative is going to happen, right?
[01:37:47] I have this, I will just use a job interview coming up
[01:37:51] and I really need this job,
[01:37:53] but I'm definitely gonna say something wrong
[01:37:55] and I'm gonna trip out.
[01:37:55] I mean, it's just can sort of roll in that direction
[01:37:59] with a person's thoughts in a lot of ways.
[01:38:01] And then in their body can feel sick,
[01:38:04] sick to my stomach, look like somatic symptoms.
[01:38:06] So people express it in a lot of different ways.
[01:38:08] Some you'll see a lot of thoughts related to it
[01:38:10] that are very sort of negative
[01:38:12] and anticipating something sort of horrible
[01:38:14] is going to happen or not work out well.
[01:38:16] And in some ways for some people it's very physical.
[01:38:18] They're sick all the time,
[01:38:20] we're often getting a cold or these sorts of things.
[01:38:23] So.
[01:38:24] And it's like a chain.
[01:38:25] So job interview, right?
[01:38:28] Well, I don't know, what if I say the wrong thing?
[01:38:29] What if they ask me a question and I don't know?
[01:38:31] Well, what if they don't like me?
[01:38:32] What if I don't get the job?
[01:38:33] What if it's that kind of chaining together?
[01:38:36] So next thing, I might as well just not even,
[01:38:39] I might as well kill myself.
[01:38:41] I mean, it can go in a lot of different ways,
[01:38:44] but this like persistent worry and anticipation
[01:38:51] that is not proportionate to the situation.
[01:38:56] Like it's one thing to have some nervousness.
[01:38:59] I have this big job interview, I really want this job.
[01:39:02] I hope they like me, I'm a little bit,
[01:39:04] my stomach hurts a little bit.
[01:39:05] That's one thing, but that disproportion
[01:39:08] and that chaining together of all of the things
[01:39:11] that could potentially happen.
[01:39:13] So go ahead.
[01:39:14] I was just saying, it's like the difference too between,
[01:39:15] I think most of us experience some level of anxiety
[01:39:18] around things that can actually be really helpful, right?
[01:39:19] Help me to prepare for something.
[01:39:21] But when it gets to the aspect of sort of clinically
[01:39:23] significant, it's interfering in such a way that now,
[01:39:25] I just called out of my job interview
[01:39:27] or I'm choosing not to go or I couldn't,
[01:39:30] I could even bring myself to study
[01:39:32] because I was so anxious about the potential exam
[01:39:34] and so it becomes almost self-sabotaging in some ways
[01:39:39] as we move towards like a clinically significant version
[01:39:41] of that.
[01:39:42] So what is treatment like for someone that's in that zone?
[01:39:46] I haven't been out of my house.
[01:39:47] I didn't get the job, I didn't do go to the job interview.
[01:39:49] I actually haven't even applied for any jobs.
[01:39:51] I'm just getting by on whatever savings I had
[01:39:56] and maybe starting to get some welfare checks
[01:39:58] because I'm just freaked out because,
[01:40:00] so what are you saying to me?
[01:40:02] How do we talk someone through that?
[01:40:06] Well, I mean, a lot of it has to do with,
[01:40:09] well, I know we were talking about this before recording
[01:40:11] that when somebody is that kind of agitated
[01:40:15] and in distress, the front part of your brain,
[01:40:19] the prefrontal cortex, which is the part we use
[01:40:21] for like weighing pros and cons and anticipating outcomes
[01:40:25] and kind of making decisions and thinking things through
[01:40:30] is almost like not available.
[01:40:32] It's almost offline.
[01:40:33] You can think about it like it got knocked offline
[01:40:34] because my nervous system is a wreck.
[01:40:36] So the person really can't make really good decisions
[01:40:40] when they're that kind of escalated.
[01:40:44] So treatment will like undoubtedly, no matter what,
[01:40:47] include helping a person learn skills and techniques
[01:40:51] to like calm their, like literally calm
[01:40:54] their physical body down.
[01:40:56] It doesn't, I always tell people,
[01:40:57] you don't have to be calm.
[01:40:58] That would be lovely, but you don't have to be calm.
[01:41:00] You just have to be calm enough for your brain.
[01:41:03] What are some techniques you're gonna teach somebody?
[01:41:06] It could be like deep breathing techniques,
[01:41:08] meditation, grounding, physical activity
[01:41:12] is really, really helpful for a dysregulated body,
[01:41:15] like walking, running, jumping, swimming, yoga, plot,
[01:41:20] whatever, physical activity,
[01:41:21] because it's a physical manifestation of the anxiety.
[01:41:25] So you gotta get the body to be able to relax enough
[01:41:29] for the brain to come online.
[01:41:31] So now once the brain is more available,
[01:41:33] now we gotta go through all that cognitive distortion,
[01:41:37] this idea that like, if you don't get this job,
[01:41:39] you're a horrible person.
[01:41:40] Like let's talk about how realistic that is.
[01:41:43] Or if you don't get this job,
[01:41:45] it means that you're never gonna get a job
[01:41:47] for the rest of your life.
[01:41:48] Well, let's look at that.
[01:41:49] So cognitive behavioral therapy,
[01:41:51] cognitive techniques will address some of those
[01:41:56] really kind of extreme escalated thoughts.
[01:41:59] So you need both.
[01:42:00] I mean, most mental health and illness issues
[01:42:03] are gonna require both,
[01:42:05] but for anxiety, you really need both,
[01:42:07] the physical and the cognitive.
[01:42:11] As I was reading through this,
[01:42:12] I ended up with these personality disorders
[01:42:14] coming into these different categories.
[01:42:17] Cluster A, Cluster B, and Cluster C.
[01:42:20] Cluster A is just, they had some subtitles here.
[01:42:23] Cluster A was odd.
[01:42:25] Yep, odd.
[01:42:26] Cluster B was dramatic, and Cluster C was anxious.
[01:42:30] And I was like, well, you could kind of like
[01:42:32] the stereotypical categories of people,
[01:42:35] you know, that guy's weird, right?
[01:42:36] That guy's an odd guy.
[01:42:38] Someone that's paranoid.
[01:42:40] Paranoid is one of the things in Cluster A, odd.
[01:42:42] Paranoid always on guard.
[01:42:44] Believe people are trying to harm them.
[01:42:47] Skitsoid, which I didn't really know the definition of,
[01:42:51] skitsoid is people that avoid people and relationships.
[01:42:55] So tell me about paranoid.
[01:42:57] Well, give me a case.
[01:42:58] Let me read you to find out.
[01:42:59] Let me hear a case.
[01:43:00] I wanna hear some case studies of paranoid.
[01:43:02] So funny.
[01:43:03] You know, the black helicopters are out there flying around.
[01:43:07] Well, you said earlier actually about like a person
[01:43:10] who might already be a little bit,
[01:43:12] save me, predisposed to like conspiracy, right?
[01:43:15] So with personality disorders, it's not,
[01:43:20] it's more like a part of your,
[01:43:21] like I can be a shy person,
[01:43:22] which means I'm probably gonna be shy like across the board,
[01:43:25] right, not just in one or two situations.
[01:43:27] So with personality disorders, it's one of those like,
[01:43:30] kind of in most situations you're gonna see.
[01:43:32] So paranoid, it might be not the helicopters are chasing me.
[01:43:36] That's probably you're more in the psychotic,
[01:43:40] psychosis realm there.
[01:43:42] Personality disorders might be just kind of
[01:43:44] a general paranoia like,
[01:43:46] well, you know, every time I go to work,
[01:43:49] I say hi to the girl at the desk and she says,
[01:43:51] and say hi to me, I think she doesn't like me.
[01:43:52] She probably, XYZ, like a leaning or a disposition
[01:43:58] to thinking people don't like me.
[01:44:00] I think people are watching me.
[01:44:02] I think somebody went into my locker
[01:44:03] and took something out, I think.
[01:44:06] I found it at home later that night.
[01:44:07] Like my predisposition is paranoid versus psychosis,
[01:44:13] which is gonna be the helicopters are chasing me
[01:44:15] and the lights are secretly filming me.
[01:44:18] The, I mentioned that thing earlier where I said,
[01:44:22] I told people on my training course, like,
[01:44:24] hey, we're all insane.
[01:44:25] We're all some level of insane
[01:44:26] because reality was different.
[01:44:27] These things are the same too.
[01:44:28] Like everyone's got some level of paranoia
[01:44:31] and you can see it come out of people.
[01:44:32] You know, got that person, I work with leaders a lot
[01:44:35] and you know, a leader that might be like,
[01:44:37] well, I'm never gonna get promoted.
[01:44:38] Oh, why is that?
[01:44:39] Oh, they don't like me.
[01:44:40] Like it's just a level of paranoia.
[01:44:42] That's, and you choose it
[01:44:44] because well, actually you're not getting promoted
[01:44:45] because you failed on your last two projects.
[01:44:48] Has nothing to do with them not liking you.
[01:44:50] You're not performing well.
[01:44:51] But of course for them, it's they don't like me.
[01:44:53] Why don't they like you?
[01:44:54] Well, because I used to work at this other company
[01:44:56] and that guy worked there and they don't like that guy.
[01:44:59] And so therefore they don't like me.
[01:45:00] So like all these things and anxiety, you know, right?
[01:45:03] We talk about, you just mentioned Megan's like,
[01:45:06] a certain level of anxiety is good.
[01:45:07] So it's okay.
[01:45:08] Hey, I'm nervous about this job interview
[01:45:10] because I really wanna get the job.
[01:45:11] So I'm there for research the company.
[01:45:12] I'm gonna be prepared.
[01:45:13] Well, I'm gonna go over some notes.
[01:45:14] I'm gonna be ready.
[01:45:15] That's cool.
[01:45:16] That's great.
[01:45:17] So everyone has some level of these things going on.
[01:45:21] It's just when we start to let them spiral
[01:45:24] and get out of control, that's when we have problems.
[01:45:27] So cluster A were acting a little strange,
[01:45:32] cluster B dramatic, which is this also known
[01:45:37] as teenage years a little bit?
[01:45:40] Oftentimes with some of that, you'll find, you know,
[01:45:42] some form of an attachment disruption
[01:45:44] or something happening during that time period
[01:45:46] that leads to some of this in more adult life
[01:45:49] where we're looking at like a pattern
[01:45:50] of unstable relationships or sort of this real
[01:45:54] or imagined fear of abandonment that leads me
[01:45:57] to sort of be dramatic if that's what you,
[01:45:59] the word you wanna use in relationships
[01:46:01] and such in response to a perception
[01:46:04] that I might be losing you a lot of push, pull,
[01:46:06] these sorts of things.
[01:46:07] But I think we can find often in this group
[01:46:09] that there's some something that happened
[01:46:11] in the attachment that led to this disposition for.
[01:46:14] What kind of thing is happening?
[01:46:16] I mean, it can be a wide variety of things.
[01:46:18] It can be various levels of abuse, sexual abuse,
[01:46:21] physical abuse could be a very misattuned parent
[01:46:24] or maybe not having somebody who could reflect back
[01:46:27] to you at a young age, mirroring sort of like,
[01:46:29] you know, I feel sad or I feel afraid.
[01:46:32] It's sort of normal to feel that way
[01:46:34] instead of like don't feel that way
[01:46:35] or there's something wrong with you for feeling that way.
[01:46:37] And I start to build these beliefs
[01:46:39] where I sort of lose touch with my map
[01:46:42] for like an appropriate emotional response
[01:46:45] to what's happening.
[01:46:47] You can kind of find that disruption.
[01:46:48] And sometimes with when you're looking
[01:46:50] at a personality disorder, something has been so severe
[01:46:53] that now it is part of the personality in some ways.
[01:46:56] And so you can shape it and kind of lose some things
[01:46:59] with the volume of it, but that disposition
[01:47:01] might always be there to be sort of like,
[01:47:04] you know, someone, my friend canceled dinner on me again.
[01:47:08] They must really not like me
[01:47:09] or must not be important to them as opposed to like,
[01:47:11] maybe there's something else going on for them
[01:47:13] as to why they canceled dinner.
[01:47:16] But it really does feel that traumatic to the person.
[01:47:20] And I think that's a really important part of working
[01:47:22] with someone with a personality disorder
[01:47:23] is recognizing that while it might look sort of irrational
[01:47:27] and you're like, what's going on for them,
[01:47:28] it feels very real.
[01:47:29] So this piece of like, how do I calm down the body enough
[01:47:33] to bring the brain online to be able to just consider
[01:47:37] what else might be possible is a super important part
[01:47:40] of helping somebody through that.
[01:47:42] And you can see with time,
[01:47:44] with like an appropriate level of support
[01:47:45] and period of time and multiple reparative experiences
[01:47:48] and relationships where the thing that I feared
[01:47:51] didn't actually happen that some of this
[01:47:53] can calm down a little bit.
[01:47:55] You'll see, especially in what's considered cluster B,
[01:48:01] people who have been adopted,
[01:48:05] given up for adoption early on,
[01:48:07] or in a way that was left them for some period of time
[01:48:11] without kind of a secure, like a parent
[01:48:14] or authority attachment.
[01:48:15] Clients who, like one client who is,
[01:48:21] she's the definition of that was neglected,
[01:48:25] like severely neglected when she was a child.
[01:48:28] So this anxiety of like being left or not being wanted
[01:48:34] or being, like picking somebody other than her,
[01:48:39] like this felt sense of rejection is so profound.
[01:48:42] It almost, it's like her lenses.
[01:48:44] It just, it's like her experience in the world
[01:48:48] with other people is always through this lens of like,
[01:48:51] do you like me?
[01:48:52] Are you gonna pick me?
[01:48:55] Like, am I safe?
[01:48:57] Can I rely on you?
[01:48:58] Can I trust you?
[01:48:59] So these are, that can be rough.
[01:49:01] Is this, one of these things was called
[01:49:03] histrionic, histrionic personality disorder,
[01:49:05] which in one of the categories in there
[01:49:07] was desire to be noticed.
[01:49:10] This is a similar thing where I just want people
[01:49:12] to see that I'm here.
[01:49:13] Well, and you know what I would say,
[01:49:14] I say this a lot clinically too,
[01:49:16] is this idea that like, oh, the person,
[01:49:18] she's like seeking attention.
[01:49:19] She's attention seeking.
[01:49:20] That's very common, right?
[01:49:21] Term that's used.
[01:49:23] And, but often used in like a judgmental,
[01:49:27] judgmental, derogatory way.
[01:49:29] I would say like, oh, they're absolutely seeking attention,
[01:49:32] but not because they're just being like,
[01:49:34] you know, irritating.
[01:49:36] It's something is going on for this person internally
[01:49:38] that they like literally need you to stop
[01:49:41] and like pay attention to me.
[01:49:43] So I can, something inside of me settles down.
[01:49:47] Now this is a huge dysregulation, right?
[01:49:49] So this is where in terms of therapy and treatment comes in
[01:49:52] as helping people learn how to regulate their body
[01:49:55] and like calm some of that agitation down
[01:49:58] and then do all the cognitive work of helping like,
[01:50:02] reality check, like right, kind of sort through some
[01:50:05] of these big extreme thoughts that I have to be like,
[01:50:07] are they really that realistic?
[01:50:09] And then like you have said a couple times,
[01:50:11] Megan, the reparative experiences, like,
[01:50:14] you know, how many times did you think,
[01:50:16] like I have a client who for the longest time,
[01:50:18] she would show up like 15, 20 minutes early to her session
[01:50:23] because she had this idea that what if she's not out there
[01:50:27] at the time of our session and I forget we had a session
[01:50:30] and I leave, which first of all, it would never,
[01:50:32] ever happen in a million years ever.
[01:50:35] But like this was the one who grew up with a lot of neglect,
[01:50:38] grew up with parents saying, oh yeah,
[01:50:40] I'll be home in a few hours and they didn't come home
[01:50:43] or they forgot about her, right?
[01:50:46] So you can see where like the early stuff shaped this,
[01:50:49] but a lot of our work was, it wasn't just like saying,
[01:50:53] hey, we've had 72 sessions and I've been here every time,
[01:50:56] like, isn't that enough?
[01:50:58] That wasn't enough for her.
[01:50:59] Like she needed to really go through the experience
[01:51:02] of not relying on me to be there on time
[01:51:05] so that she felt better.
[01:51:06] She had to learn how to do that for herself.
[01:51:08] It's that external scaffolding versus the internal.
[01:51:11] And was she able to?
[01:51:12] Yeah, totally.
[01:51:13] I still see her.
[01:51:14] She's great.
[01:51:15] You still see her, but she,
[01:51:16] but it's more like just checking in.
[01:51:18] Yeah, and it's more like maintenance.
[01:51:19] I see her once or twice a month.
[01:51:21] I used to see her two, three times a week
[01:51:23] because the level of distress and interference
[01:51:26] in her life, like she couldn't work,
[01:51:28] her relationships were a mess.
[01:51:30] She was on all these medication.
[01:51:32] I mean, she had a really, really messy life
[01:51:35] because this is how she lived it.
[01:51:36] This is how she approached almost every relationship
[01:51:39] she had in her world.
[01:51:41] So now like she's working, she's got kids,
[01:51:43] she's just got back from like,
[01:51:46] Bali or something, I don't know,
[01:51:47] she went with her husband, like her life is great.
[01:51:49] Some things are good.
[01:51:50] So it's a little, it's a little maintenance,
[01:51:52] like kind of maintenance, car maintenance.
[01:51:55] She's getting her, her chin ups, everyone's gone.
[01:51:58] Yeah, it's weird.
[01:51:59] Cause all these things are, everyone listening
[01:52:02] can be like, oh yeah, I,
[01:52:03] I have a little bit of that.
[01:52:04] I have a little bit of that.
[01:52:05] I have a little bit of that.
[01:52:06] I have a little bit of this.
[01:52:06] Well, another one in this category was narcissistic,
[01:52:11] which, you know, when, when we work with leaders,
[01:52:14] you know, a lot of times people that end up
[01:52:15] in leadership positions,
[01:52:16] they end up in leadership positions oftentimes
[01:52:18] because they were stepping up and they thought
[01:52:20] they could do the job.
[01:52:21] And if you can think you can do the job,
[01:52:22] that means you got a little bit of ego working.
[01:52:24] And if you got a little bit of ego working,
[01:52:26] sometimes that ego can start to expand
[01:52:28] beyond your own control and you end up sometimes
[01:52:31] with people that are narcissistic.
[01:52:33] And what does that look like from like a clinical perspective?
[01:52:39] I mean, I think when you,
[01:52:40] you talk about this from like a clinical
[01:52:42] where you're ending up in treatment,
[01:52:43] it, it, it moves into a place where you have,
[01:52:47] you lose sight of, I don't know if empathy is the right word
[01:52:50] or like my impact on other people.
[01:52:52] Like my focus becomes so much on like where I'm at,
[01:52:55] my, my, my vision, whatever I have going on.
[01:52:58] And somehow along the way I lost sight of like
[01:53:00] what I do impacts other people and like my behavior
[01:53:03] has an impact on other people.
[01:53:05] And so that's on the very severe end.
[01:53:06] And I think when you're looking at the actual disorder itself
[01:53:08] that word is thrown around a lot.
[01:53:10] For sure.
[01:53:12] But where we've seen it often really looks like
[01:53:15] this person has becomes significantly self-focused
[01:53:20] and really lose sight of how their behavior
[01:53:22] impacts other people.
[01:53:24] And they just don't care about anybody else.
[01:53:25] It would appear that way.
[01:53:27] I mean, I think what's really happening so much
[01:53:29] is that there's the, the, the ego cannot tolerate
[01:53:33] any sort of feedback that would suggest like, wow,
[01:53:36] I might have hurt someone when I did that.
[01:53:39] Like it, it's just so vulnerable.
[01:53:41] Like it's actually this person, while they might appear
[01:53:43] like it doesn't matter to them, they're actually so sensitive
[01:53:46] and vulnerable that they've built up so many defenses
[01:53:48] in their psyche to not allow for any sort of feedback
[01:53:51] to crack through an idea of like, oh, in fact,
[01:53:53] I could potentially fail.
[01:53:55] Or in fact, like I could, I do have the potential
[01:53:58] to hurt someone.
[01:53:59] It's like, become so distorted in a way
[01:54:01] that they, they can't even see that as a possibility.
[01:54:04] And so then I come across in my behaviors
[01:54:06] in such as very disregarding of others.
[01:54:09] These, a person with a narcissist personality
[01:54:12] is very easily wounded with your words.
[01:54:14] They're not the person that you can give that sort of direct
[01:54:18] feedback to.
[01:54:18] They're so wounded that almost catastrophic
[01:54:21] to the relationship sometimes to be able to give feedback.
[01:54:24] And what you will see as opposed to some of the other
[01:54:28] personalities, like the histrionic borderline
[01:54:32] and they're easily, easily wounded with words,
[01:54:35] very, very sensitive, but you're gonna see somebody
[01:54:37] kind of melt down and cry.
[01:54:39] And oh my gosh, I can't believe you said that to me.
[01:54:41] You know, like kind of collapse a little bit
[01:54:45] with narcissism.
[01:54:46] Lash out.
[01:54:47] Lash out and like cut you off, out, gone.
[01:54:50] Like can, just cannot tolerate.
[01:54:52] Like kind of being challenged.
[01:54:55] Yeah.
[01:54:56] Cluster C, which is, which is anxious.
[01:54:59] This is when you get in the OCD, the obsessive compulsive.
[01:55:03] Let me hear a wild OCD story.
[01:55:05] Oh boy.
[01:55:06] Let's see.
[01:55:07] I don't know if I have a good one to go.
[01:55:12] Well, I, I mean several.
[01:55:15] And I think like we said before, there's,
[01:55:18] people can have like kind of traits and like
[01:55:20] the leanings and inclinations.
[01:55:22] And that's one thing versus it being at a,
[01:55:26] like a clinic clinically significant level
[01:55:28] where you're like your life,
[01:55:29] like you're having a hard time living your life.
[01:55:31] So somebody who's a little bit more extreme might be,
[01:55:38] like OCD might be, say germs, right?
[01:55:40] So they don't, I don't want to touch doorknobs, shake hands,
[01:55:44] use public restrooms.
[01:55:47] How they fare during COVID?
[01:55:49] They loved it.
[01:55:51] Oh, cause they just like, oh.
[01:55:52] Social distancing, I don't have to touch anybody.
[01:55:54] And you have to wear a mask in front of me.
[01:55:57] Sure.
[01:55:57] Yeah.
[01:55:58] Love.
[01:55:59] They were stoked.
[01:56:00] Those are the ones that are going to have a lot harder time,
[01:56:03] socially engaging, taking risks, right?
[01:56:07] Like the idea of like, well, the only restroom here
[01:56:10] is a public room and you gotta go in there or hold it.
[01:56:14] Like, you know, that's going to be very distressing
[01:56:16] for somebody that leans a little bit more.
[01:56:19] Towards obsessions and compulsions.
[01:56:23] What do COVID look like?
[01:56:27] Cause I've done a couple of podcasts about deaths of despair
[01:56:30] during COVID.
[01:56:31] It's a nightmare from your professional perspective.
[01:56:36] How bad was it?
[01:56:37] Oh my gosh.
[01:56:38] I mean, it was significant because I mean, already,
[01:56:41] especially when you're working with very complex psychiatric
[01:56:43] disorders, resources and like access to hospitals and such
[01:56:46] is always sort of an issue for our folks.
[01:56:49] Because, you know, there is certain criteria related to being
[01:56:53] able to get hospital support.
[01:56:54] Somebody has to be very sort of significantly regressed to be
[01:56:58] able to get hospital support if they need that.
[01:57:00] And there oftentimes isn't that level of care that allows for
[01:57:03] that like sort of least restrictive setting in order to
[01:57:06] be able to support them outside of the hospital.
[01:57:09] So that means that in order for me to go and get help,
[01:57:12] I needed to be in really bad shape,
[01:57:14] which means I'm in really bad shape.
[01:57:16] Well, and that's in general for folks with mental health
[01:57:19] and mental health problems.
[01:57:20] You need to be a danger to yourself or others and meet
[01:57:22] criteria like significantly be a danger to yourself or others
[01:57:24] to be able to get that, you know,
[01:57:25] kind of inpatient hospitalization unless you're willing
[01:57:28] to go on your own, which oftentimes when someone is
[01:57:29] in that state they might not be.
[01:57:32] So then with COVID, obviously access to resources and beds
[01:57:35] became significantly less than you have a significant more
[01:57:38] isolation, which is a huge risk factor for our folks.
[01:57:41] Isolation undoubtedly will increase, you know,
[01:57:45] symptoms of psychosis, depression, anxiety,
[01:57:48] you know, when I go inside my head and I have this internal
[01:57:50] side of isolation, a lot can happen.
[01:57:52] And so just being in contact with other people,
[01:57:54] making eye contact with you, these things,
[01:57:56] they're like grounding to the person.
[01:57:57] So all of that is impacted.
[01:57:59] And then how we had to do therapy shifted significantly.
[01:58:02] I mean, we moved from a residential setting where we're
[01:58:04] seeing people in person, we're going to outings together,
[01:58:06] we're meeting in groups together to like,
[01:58:08] now I'm doing over the computer with you with somebody who
[01:58:12] may have some significant psychosis around computer use.
[01:58:14] So they're not even going to get on the camera with you.
[01:58:17] So it just really impacted our ability to provide care
[01:58:20] during that time.
[01:58:20] And people responded, I think, you know,
[01:58:23] I can't speak for all settings, but, you know,
[01:58:26] as best as they could during that time to be able to provide
[01:58:28] services and such and maintain the level of services
[01:58:31] that people needed.
[01:58:33] It was definitely a really difficult time.
[01:58:37] And, you know, telehealth is a super great option.
[01:58:39] It's not the best option for every client, you know,
[01:58:43] that in person is so important.
[01:58:46] And a lot of times for our folks, because a lot of talk therapy
[01:58:49] is very cognitive.
[01:58:50] And if you're working with someone with a cognitive disorder
[01:58:52] or a thought disorder, you know, oftentimes your sessions
[01:58:54] look like going for a walk or baking a pie together
[01:58:59] or like something of that nature that really we couldn't do
[01:59:02] so much during that time.
[01:59:03] Or if we did, it was, you know, an increased risk
[01:59:06] to the person and their health, especially during the time
[01:59:08] of COVID where we didn't really know too much about, right,
[01:59:10] what was happening and all these regulations came in.
[01:59:12] And like, you had to have all this distance
[01:59:14] that couldn't do these things.
[01:59:17] It impacted a lot.
[01:59:20] And I think also seeing, especially for people who are,
[01:59:26] seemed like in that age range, like maybe middle school going
[01:59:29] into high school, like right somewhere in there
[01:59:32] where a lot of social things are happening.
[01:59:34] Like your life is kind of socially driven,
[01:59:36] your friends, access to your friends,
[01:59:37] what everybody else is doing, you're growing up,
[01:59:40] maybe starting to think about college, things like that.
[01:59:42] Where there was this instant, you know, kind of a halt.
[01:59:45] And people were not going to school
[01:59:47] and having to do their classes online
[01:59:48] and not seeing their friends.
[01:59:50] So I saw a lot, especially in the younger population,
[01:59:54] almost like an arrested development of social development.
[01:59:59] So now, like, yeah, my clients who are 2021, 22,
[02:00:03] but you're talking to them and you're like, wow,
[02:00:04] you really sound like 16 or 17 years old right now.
[02:00:07] Like they kind of stalled out in the natural progression.
[02:00:11] I mean, my niece and my nephew,
[02:00:14] one was graduating college and one was graduating high school
[02:00:17] right when COVID happened, so like that May or whatever.
[02:00:20] So like, no graduations, no, you know,
[02:00:25] the pump in circumstance that comes with these milestones
[02:00:29] and rites of passage in life, they didn't have those.
[02:00:33] They seemed to fare okay, but I think about all the folks
[02:00:36] that like, well, what did that mean for their lives
[02:00:39] or the sense of missing out on something important
[02:00:43] and not having had the same opportunities.
[02:00:45] And I saw a lot of anxiety,
[02:00:47] a lot of anxiety, depression, isolation, fear,
[02:00:51] so much fear.
[02:00:52] I actually was on a podcast a couple of weeks ago
[02:00:54] where we were talking about how people,
[02:00:58] like remember when we were able,
[02:01:00] like going to the grocery store,
[02:01:01] like, you know, everyone's like head down
[02:01:03] and you're like not looking at anybody
[02:01:05] and don't get too close to a car.
[02:01:06] Stop making eye contact.
[02:01:07] Like it was very like weird.
[02:01:08] And this like that stayed.
[02:01:11] Like the people weren't like, oh, hey, how's it going?
[02:01:13] Nice to see you haven't seen me in a couple months
[02:01:14] and give you a hug.
[02:01:15] And some people were.
[02:01:16] I was like that for about three days.
[02:01:17] Yeah.
[02:01:18] And I'm like, I'm going to the store.
[02:01:20] Yeah, just get back to me.
[02:01:21] But it is still like that.
[02:01:22] I mean, some of that is still happening.
[02:01:24] So the fear, so when, again,
[02:01:26] going back to that nervous system thing, right?
[02:01:28] So if people's fear is up here
[02:01:30] and I'm constantly on alert and watching and waiting
[02:01:32] and who's wearing their mask and who isn't wearing your,
[02:01:35] not on the dot in the grocery store.
[02:01:37] Like people are not using their brains.
[02:01:40] Like they're not using the part of the brain
[02:01:42] that can be like, okay, it's chill.
[02:01:43] It's cool.
[02:01:44] We're fine.
[02:01:45] We're good.
[02:01:46] Cause you're keyed up all the time.
[02:01:47] I think that is still happening.
[02:01:48] We have not seen the end of the effect of that.
[02:01:50] Well, and those who had a propensity towards anxiety
[02:01:53] prior were struggling through some of that.
[02:01:55] I mean, significant more damage.
[02:01:57] And then you saw it happen when there was the decision
[02:01:59] of could we take the masks on or off
[02:02:01] and those who chose to keep it on
[02:02:02] and those who didn't, you know,
[02:02:03] it was very interesting when you would listen
[02:02:05] to folks perspective on that.
[02:02:06] But oftentimes it felt, especially for some
[02:02:09] of the younger kids, like protective
[02:02:10] to have that over the face in some ways.
[02:02:14] Very interesting impact.
[02:02:16] Man, that's crazy.
[02:02:19] What about addiction?
[02:02:21] And it's funny cause like you can get addicted
[02:02:24] to anything apparently, right?
[02:02:26] Like people get addicted to anything,
[02:02:27] but alcohol, opioids, cocaine, amphetamines,
[02:02:31] hallucinogens, PCP, like people, it's crazy.
[02:02:39] Anything in every, TikTok.
[02:02:40] TikTok.
[02:02:46] Let's jump to PTSD.
[02:02:48] So, you know, obviously in the veteran community,
[02:02:51] PTSD has been a huge news story
[02:02:55] and it's had a really big impact on, you know,
[02:02:58] on a lot of people. Sometimes I think, well,
[02:03:03] some people could actually use that kick
[02:03:06] in the ass that I talked about earlier.
[02:03:07] Like, hey dude, yeah, you saw some bad stuff,
[02:03:10] you lost some friends, but it's time to move on.
[02:03:14] And I think some people need that sort of direction.
[02:03:19] I mean, look, we've been going to wars
[02:03:21] since the beginning of mankind.
[02:03:22] I mean, and you know, you look at the other wars
[02:03:26] that we've been through in America, World War I,
[02:03:29] World War II, Korea, Vietnam,
[02:03:30] these were incredibly horrific wars, as all wars are.
[02:03:37] When you guys look at PTSD,
[02:03:41] what do you think from like a national perspective
[02:03:46] of where it's at, how it's being handled,
[02:03:50] do you think it's being handled the right way?
[02:03:52] What could we do better?
[02:03:53] I mean, you were out there freaking with a,
[02:03:57] in a fox hole with a pistol and a scorpion.
[02:03:59] You're scarred from that.
[02:04:03] I should write a book, that's the book title right there.
[02:04:05] I mean, I'm definitely not a public health expert.
[02:04:09] I don't have the national kind of response to some of this.
[02:04:12] I mean, what I'll say in my private practice,
[02:04:14] specifically to veterans is that whether sort of real
[02:04:19] or imagined, the military armed forces in general
[02:04:21] is doing a lot to try to address providing resources,
[02:04:25] early intervention, when traumatic events occur,
[02:04:29] having people on site who are trained
[02:04:31] to be able to help support.
[02:04:32] I mean, there's a lot that's happening.
[02:04:34] But stigma, the notion of stigma is still very present
[02:04:38] with regard to what it means to have mental health issues.
[02:04:41] And so I often have both active duty and veterans find me
[02:04:44] in my private practice, knowing that I was previous military,
[02:04:49] I think they feel a draw to me in that way
[02:04:50] in that history that I'm a safe person.
[02:04:52] Coming to me, because it doesn't, in that environment,
[02:04:57] feel safe just yet to be able to talk openly
[02:05:00] about what's going on for me.
[02:05:02] Because of, I mean, I think there's two really primary themes
[02:05:06] which look like privacy.
[02:05:08] Like will what I have to share stay private to me?
[02:05:11] Or if I talk about this, will my medical officer then know?
[02:05:14] And now my CO knows.
[02:05:15] And now if somebody's having a talk with me
[02:05:17] about something I shared, or this notion of retaliation
[02:05:22] in some ways, because somebody heard a story from somebody
[02:05:25] that they told someone they had depression,
[02:05:27] they were put on antidepressant, and now they took my wings,
[02:05:29] which is like my whole identity.
[02:05:31] So whether these things are actually happening,
[02:05:33] it's still very much so part of the culture or suggestion
[02:05:36] of like, is it safe to talk about these things?
[02:05:39] And so I think from that perspective,
[02:05:43] in terms of what we can do is it's
[02:05:45] amazing all of the resources that
[02:05:48] are being created and opportunities.
[02:05:49] I just recently read about like it's
[02:05:51] referred to as the sprint team.
[02:05:52] But it's essential.
[02:05:53] It's a special psychiatric unit as part of the armed forces
[02:05:56] where they come on site in response to like a trauma or something.
[02:05:59] It's very awesome.
[02:06:00] But engagement in the resources is still
[02:06:02] a really important factor, especially for veterans who
[02:06:05] disengage from like use of VHA services or anything
[02:06:08] like that.
[02:06:09] So like getting people to engage.
[02:06:11] And like, what we know about engagement in general
[02:06:14] is that like that initial response to someone's willingness,
[02:06:17] and we talked about this earlier, to disclose or talk
[02:06:20] about what's going on for them is critical,
[02:06:23] because it's going to shape whether or not
[02:06:24] they feel they can do that.
[02:06:27] And so I think engagement is huge,
[02:06:29] both in the active duty and veteran realm.
[02:06:31] And what we see with a lot of veterans
[02:06:33] and why they usually end up finding me in private practice,
[02:06:36] not part of their insurance or anything like that,
[02:06:38] is the privacy factor.
[02:06:39] But also, when you're separating from the military,
[02:06:44] part of your access to resources and disability
[02:06:47] and these sorts of things is directly connected
[02:06:49] to your service record, what was disclosed
[02:06:51] while you were in the military.
[02:06:52] And so if I'm in a culture, real or imagined, or in my mind,
[02:06:56] I feel like this is not a place where
[02:06:58] I can talk about these things.
[02:06:59] So I've chosen not to.
[02:07:00] I sort of white knuckle did.
[02:07:01] I've gotten through.
[02:07:02] I haven't shared a whole lot.
[02:07:03] Here I am as a veteran, looking towards trying
[02:07:06] to get some services or disability,
[02:07:08] or maybe now I'm realizing I'm no longer
[02:07:10] in the structure of that military environment.
[02:07:13] And so all this stuff is coming up for me
[02:07:15] that may be the structure of that environment sort of kept
[02:07:17] at bay.
[02:07:19] And I'm being told, well, there's nothing here
[02:07:21] to suggest in your record that anything significant happened
[02:07:24] to you.
[02:07:25] So you have to kind of convince me in some ways
[02:07:28] as to why you should get this disability percentage
[02:07:31] or why you should be treated for these.
[02:07:33] And the way it's looked at is based on PTSD,
[02:07:35] or everything is broken down in parts.
[02:07:39] Your back is one part.
[02:07:40] Your PTSD, your mental health is one part.
[02:07:42] Your arm is one part of that.
[02:07:44] And they're all looked at differently in that way.
[02:07:46] And so it puts a veteran in a position
[02:07:47] where they have to sort of now prove in some ways
[02:07:51] that they are deserving of this disability.
[02:07:53] It can be very retraumatizing for someone
[02:07:55] who's maybe never shared about something that happened
[02:07:57] in the sexual assault or something that happened to me
[02:08:00] while I was deployed or something that's sort of embarrassing,
[02:08:02] or I hold a lot of shame about because I haven't really
[02:08:04] dealt with now I'm in this position where I have to sort
[02:08:06] of recount all this.
[02:08:07] I have to get these character references for these things
[02:08:10] that happen to sort of prove that I'm worthy of this disability,
[02:08:13] which then opens me up to these resources in some ways.
[02:08:16] And so that part, what we can do sort of like as a leader
[02:08:22] in an initial response to somebody,
[02:08:24] say they're coming to tell us something that's going on,
[02:08:27] how we react in that moment is huge because it's
[02:08:29] going to set the precedent for whether or not
[02:08:31] that person is going to reengage should something be going on
[02:08:34] for them or if it's a safe place to talk about the things that
[02:08:36] are going on.
[02:08:37] So to answer your question a long way around,
[02:08:39] I don't know about nationally what
[02:08:41] we're doing if it's the right thing to do,
[02:08:43] but I do know engagement and all of the resources
[02:08:45] that are being put out there is still an issue.
[02:08:48] And I read something from the Navy,
[02:08:52] like it was like a 2021 study around veteran suicide rates
[02:08:55] and all of these different things.
[02:08:57] And the suicide rate daily for those individuals
[02:08:59] who were engaged with the BHA was less than those who were not.
[02:09:04] So engagement is a really important factor
[02:09:08] in how do we keep people doing that.
[02:09:10] Well, I think making sure that we understand
[02:09:12] how important privacy is to someone
[02:09:15] who's dealing with something like this
[02:09:17] and the fear of retaliation.
[02:09:20] Like, will you take something that's important to me?
[02:09:22] Will you take my wings?
[02:09:23] Like, will you know that these are people's full identity?
[02:09:27] Will I lose my status by spot as part of this group
[02:09:31] that I've been so connected to?
[02:09:34] I see this a lot in folks coming through
[02:09:36] and special operations or things like that.
[02:09:39] Like, they're more likely to seek services,
[02:09:42] in my experience, outside of the military,
[02:09:46] out of fear of those two things.
[02:09:48] Yeah.
[02:09:49] I got...
[02:09:52] I being aware of what's going on in the world
[02:09:55] is such an advantage.
[02:09:57] And my basic example of that is if you came to my house
[02:10:01] and I said, hey, I'm gonna scare you
[02:10:04] when you walk down the hallway.
[02:10:06] And then you walk down the hallway
[02:10:07] and I jumped out and said, boo, you wouldn't be scared at all.
[02:10:09] If I didn't tell you that
[02:10:11] and you came walking down my house
[02:10:12] and I jumped out of the doorway and screamed at you,
[02:10:15] you'd be scared, because that's what would happen.
[02:10:17] So being aware of what's going on
[02:10:19] just makes you so much more prepared for it.
[02:10:20] So I realized, working with fighters and being in combat,
[02:10:27] you'd see like a new guy that was on his first deployment
[02:10:30] and you'd see him before an operation
[02:10:32] and you'd see he's really nervous.
[02:10:35] And maybe feels like a little bit sick to his stomach.
[02:10:38] He's gone to the bathroom four times in the last 20 minutes
[02:10:40] and you're like, oh yeah, he's got a little bit of that,
[02:10:42] a little bit of those nerves going.
[02:10:44] And you say something to him like, hey man,
[02:10:46] that's the fourth time you go to the bathroom.
[02:10:48] Are you all right?
[02:10:49] They're like, I'm fine.
[02:10:50] And you're like, hey, dude, it's fine.
[02:10:51] Like you're nervous, you might get killed.
[02:10:54] It's no big deal to be a little bit nervous.
[02:10:56] And I go, oh, okay.
[02:10:58] Okay, it's okay.
[02:10:59] It's okay that you're nervous.
[02:11:00] You should be nervous.
[02:11:01] If you're not nervous, there's something wrong with you.
[02:11:03] And then, so I took that and I actually used it
[02:11:05] when I was training mixed martial arts fighters
[02:11:08] because the same thing would happen.
[02:11:10] They'd be going the night of the UFC
[02:11:13] or a few hours before they're all nervous.
[02:11:15] You could see that they're nervous,
[02:11:17] but they don't know what it is.
[02:11:18] They don't know why they feel sick.
[02:11:20] So they think there's something wrong with them.
[02:11:21] So now they're freaking out.
[02:11:23] So you go, oh, hey, you just went to the bathroom
[02:11:25] for the ninth time in the last half an hour.
[02:11:27] You're feeling a little nervous and they go,
[02:11:29] no, I don't know what's wrong with me.
[02:11:30] Hey, what's wrong with you
[02:11:31] is you're getting ready to go into combat.
[02:11:33] You're getting ready to take some chances.
[02:11:34] And that's your body getting ready,
[02:11:37] getting rid of all the stuff it doesn't need right now
[02:11:39] so it can focus on fighting.
[02:11:40] This is good.
[02:11:42] And they think, oh, okay.
[02:11:44] So that's what normal is.
[02:11:45] It's okay to feel like that.
[02:11:47] I had a guy on my podcast named Tom Fife
[02:11:50] who was in World War II Korea in Vietnam
[02:11:52] and he got a purple heart in World War II Korea in Vietnam.
[02:11:56] And I was asking him,
[02:11:58] he was a battalion commander in Vietnam.
[02:12:00] And so this was, it had been 55 or 60 years
[02:12:03] since he was in Vietnam.
[02:12:05] And I was asking him about what type of operations
[02:12:09] they were doing and then I started asking him
[02:12:11] about what kind of casualties he took in his battalion.
[02:12:16] And as he started to address that,
[02:12:19] he started getting choked up talking about it.
[02:12:23] And I remember I'm sitting there thinking
[02:12:25] it's been 60 years for this guy
[02:12:28] and he was a battalion commander and he lost guys
[02:12:30] and he still gets choked up about it.
[02:12:32] And because that'll happen to me.
[02:12:34] I'll be talking to someone about some of the guys
[02:12:35] that I lost and I'll get choked up.
[02:12:37] And I said to myself, oh, this is just the way it is.
[02:12:39] And it's normal and it's okay.
[02:12:42] And I think that's a huge part that we missed out on
[02:12:47] and that we have missed out on is someone going,
[02:12:50] oh, I'm sad, there must be something wrong with me.
[02:12:55] And it's like, no, you're sad, you lost your friend.
[02:12:58] And you lost your friend and now you feel sad
[02:13:00] and that's what you're gonna feel like.
[02:13:02] And over time it'll dissipate a little bit
[02:13:04] and then it might come back.
[02:13:05] You know, it's another thing that I talked about.
[02:13:09] I talked about losing people and what you go through
[02:13:11] and what, and I went through this big dramatic description
[02:13:16] of being caught in a storm.
[02:13:19] And when you lose someone, when one of your friends dies,
[02:13:23] you're gonna be hit with emotions that you can't control.
[02:13:26] And we as adults, we're not used to not being able
[02:13:29] to control emotions anymore.
[02:13:31] That happens when you're five years old.
[02:13:33] It shouldn't happen when I'm 40.
[02:13:35] So my friend dies, all of a sudden I get hit
[02:13:37] with these emotions, I'm not in control anymore
[02:13:39] and I don't like that feeling
[02:13:41] and I think there must be something wrong with me.
[02:13:42] It's like, no, actually, this is what's normal.
[02:13:45] You're gonna get hit with these emotions, but guess what?
[02:13:46] Eventually those waves of emotions will go away
[02:13:51] and you'll have a break.
[02:13:54] Okay, so then you think, okay, well then I'm fine.
[02:13:56] But then you get hit randomly.
[02:13:57] You see something, you hear a song,
[02:13:59] you smell something, you drive by whatever restaurant
[02:14:01] and you get hit with that emotion again.
[02:14:03] You don't notice this, but it's not quite as strong.
[02:14:06] And there's been a little space and over time,
[02:14:08] the strength of the emotional waves starts to lessen.
[02:14:13] And this is what I learned this for myself
[02:14:15] because I experienced it a bunch of times.
[02:14:18] And by the sixth or seventh or eighth time,
[02:14:20] I was saying, oh yeah, this is that emotion
[02:14:22] that I'm gonna feel right now
[02:14:23] and I don't can't control it
[02:14:24] and I'm gonna sit here and cry
[02:14:26] and then I'm gonna stop and then 20 minutes later
[02:14:28] I'm gonna be laughing and that'll seem fine.
[02:14:31] It'll seem like I'm okay, but then a week later
[02:14:33] I'll get hit with this other emotion again with a sadness
[02:14:35] and it'll knock me down,
[02:14:38] but it's gonna lessen over time and it's gonna dissipate.
[02:14:42] So I think a lot of this is people don't understand
[02:14:47] what's normal and I think that everything I just said
[02:14:49] is totally normal.
[02:14:50] And now that I've told that to a bunch of people,
[02:14:51] yeah, this is what you're gonna feel,
[02:14:52] they've been like, that's exactly what I felt.
[02:14:54] And so getting the word out about, yeah, oh yeah,
[02:14:58] you're gonna feel sad.
[02:14:59] This doesn't mean you're depressed,
[02:15:00] it means you're sad, your friend died.
[02:15:02] Like that's a horrible thing,
[02:15:04] but it's okay to feel sad and it's okay
[02:15:08] and in a little while it'll dissipate.
[02:15:10] That's another thing people get caught up in is,
[02:15:13] oh, the strong emotions that I had are now dissipating.
[02:15:17] I must be, I didn't really care about them
[02:15:20] or I'm a bad person,
[02:15:23] no, you're just processing it
[02:15:25] and you're moving through this thing.
[02:15:27] So I think a lot of just the,
[02:15:31] you know, what you were talking about earlier,
[02:15:33] Karlyn, of just not talking about things
[02:15:37] and I've been very lucky.
[02:15:38] And this is another thing I noticed about loss
[02:15:41] is when I would lose one of my friends,
[02:15:43] oftentimes I would be the person that would be giving
[02:15:47] a speech or one of the people that would be writing down
[02:15:51] my feelings about the situation,
[02:15:53] about who this person was,
[02:15:54] about what they meant to me,
[02:15:56] about how awesome they were.
[02:15:57] I'd have to go through that drill, mandatory,
[02:16:00] because you're gonna get up and you're gonna talk,
[02:16:01] you're gonna give a eulogy
[02:16:02] or one of the eulogies at someone's funeral,
[02:16:05] someone's memorial service.
[02:16:06] So that's what you're doing.
[02:16:08] What a cathartic thing that turned out to be.
[02:16:11] Then I end up, when I get out of the Navy,
[02:16:14] I end up writing books and oftentimes
[02:16:16] these things are addressed in the books.
[02:16:18] And being on this podcast or going out and speaking to
[02:16:21] groups of people, guess what I'm doing?
[02:16:22] I'm telling a story over and over again.
[02:16:26] The same story about the same situation.
[02:16:29] And each time you tell it, you go,
[02:16:32] okay, you process it and it moves you further
[02:16:35] down that road and it helps you detach from it,
[02:16:37] not in a bad way, but in a good way,
[02:16:40] where you can be truly appreciative of the friend
[02:16:42] that you lost and say, yeah, it's horrible.
[02:16:46] But guess what, I had some good times,
[02:16:47] we had some great times, we had some incredible times.
[02:16:49] And I'm gonna live a good life and not forget about them,
[02:16:53] but I'm not gonna dwell on the fact that they died.
[02:16:55] And by the way, guess what that means?
[02:16:56] That means I'm gonna die too.
[02:16:58] And everyone I know is gonna die.
[02:17:02] And I can't get caught up and dwell on that fact for so long.
[02:17:07] So it seems like those are the kind of things
[02:17:09] that I think we could do better is letting people understand
[02:17:14] what they're going through,
[02:17:14] letting them understand that it's normal, it's normal.
[02:17:19] It's normal to be like, oh yeah, what's wrong with Jocko?
[02:17:21] He just heard a song and he's gonna go over there
[02:17:23] and cry for like eight minutes.
[02:17:25] And just then he's gonna be okay.
[02:17:27] And Jocko is not embarrassed by it.
[02:17:29] It's like, oh yeah, this song freaking
[02:17:31] bums me out sometimes.
[02:17:33] Okay, well, that's not abnormal.
[02:17:36] You lost one of your best friends.
[02:17:38] Okay, well, it's gonna be sad sometimes.
[02:17:40] And I think that's one thing that we can do better
[02:17:44] and I try and do that as much as I can
[02:17:46] when we talk about these things on this podcast.
[02:17:49] But it also sounds like that's the kind of thing
[02:17:51] that you all would do with people
[02:17:54] as you talk them through issues
[02:17:56] that they've gone through in your life.
[02:17:57] Am I accurate?
[02:17:58] Absolutely, well, and to speak to the example
[02:18:01] you gave with the gentleman you noticed
[02:18:03] he was going to the bathroom.
[02:18:04] I mean, you also saw him.
[02:18:05] Like you saw him.
[02:18:07] You saw he was struggling through something.
[02:18:09] You chose to engage, you chose to interact.
[02:18:11] And I think that that, you know,
[02:18:12] not just from the encouragement or the cognitive part
[02:18:15] of the conversation, but to see people,
[02:18:16] to notice them is huge because, you know,
[02:18:20] that could have gone completely unnoticed
[02:18:21] and in his mind he could have created
[02:18:23] a whole different narrative about everybody else
[02:18:25] seems to be fine and they're doing okay
[02:18:26] and they've got it together.
[02:18:27] Isn't there a bunch of seals?
[02:18:28] They're all acting like they're fine.
[02:18:29] And I'm different in some ways, you know.
[02:18:32] So to see that person to make that eye contact.
[02:18:34] Yeah, like I must be a coward.
[02:18:35] That's the scary thing.
[02:18:36] Like I must be a coward.
[02:18:37] Oh my gosh, why is everyone walking around like a badass?
[02:18:40] And I'm sitting here like a coward.
[02:18:42] Yep, and in the absence of the communication
[02:18:43] or in the attunement that you gave him,
[02:18:45] like all kinds of things can happen.
[02:18:47] So that's huge.
[02:18:49] Yeah, and I think with, especially in the treatment world
[02:18:53] and at a new for sure, a lot of our clients come in.
[02:18:57] The ones who have been in the system for a bit,
[02:19:01] this is like not their first rodeo.
[02:19:03] There is that identity that has almost been adopted
[02:19:06] a lot of the times, like I'm schizophrenic.
[02:19:09] So I need to take these pills.
[02:19:11] Curse.
[02:19:12] Yeah, I'm cursed.
[02:19:13] I need to take these pills.
[02:19:14] What, why are you taking them?
[02:19:16] I don't know, it's just what they give me.
[02:19:18] Right, there's this kind of,
[02:19:21] when will my symptoms go away?
[02:19:22] Right, this lack of what you're talking about is like,
[02:19:26] it's totally normal that that's happening today.
[02:19:28] I get yesterday you felt great
[02:19:29] and today you woke up thinking these things
[02:19:32] that you weren't thinking yesterday.
[02:19:35] Yes, we're gonna move and march toward
[02:19:38] look, what can we do about it?
[02:19:39] What can we do to help you feel better?
[02:19:41] Sometimes it's just going and having your cry over there
[02:19:43] and then come back on over, totally fine.
[02:19:45] But the idea of validating is what you're talking about.
[02:19:48] It's like, yep, that's happening.
[02:19:50] I get it and it sucks today
[02:19:52] and it may even suck tomorrow.
[02:19:53] You have schizophrenia.
[02:19:55] This might be something that you deal with
[02:19:57] on and off your entire life,
[02:19:58] but by doing these things, having it normalized,
[02:20:02] people being seen, people supporting versus,
[02:20:07] why are you doing that?
[02:20:08] Over time, it gets less and less.
[02:20:10] Yeah, that's what I was gonna say,
[02:20:12] but the little kid that asked me,
[02:20:13] like I feel like I'm alone.
[02:20:15] Yeah, you're gonna feel alone.
[02:20:17] That's totally normal.
[02:20:17] Sometimes you're gonna be alone.
[02:20:18] Like that's gonna happen.
[02:20:20] And when you're a teenager and you don't get invited
[02:20:23] to the party, you're gonna be bummed out.
[02:20:26] That's just normal.
[02:20:27] That's just like, oh, and when you're a teenager
[02:20:29] and your boyfriend or your girlfriend dumps you,
[02:20:32] yeah, you're gonna feel sad.
[02:20:33] And that's just the way you feel.
[02:20:34] And in a little while, you won't even remember
[02:20:36] that person was and you'll carry on with the rest of your life.
[02:20:37] So being aware of what's going on in these peaks
[02:20:42] and valleys of life, knowing that they're there,
[02:20:46] is such a positive thing.
[02:20:48] And a lot of times, and I guess,
[02:20:50] especially going back to social media,
[02:20:51] it's like, oh, if all I see on social media
[02:20:53] is everyone smiling and happy and looks,
[02:20:55] you know, like they're doing some awesome thing
[02:20:57] and I'm sitting at home in my room alone.
[02:21:00] Like, that's life.
[02:21:02] You're gonna be alone.
[02:21:03] You're gonna get dumped.
[02:21:04] You're not gonna get invited to the cool guy party
[02:21:07] and all these things are gonna happen
[02:21:08] and they're totally normal and you'll get through them
[02:21:11] and they're not gonna be fun, but that's the way it is.
[02:21:15] We get a lot of people that don't even recognize
[02:21:20] that this is the way life is.
[02:21:22] Well, actually, we were just talking the other day.
[02:21:24] You know, my friend, Jordan Peterson,
[02:21:27] will say life is suffering, right?
[02:21:29] And it's like a religious context.
[02:21:31] The Buddha says life is suffering.
[02:21:32] And I was like, yeah, you know, I get it.
[02:21:35] That's a good way, it's a good thing to know.
[02:21:37] It's a good thing to know that in life, there is suffering.
[02:21:42] Right?
[02:21:42] But you don't have to go and say life,
[02:21:44] all of life is suffering.
[02:21:46] There's gonna be some valleys, you know?
[02:21:48] There's gonna be some darkness.
[02:21:49] We get it, but it's not all of life.
[02:21:52] And you're gonna come out of that.
[02:21:54] You're gonna see some light.
[02:21:55] You're gonna have some fun.
[02:21:56] But then you're gonna get sucked down
[02:21:59] into some darkness again.
[02:22:00] And that's what I think people don't,
[02:22:03] or what I think people need to understand
[02:22:04] is there's a cycle to life.
[02:22:06] And you're gonna have some good
[02:22:07] and you're gonna have some bad.
[02:22:08] And that's the same with everybody.
[02:22:09] No one is just basking in the sun
[02:22:14] and the warmth for their whole life,
[02:22:16] unless you're only looking at them on Instagram,
[02:22:18] in which case they're doing it
[02:22:19] and they're doing it in a G-string bikini.
[02:22:21] That's the way they're doing it.
[02:22:23] That's true.
[02:22:24] And with PTSD, a lot of other things too.
[02:22:27] A lot of other conditions or diagnosis.
[02:22:30] I mean, I've heard this so many times,
[02:22:31] we definitely hear it at the treatment center
[02:22:33] for people who've been maybe in an illness
[02:22:36] for a lot longer.
[02:22:36] So when is this gonna go away?
[02:22:38] When am I gonna not have this anymore?
[02:22:40] And this idea of like, it may not,
[02:22:42] kind of like with trauma, right?
[02:22:43] Every time you remember that buddy or hear that song,
[02:22:46] you're gonna have a little something show up.
[02:22:48] And yeah, is it less than before?
[02:22:51] Sure, but like your whole life,
[02:22:54] every time you hear that song,
[02:22:55] you might feel a little something going on there
[02:22:57] and that's okay.
[02:22:57] Like it's totally normal.
[02:22:59] I feel that when I hear the star-spangled banner.
[02:23:01] Yes, every time.
[02:23:02] Like when I hear the star-spangled banner,
[02:23:04] if I'm not careful, I'll get like super emotional.
[02:23:08] From the start.
[02:23:09] And that's a song that you hear a lot, right?
[02:23:10] All the time.
[02:23:11] I mean, you heard every sporting event.
[02:23:12] So yeah, and here's the thing.
[02:23:15] I guess in my own narcissistic mind,
[02:23:17] I've thought, hey, that's normal and that's okay.
[02:23:20] It's okay, it's okay to feel like that.
[02:23:22] This is the way things go.
[02:23:23] Where you mentioned, quickly there, you mentioned drugs.
[02:23:28] And I just had a friend of mine on the podcast
[02:23:31] who by the time he went and sought help
[02:23:35] in the Navy, he was in the SEAL teams,
[02:23:37] by the time he went and sought help,
[02:23:39] he got immediately prescribed something.
[02:23:41] By the time he got out a year or two later,
[02:23:43] he was on seven different drugs.
[02:23:50] You know, this one to get you amped up for the day,
[02:23:55] this one to keep you level-headed,
[02:23:57] this one to put you to sleep at night,
[02:23:58] is like they're all counter to each other.
[02:24:01] And just a disaster.
[02:24:05] At what point, where do these drugs come into play?
[02:24:08] Now, he and I both acknowledged,
[02:24:11] and again, this is something that I know
[02:24:12] from talking and reading, is absolutely,
[02:24:16] there's times like, oh, this person needs
[02:24:18] this specific drug to help them get through the situation.
[02:24:23] Where do you all think these drugs come into play
[02:24:26] and what do we need to be careful of?
[02:24:29] Yeah, I mean, I'm not a psychiatrist,
[02:24:31] so it's hard to speak to that part.
[02:24:33] But generally when somebody's coming in
[02:24:35] on a bunch of different medications,
[02:24:37] you know, there's a conversation about like,
[02:24:39] do you know what you're taking?
[02:24:41] Oftentimes with folks with complex psychiatric disorders,
[02:24:43] they don't.
[02:24:45] It's just, this is what I was told to take.
[02:24:46] You know, what it's treating,
[02:24:48] how do you know that it's helping you
[02:24:50] and really starting to discern that?
[02:24:52] Because I mean, I think we, you know,
[02:24:55] and this, my opinion in some ways,
[02:24:57] been in a culture of sort of instant gratification
[02:24:59] or seeking something outside of myself to soothe.
[02:25:01] You know, there's a lot of benefit
[02:25:03] to various psychiatric medications.
[02:25:05] They can really help stabilize someone in a place
[02:25:08] where without otherwise,
[02:25:09] they might not be able to receive some of that treatment.
[02:25:12] And at some point, assessing like,
[02:25:14] why I use this, I think is really important, right?
[02:25:17] Do I use it because I think it's gonna fix
[02:25:19] or take this thing away?
[02:25:20] I think this would apply to not just a prescription drug,
[02:25:22] but any kind of substance.
[02:25:23] You know, why do I drink?
[02:25:25] Do I do because, you know,
[02:25:26] I enjoy a glass of wine at night or whatever it may be,
[02:25:28] or do I drink to alter my mood?
[02:25:30] Do I change this to alter my mood in a way
[02:25:32] because I don't feel like I can do this independently
[02:25:34] or on my own.
[02:25:35] So I think assessing why someone is using
[02:25:38] the various amount of things
[02:25:39] and their understanding of it.
[02:25:40] And, you know, one of the things,
[02:25:42] the benefits of being able to do a long-term treatment
[02:25:44] in a structured environment is it gives us an opportunity
[02:25:47] to sort of unpack some of these things, obviously,
[02:25:50] with the support of a psychiatrist and somebody,
[02:25:52] you know, who's medical overseeing their care,
[02:25:54] to see, you know, what, in fact,
[02:25:57] is this actually treating at this point?
[02:25:59] Is it helpful?
[02:26:00] And if it is, great.
[02:26:03] But also too, does it take us out of the role
[02:26:05] of like the work?
[02:26:06] Because, you know, therapy is hard work.
[02:26:08] Like people who I think therapy is a soft place to come
[02:26:11] at whatever, therapy is hard work.
[02:26:12] Someone who commits to therapy
[02:26:14] is really willing to do some work.
[02:26:16] I mean, unless you're in a place
[02:26:16] where somebody's just like buttering you up
[02:26:18] and giving you compliments all day long,
[02:26:19] but when you come to do therapy,
[02:26:20] you come to do work, especially
[02:26:22] in a residential treatment center,
[02:26:23] you're not just receiving all these things.
[02:26:26] But medications often is this notion of like,
[02:26:27] I'm just taking this thing,
[02:26:29] but there's no, it's very different
[02:26:32] than the amount of effort that's involved
[02:26:35] in walking through a very difficult situation
[02:26:37] or if I'm afraid of something in particular
[02:26:39] I haven't gone to address some of this unresolved grief
[02:26:43] or, you know, whatever it might be,
[02:26:45] you know, engaging in that behavior is very difficult.
[02:26:47] It's gonna bring up a lot of feelings
[02:26:51] and walking through that can be incredibly healing.
[02:26:54] A very different approach than if I'm choosing
[02:26:56] to just take something to get rid of something.
[02:26:59] Well, I think there's like an agency thing,
[02:27:01] which I think shows up in a lot of your work.
[02:27:03] I mean, even just what you've shared today
[02:27:05] is people say like, oh, I'm feeling so much,
[02:27:08] I'm gonna call my esophageal,
[02:27:09] so I'm gonna call the doctor.
[02:27:10] I need something for this.
[02:27:13] Is very external, one instant gratification,
[02:27:16] but also this, whether the person's aware of it or not,
[02:27:19] this idea that like, I don't believe
[02:27:21] in my ability to manage myself.
[02:27:23] I need you to give me something to feel better.
[02:27:26] And a lot of the longer term work in therapy,
[02:27:29] definitely in our program, because it's so,
[02:27:31] it's longer term, is this idea of helping people
[02:27:35] internalize agency versus just rely on external things
[02:27:38] to like make them be okay.
[02:27:40] You know, that seems like a basic principle
[02:27:42] of success in life.
[02:27:43] But you'd be amazed with people
[02:27:45] with some of these complex psychiatric diagnoses
[02:27:48] that the sense of personal agency is so low,
[02:27:53] whether it's like, I just take these pills
[02:27:54] because my psychiatrist says I'm supposed to
[02:27:56] or my mom says I need to,
[02:27:58] versus like, do you know what are you taking?
[02:28:01] Or having conversation with your doctor
[02:28:02] about side effects or whatever.
[02:28:05] But the sense of, I don't have what it takes
[02:28:09] to manage myself and my situation and the demands of life.
[02:28:14] So I need- That's a horrible mindset.
[02:28:16] Horrible, and it's very, very common
[02:28:18] with mental illness.
[02:28:20] And I mentioned, I talked about SSRIs
[02:28:24] on some other podcast and I read through the comments
[02:28:29] and there was definitely some people that were like,
[02:28:30] hey, these things really helped me.
[02:28:32] And there was, of course, you're gonna get that side
[02:28:35] and you of course got the side of like,
[02:28:37] oh, that stuff was a disaster for me.
[02:28:40] The side effects, when you read the side effects,
[02:28:42] you're like, oh my God, you know,
[02:28:44] like emotional, blunting, violence, bipolar,
[02:28:46] switch, suicide risk from the medicine that you're taking.
[02:28:49] So there's definite risks need to,
[02:28:52] that needs to be paid attention to.
[02:28:56] The other side of the spectrum, as far as I'm concerned,
[02:29:00] is something that you already mentioned, Karlin.
[02:29:04] What about just like a sleep, diet, and exercise?
[02:29:08] How often are we blowing that?
[02:29:13] Often.
[02:29:14] Often.
[02:29:14] Often.
[02:29:15] I mean, it is amazing when we bring folks
[02:29:18] into the program, we try and set aside
[02:29:20] like kind of the first month, give or take,
[02:29:22] it may take longer.
[02:29:24] Cause this person maybe has not been sleeping well at all.
[02:29:27] Not eating well.
[02:29:29] Like maybe they've been using, maybe they haven't.
[02:29:32] Poor hygiene.
[02:29:33] Caffeine, smoking, I mean, you name it.
[02:29:35] So just like getting somebody eating well
[02:29:38] and on a regular basis, getting some physical exercise,
[02:29:42] getting like their sleep hygiene in order.
[02:29:45] Structuring some habits throughout the day.
[02:29:47] You wouldn't be amazed how much changes
[02:29:49] just in that little period of time.
[02:29:51] And we've talked with folks that,
[02:29:53] and this is also related to the meds,
[02:29:55] is sometimes when people have,
[02:29:56] they're seeing multiple doctors,
[02:29:58] or they go in and they see a different doctor every time.
[02:30:01] And they may not be coordinating,
[02:30:03] so you're just getting all kinds of meds and things
[02:30:05] that may not even really go together.
[02:30:07] So same with diagnoses.
[02:30:09] We've had folks come in with a laundry list of diagnoses.
[02:30:13] I'm like, you can't even have half of those at the same time.
[02:30:16] They're both at the same time.
[02:30:17] But these were all little snapshots of,
[02:30:18] oh, this trip to the ER and this trip to the hospital,
[02:30:20] like this is what they look like that day.
[02:30:22] And that's what they look like this day.
[02:30:23] It doesn't mean they have all of those things.
[02:30:25] So let's get them eating and sleeping and in a routine
[02:30:29] and comfortable showering.
[02:30:32] Physical activity.
[02:30:33] It's the basic psychological and physical wellness and safety.
[02:30:37] And guess what?
[02:30:38] Almost all of these diagnoses go away.
[02:30:40] Maybe we're left with these couple right here.
[02:30:43] Yeah, I was on Joe Rogan's podcast,
[02:30:45] and it was the morning of Chris Cornell
[02:30:51] from Soundgarden had killed himself.
[02:30:53] And of course, Joe and I started talking about it.
[02:30:58] And look, we're just a couple of knuckle-draggers talking.
[02:31:02] But both of us were kind of like, man,
[02:31:05] get a kettlebell to work out.
[02:31:07] And again, like I said,
[02:31:09] we're just a couple knuckle-draggers talking.
[02:31:13] And again, reading the comments, people are like,
[02:31:18] oh, you think just working out's gonna solve everything.
[02:31:20] And of course, I don't think that, but damn,
[02:31:24] it's a good thing to do.
[02:31:26] Go get healthy.
[02:31:27] Get on a sleep schedule where you're doing,
[02:31:29] like where you're getting some good sleep.
[02:31:32] Eat good food.
[02:31:33] Stop eating trash.
[02:31:35] Go outside.
[02:31:37] Move around.
[02:31:38] This is real, right?
[02:31:40] Yeah, I mean, it's both and.
[02:31:41] Because without the structure that we create,
[02:31:43] the therapeutic process that we try to do is not possible.
[02:31:46] Like without the routine, without the sleep,
[02:31:49] without the healthy eating,
[02:31:51] can't actually do that therapeutic part.
[02:31:52] So there's a lot that can happen
[02:31:54] in that initial structure of physical activity and all this.
[02:31:57] And for those folks with those clinical aspects
[02:31:59] that require a deeper level of therapeutic intervention
[02:32:02] or psychiatric support, that's the framework.
[02:32:04] That has to maintain.
[02:32:05] That never changes.
[02:32:07] That structure and stability is the main component
[02:32:10] that holds the foundation for everything else
[02:32:13] to be able to be possible.
[02:32:14] So it's definitely, with any sort of complex human issue,
[02:32:18] you can't say that one thing is gonna solve anything.
[02:32:20] Of course.
[02:32:21] But that is undoubtedly the foundation for,
[02:32:24] which all else sort of occurs for our folks
[02:32:27] and becomes the thing that they maintain long term
[02:32:30] when they move into their own houses.
[02:32:31] They're still getting up at a certain time.
[02:32:33] They might pick their day that they go grocery shopping.
[02:32:36] They might, because that structure and routine
[02:32:38] is very helpful.
[02:32:39] Human beings like that, don't we?
[02:32:42] And when you live without it,
[02:32:43] it's just the beginning of possible serious issues.
[02:32:49] Now, here's another thing that I talked about on a podcast.
[02:32:52] This was around mass shootings.
[02:32:56] And as myself and my friend Darrell were looking
[02:33:00] into the various causes behind these mass shootings,
[02:33:04] one of the most shocking pieces of information
[02:33:10] that we came across is this right here.
[02:33:12] So in 1955, in America, there were 340 inpatient beds
[02:33:19] per 100,000 people.
[02:33:21] So I'm gonna say that again in 1955,
[02:33:23] 1955 for every 100,000 people there were in America,
[02:33:28] there were 340 inpatient beds for mental health care.
[02:33:35] Now, here we are, you fast forward to 2007.
[02:33:40] In 2007, there were only 17 beds for every 100,000 people.
[02:33:49] And here we are, we talk about mental health all the time.
[02:33:51] Now, some of the feedback that I got about that episode
[02:33:54] was that in the 50s and 60s,
[02:33:59] there were these really heinous,
[02:34:02] some really heinous events that happened
[02:34:05] inside these psychiatric wards and people were abused.
[02:34:09] And they pretty much from everything I can tell
[02:34:12] threw the baby out of the bathwater and just said,
[02:34:15] oh, you know what, we're just gonna shut these things.
[02:34:17] Abuse happens in these places, we'll shut them all down.
[02:34:23] I think about, like, you know, I live in San Diego.
[02:34:26] I think about what there's a couple million people
[02:34:28] in San Diego, that means that there would be
[02:34:31] a few thousand inpatient beds if we were on the 1955 levels.
[02:34:36] And if you go around San Diego
[02:34:38] and you go look at the homeless people,
[02:34:40] many of whom have psychological and mental health issues,
[02:34:45] if you opened up all those beds,
[02:34:47] they would probably fill them
[02:34:48] and we'd be in a much different place.
[02:34:50] And these people would be getting some kind of treatment
[02:34:53] that they actually need.
[02:34:54] What do you think happened with this?
[02:34:58] Is it just the abuse that took place,
[02:35:00] we shut them down, is there anything else?
[02:35:02] I mean, there's a lot to this.
[02:35:04] I mean, you're talking about the deinstitutionalization.
[02:35:06] Like, I mean, some of this started even back
[02:35:08] into the 1700s, but there's like, at the time,
[02:35:12] in the time that you're referring to,
[02:35:13] primarily residential facilities
[02:35:16] is where folks would be able to take their loved ones
[02:35:18] with mental health, right?
[02:35:19] So if people had mental health issues,
[02:35:20] they went into these residential facilities
[02:35:23] and that's where they primarily received treatment,
[02:35:25] or just a place to stay.
[02:35:27] And then as that evolved, sometimes,
[02:35:30] I think the term asylum came along at some point,
[02:35:32] this became a place where people could stay
[02:35:34] and also work and session they were having.
[02:35:36] But what was really happening on the inside
[02:35:39] was a pretty restrictive setting in some ways.
[02:35:41] And then there was some people that had gone in
[02:35:44] and saw all this horrific stuff that was happening.
[02:35:47] And so ultimately, all of these sort of things
[02:35:49] move towards this idea that a person is entitled
[02:35:51] to the least restrictive settings.
[02:35:53] And there's a lot of stuff that happened
[02:35:54] over the course of the period of time for this,
[02:35:56] but that a person should not be chained up,
[02:35:58] they should be entitled to the least restrictive setting.
[02:36:00] And so then you also had the notion then coming in
[02:36:04] of SSDI and SSI and these different things
[02:36:08] that started reform as federal movements.
[02:36:09] But people-
[02:36:10] SSDI and SSI. So it's Social Security Disability Income,
[02:36:13] or Social Security Income that came from a federal movement.
[02:36:16] So this part where people who were in inpatient facilities
[02:36:19] at the time were not entitled to those resources.
[02:36:21] And so sort of forced this max,
[02:36:23] this set of exodus, this discharge from hospitals
[02:36:27] for them to be able to receive these services.
[02:36:29] And what you find at that time,
[02:36:30] then it also, some of the states created some laws
[02:36:34] that made it much more difficult for people
[02:36:35] to readmit to inpatient settings.
[02:36:38] So the notion was good, this idea
[02:36:40] that people will do better in the community,
[02:36:41] they'll do better in the least restrictive setting.
[02:36:43] Let's create these resources like SSDI
[02:36:46] and such like that for them.
[02:36:47] However, it sort of flipped its on its head
[02:36:49] in terms of the amount of resources
[02:36:51] that the community wasn't ready to absorb that.
[02:36:53] So what we saw is sometime in some states,
[02:36:55] I think California, I can't remember the year,
[02:36:57] but in the year of sort of discharge of hospitals out
[02:37:01] into we saw the jail population double in California.
[02:37:05] And the homeless population,
[02:37:06] but they think what I recently read
[02:37:08] is something around like 65% of the jails
[02:37:12] are full of people with mental health issues.
[02:37:14] I was talking to a police officer
[02:37:16] a month, month and a half ago,
[02:37:18] and he was just, he had heard that podcast
[02:37:21] and he was like, yeah, he goes,
[02:37:22] I 100% have to arrest people
[02:37:27] and there's no possible way that they belong in jail.
[02:37:30] They belong in some kind of a mental health facility
[02:37:32] and there's nowhere to take them.
[02:37:34] So guess where they go?
[02:37:35] They go to jail.
[02:37:35] Right, right.
[02:37:36] Or they don't go anywhere,
[02:37:38] or they just get,
[02:37:39] they might get go into jail for two nights
[02:37:42] and then they get kicked out,
[02:37:43] but back out on the street
[02:37:45] and they're just deteriorating.
[02:37:46] Well, and if you read about this,
[02:37:47] I mean, depending on where you come from,
[02:37:49] congressman, rulemaker, they're gonna say financial stuff,
[02:37:51] whatever, like everybody has sort of a different
[02:37:53] rationale as to why the institutionalization of the outcome.
[02:37:57] But ultimately what we know is that
[02:37:59] we didn't know anything really around that time
[02:38:01] around complex psychiatric illnesses.
[02:38:02] It was just in the mid 50s at the first,
[02:38:06] like the 1950s, anti-psychotic drug was released.
[02:38:09] Prior to that, it was, you know,
[02:38:11] people with mental illness,
[02:38:12] like they'd never be cured, right?
[02:38:13] There was the myth of mental illness.
[02:38:15] We didn't know too much about it.
[02:38:16] And so I think Thorazine was the first anti-psychotic
[02:38:19] that came out in the 1950s.
[02:38:21] And so at that point it was like,
[02:38:22] oh, well people can get better.
[02:38:24] And that was a very also pivotal movement
[02:38:27] in the de-institutionalization of people
[02:38:28] that historically had been able to be seen as like,
[02:38:30] they just will always need to live in some type of facility.
[02:38:33] It became, oh, we can like do something with this.
[02:38:35] And today obviously there's tons of different things,
[02:38:37] but yeah, it definitely had an impact
[02:38:41] on our homeless and jail population.
[02:38:43] Is there any movement back in the other direction at all?
[02:38:48] I mean, I don't know too much to speak to that part,
[02:38:50] but what I will say about like Anu
[02:38:52] and what Humblechia had been for a very long time
[02:38:54] is it's a very unique model of care
[02:38:57] that allows for a full continuum of care
[02:38:59] where people can have like a residential setting
[02:39:03] sort of right out of the hospital for a long-term period
[02:39:06] of time and then fluidly move through
[02:39:08] transitional residential for a person
[02:39:11] to be able to kind of integrate what they need.
[02:39:12] And then also to be able to move back
[02:39:14] into that inpatient setting if they need to.
[02:39:16] And instead of sort of this pattern of,
[02:39:19] I end up in the hospital,
[02:39:21] I get discharged to either home environment
[02:39:23] or a place that's not conducive for me
[02:39:25] to be able to integrate that treatment episode.
[02:39:27] I'm out on the streets or I'm not receiving the care I need
[02:39:30] until I regress again that I've been back in the hospital
[02:39:33] to utilize all these emergency services.
[02:39:35] Like, and our model of care really allows people
[02:39:37] to stay long-term in a way that they can move fluidly
[02:39:40] through this and avoid really moving
[02:39:42] into the hospitalizations.
[02:39:43] But it's also, it's a private pay model.
[02:39:46] It's that, you know, insurance is not gonna pay
[02:39:48] for that for folks, right?
[02:39:49] Because, and so folks who are primarily dependent
[02:39:52] on insurance and such like that will find themselves
[02:39:54] in more short-term environments.
[02:39:58] Kind of like crisis intervention.
[02:39:59] Environments which just, it creates kind of a revolving door.
[02:40:03] Right, I'm in crisis, I come in here for a couple of days,
[02:40:07] a couple of hours, maybe a week, stabilize, get out.
[02:40:11] There's nothing available for me once I'm out.
[02:40:13] So I deteriorate and then I come back, right?
[02:40:16] Or I end up in jail because oftentimes people
[02:40:18] with mental illness.
[02:40:19] Versus like the idea with deinstitutionalization
[02:40:23] was this idea of people having more rights,
[02:40:25] more agency, being out in the community,
[02:40:27] not being locked up.
[02:40:29] But then, so kind of, they're released
[02:40:32] to nothing that could hold them.
[02:40:34] So like what you were saying, Megan,
[02:40:36] is a lot of our clients come in from a hospital
[02:40:41] or like could have been in one,
[02:40:43] maybe they've been maintained at home,
[02:40:45] but like not well.
[02:40:46] And it takes, it's like this whole arc,
[02:40:49] it takes a long time to stabilize.
[02:40:51] All the stuff we just talked about with sleep and food
[02:40:53] before we can even get into the nitty gritty of like,
[02:40:56] what is going on here and what needs to happen?
[02:40:58] Let's get you off these 14 meds.
[02:41:00] Let's figure out what was really happening.
[02:41:02] Like this takes a long time.
[02:41:03] So the idea was nice.
[02:41:05] It was like kind of a humane idea,
[02:41:08] but the outside world was not equipped
[02:41:12] to receive all of these folks and actually help them.
[02:41:16] So they got worse, deteriorated and then their symptoms
[02:41:19] and then they're getting arrested,
[02:41:20] they're getting picked up.
[02:41:22] You know, you go to drop them off at some emergency room.
[02:41:26] They'll sit in the lobby for a day or two.
[02:41:27] Get some meds.
[02:41:29] There's your meds again and they're out.
[02:41:32] So I would think that the long term hope
[02:41:35] is that this model of treatment,
[02:41:37] which right now is basically for people
[02:41:40] that can afford it and it's expensive,
[02:41:42] is that over time people start to recognize
[02:41:46] this should be a number one,
[02:41:49] a type of treatment that should be covered by insurance.
[02:41:51] And number two, at some point,
[02:41:53] it gets to a situation where the public,
[02:41:56] there can be some public offering
[02:41:58] of treatment centers like this,
[02:42:01] but it's gotta be proven for an even longer.
[02:42:03] I mean, you've already been doing this for how long, Karlyn?
[02:42:05] 25 years.
[02:42:06] 25 years.
[02:42:07] You've seen incredible successes over those 25 years.
[02:42:10] And yeah, I mean, I hope that as people hear this,
[02:42:15] as people learn more about the methodology that you're using,
[02:42:18] first of all, like just other people in the private sector
[02:42:21] will pick up this type of model and start moving with it.
[02:42:23] And then eventually insurance hopefully starts
[02:42:26] to cover it and then eventually we start saying,
[02:42:28] oh, these homeless people on the street
[02:42:32] that have psychological problems,
[02:42:34] the worst thing we could do is take them,
[02:42:36] throw them in a prison or throw them in a jail for two days
[02:42:39] and kick them back on the street.
[02:42:40] We're just gonna do that.
[02:42:41] It's a never ending cycle.
[02:42:42] To get back to a point where look,
[02:42:45] do we wanna have people chained up to walls
[02:42:47] and having lobotomies and having electroshock therapy?
[02:42:50] No, obviously we don't.
[02:42:51] That's horrible.
[02:42:53] And I owe an episode on some of those horror shows
[02:42:57] that have taken place in the past.
[02:43:00] But to get to a point where there's only 17 beds
[02:43:04] per 100,000 people, I mean,
[02:43:06] you take 100,000 human beings with all the fragility
[02:43:11] of someone's brain and mind
[02:43:14] and you think you're only gonna need 17 inpatient beds.
[02:43:17] That's a crazy thought and yet that's where we're at.
[02:43:20] So what my hope is, is this model that you all are executing
[02:43:25] starts to be seen as the way to actually help people
[02:43:29] and it can broaden beyond people that can afford
[02:43:33] this type of treatment,
[02:43:34] because this type of treatment is very expensive.
[02:43:37] And we can, number one, get insurance to cover it
[02:43:39] and number two, hopefully eventually get it to a point
[02:43:42] where a model like this can be used
[02:43:44] on a broader public scale that the state can pay for
[02:43:49] if people need it.
[02:43:50] And yeah, like affordable and accessible.
[02:43:53] And by the way, I just wanna pause
[02:43:55] because you have been a great support to us.
[02:43:57] I mean, not only in the new treatment center,
[02:43:59] but in our previous facilities.
[02:44:01] So like you said in the beginning, coming in is like,
[02:44:04] I just am gonna invest some money here some guys.
[02:44:06] But your contribution and your involvement in that
[02:44:10] and staying involved, I think about seven, eight, nine years
[02:44:13] with our group has helped make this possible.
[02:44:17] So thank you.
[02:44:18] Yeah, absolutely.
[02:44:20] But that would be my hope too, right?
[02:44:22] Is what are the, if you look at any National Institute
[02:44:25] for Mental Health or CDC, one in five people
[02:44:28] has is considered having like kind of a mental health
[02:44:33] experience.
[02:44:34] One in 20 is considered as having like a serious mental
[02:44:39] health diagnosis or condition.
[02:44:41] One in 20, so I don't know the math and 100,000 people.
[02:44:45] How many does that turn out to?
[02:44:46] And we got 17 beds.
[02:44:47] I mean, it's insane.
[02:44:50] Yeah, it's horrible.
[02:44:54] Probably a good place to wrap it up.
[02:44:55] What, did we miss anything?
[02:44:59] Yeah, the one thing I was thinking about earlier
[02:45:01] and you had mentioned scaffolding.
[02:45:03] And again, I think this goes with a lot of your work
[02:45:06] as my understanding of Jocko is this idea of,
[02:45:09] there is a need for external scaffolding.
[02:45:11] Like you said earlier, people like,
[02:45:12] do they like, they don't really want to be there.
[02:45:13] Nope, they don't.
[02:45:14] And in the beginning, that's totally fine.
[02:45:16] We're gonna like scaffold them up
[02:45:17] because internally they're kind of jiggly
[02:45:19] and not really set, right?
[02:45:22] So we're gonna hold them until things can kind of firm
[02:45:25] up a little bit and over time as they're building,
[02:45:28] we pull the external scaffolding back
[02:45:31] because what is happening theoretically is internally,
[02:45:34] their internal scaffolding is taking shape and taking hold.
[02:45:38] So it's very much about helping people access
[02:45:42] their own agency, their own strength, normalizing
[02:45:46] and saying, yep, I get it today.
[02:45:47] You know what, today is just a rough one.
[02:45:49] That's fine, nothing is wrong with you.
[02:45:51] We're just having one of those days
[02:45:52] and help them develop that internal confidence
[02:45:55] and agency of like self-management,
[02:45:57] even when you have an illness,
[02:45:59] even if you have PTSD, even if you lost your friend.
[02:46:02] Yeah, well, this is the title of the book
[02:46:04] that I wrote, Discipline Equals Freedom.
[02:46:06] It's the exact same thing, right?
[02:46:07] I mean, it's like you put the disciplines in your life
[02:46:11] around waking up, around sticking to a structure,
[02:46:14] around going to get groceries, around showering,
[02:46:18] which you mentioned in it.
[02:46:19] You mentioned it like very quickly,
[02:46:21] you said, I don't know, showering.
[02:46:22] You get people that aren't showering,
[02:46:24] that's an issue, right?
[02:46:26] So we gotta have the discipline to get up,
[02:46:28] to stay on a schedule, to eat good foods,
[02:46:30] to shower, to brush our teeth.
[02:46:33] And once we get that kind of scaffolding,
[02:46:35] that kind of discipline in place,
[02:46:37] then it becomes internally become self-discipline
[02:46:40] and now we can get more and more freedom as time goes on.
[02:46:43] Why are some good tactics, techniques and procedures
[02:46:47] for getting someone to want to help themselves?
[02:46:54] So I got a family member,
[02:46:56] they're not dealing with reality
[02:46:59] or they're starting to show some of these signs.
[02:47:02] What's a step to take that might be helpful?
[02:47:06] So like I have a book called Extreme Ownership
[02:47:08] and people would say, like,
[02:47:09] why do I get my boss to read it?
[02:47:10] And the worst thing you can do is go to the boss
[02:47:12] and say, hey boss, you need to read this book.
[02:47:14] So we say, oh, you go and say, hey boss,
[02:47:16] I read this book, it really helped me out a lot.
[02:47:18] I'm trying to hold myself to these standards.
[02:47:19] Can you just look at it and if you see me slipping,
[02:47:21] can you type me up?
[02:47:22] You know, a little indirect approach.
[02:47:24] Do you have any recommendations around what to do
[02:47:27] and maybe some recommendations of what not to do?
[02:47:30] Yeah, I mean, I think, for their example,
[02:47:33] consistency is huge and patience too,
[02:47:35] because oftentimes we want people to move
[02:47:37] at the level of our ability to tolerate
[02:47:40] what's going on for them.
[02:47:40] And it's very uncomfortable to see someone struggling.
[02:47:42] It's very uncomfortable to see someone so hopeless.
[02:47:44] You're hearing their narratives.
[02:47:46] You're like, where are you even thinking at?
[02:47:47] And often we want them to move faster
[02:47:49] than they're ready to move.
[02:47:51] But what you're describing with the framing around the book
[02:47:53] is we plant seeds.
[02:47:54] We create as much structure and consistency
[02:47:57] as we can.
[02:47:57] We plant seeds.
[02:47:58] We help people to kind of be thinking about
[02:48:01] and how this will impact them.
[02:48:03] But every day it's the sort of same conversation
[02:48:06] until they get it and sort of a loving approach with them
[02:48:08] until they get it and being able to tolerate
[02:48:11] what comes up for me when somebody isn't moving at the pace
[02:48:14] that I want them to.
[02:48:15] Because when we're talking about, you know,
[02:48:17] somebody who needs a little pick me up,
[02:48:19] that turnaround might be a lot quicker
[02:48:20] than somebody with a chronic sort of complex disorder.
[02:48:23] And in that case, like, it might take days or months
[02:48:27] before that person gets up and goes showers on their own.
[02:48:29] So can I deal with my own frustration, right?
[02:48:32] Can I deal with my own sense of like helplessness
[02:48:34] and like sense of powerlessness or even inadequacy
[02:48:37] and not being able to like shift?
[02:48:38] Like all these things come up for someone
[02:48:40] when you're loving somebody through something like this.
[02:48:43] But consistency is huge.
[02:48:45] And then remembering that you're not hurting someone
[02:48:47] by trying to hold them in their own discomfort, right?
[02:48:51] So if somebody is uncomfortable,
[02:48:52] but you're helping move them through something
[02:48:54] that's good for them, you're not hurting them.
[02:48:56] Actually, they're experiencing that discomfort
[02:48:58] is going to be really helpful for them.
[02:49:00] It's a very loving thing to do.
[02:49:01] It's a conversation I have with parents often
[02:49:03] about this notion of like hurting in some ways
[02:49:05] when my child is experiencing discomfort.
[02:49:07] No, in fact, like experiencing discomfort in this thing
[02:49:10] is actually really motivating.
[02:49:12] Yes, and amazing for them.
[02:49:14] And it's a super loving thing to do.
[02:49:19] Yeah, and I think it's important to, you know,
[02:49:22] when I talked about, oh, it's normal to go in like,
[02:49:25] hey, you're sad, that's normal.
[02:49:27] Hey, you feel down when you hear this song, that's normal.
[02:49:29] Hey, it's also normal if you've got a kid or a relative
[02:49:34] that's having some issues that you take them
[02:49:37] to the engine shop to get checked out
[02:49:39] and see what's going on.
[02:49:40] Like this is also a normal thing.
[02:49:42] So I think that's another stigma to punch through.
[02:49:46] Anything we should not do, any warnings like,
[02:49:49] hey, that's not a good approach
[02:49:52] when you're trying to get someone to help themselves?
[02:49:54] Well, I think like some of the examples you used earlier,
[02:49:58] and even like when the kids call and ask you questions
[02:50:00] is like the not the shaming stuff.
[02:50:02] Like you said, like, well, what a mom
[02:50:04] who is gonna say something like,
[02:50:05] like, well, why are you doing that?
[02:50:07] You're like, those kind of things aren't typically helpful.
[02:50:09] Cause you know, nobody wants to be ill.
[02:50:11] Nobody wants to have PTSD.
[02:50:12] Nobody wants to have these symptoms.
[02:50:14] So even on the surface, if it looks like,
[02:50:16] why on earth would you do that?
[02:50:19] They're not doing it to like be difficult or willful
[02:50:21] or to make themselves, you know, worse.
[02:50:24] So it's easy, it's part of the stigma
[02:50:26] to move into kind of a shaming.
[02:50:29] Why, why did you do that?
[02:50:31] Like that's ridiculous.
[02:50:33] Or you know better than that, like this kind of thing.
[02:50:36] But they, I mean, people will sink, right?
[02:50:38] They kind of cower and sink into that.
[02:50:40] And in some ways might even come to believe
[02:50:44] that I'm weak, I'm incapable, I'm stupid, I'm whatever,
[02:50:47] which is gonna suck the sense of agency.
[02:50:50] So encouragement, still tough luck.
[02:50:53] I mean, it's a blend of all these things.
[02:50:54] Like I'm gonna be kind and respectful,
[02:50:56] also a little bit firm, also let you know
[02:50:59] that I absolutely believe in you.
[02:51:01] And so we're gonna get up right now
[02:51:03] and we're gonna do this thing,
[02:51:03] even though I know you feel really sad.
[02:51:05] Yep.
[02:51:06] Well, and I would say to not disregard your own intuition,
[02:51:09] especially when we're talking about suicide,
[02:51:11] because there's such a,
[02:51:13] there's also could be a self stigma in some ways.
[02:51:15] And so if your intuition has you wondering about something
[02:51:18] or something seemed off with them,
[02:51:20] or oftentimes we can talk ourselves out of that,
[02:51:22] oh, we don't step in other people's business,
[02:51:24] that somebody else's kid,
[02:51:25] or it's not my place to do that,
[02:51:27] or you know, maybe if I bring this up,
[02:51:28] it'll make it worse for them, you know.
[02:51:30] And so I think trusting our intuition is huge
[02:51:32] if there's a pull in some ways to check in with somebody
[02:51:35] or ask them how they're doing,
[02:51:36] or you notice something that feels off,
[02:51:39] can't tell you how many times,
[02:51:40] especially when we're working in a peer supported environment,
[02:51:42] because we're trying to get folks,
[02:51:44] when we're bringing them into this like,
[02:51:46] housing and they're living together
[02:51:47] to sort of notice each other and take care of each other,
[02:51:49] create their own community and friendships.
[02:51:51] When we see something go kind of sideways with someone,
[02:51:54] or they regress significantly or something happens,
[02:51:56] and you start asking their peers
[02:51:57] sort of what was going on.
[02:51:58] Oftentimes they noticed something,
[02:52:01] but their intuition talked them out of it.
[02:52:02] They'll be mad at me if I hold them accountable.
[02:52:04] You know, I didn't tell everybody
[02:52:06] when I didn't see that they were up for meds
[02:52:07] because I didn't want to like kind of call them out
[02:52:10] or whatever it might be.
[02:52:11] And so I think that, you know,
[02:52:13] trusting our intuition with that
[02:52:14] and like really checking in with people
[02:52:16] and asking important questions,
[02:52:18] and working through our own fears
[02:52:19] that we have related to addressing some of these things
[02:52:22] are super important.
[02:52:23] Your example of like,
[02:52:25] like hey, that's like the fourth time
[02:52:26] you went to the bathroom, the last half an hour, right?
[02:52:28] Imagine like you were saying, if you hadn't said that,
[02:52:31] like what that person would have done in their head
[02:52:33] and how that would have,
[02:52:34] so I think one of the advice, like it's both is,
[02:52:37] say something, say something, call it out, ask a question.
[02:52:40] Hey, like, again, the person might say,
[02:52:41] oh, I'm good, I'm good, don't worry about it, okay.
[02:52:43] But at least you saw them
[02:52:45] and they experienced you seeing them.
[02:52:47] They saw that, you saw them.
[02:52:48] Versus like that blind eye,
[02:52:50] I mean, I think the turning the blind eye,
[02:52:52] not saying the thing, keeping the secrets,
[02:52:55] under the rug is the worst.
[02:52:57] Yeah.
[02:52:59] From a leadership perspective,
[02:53:00] I always often talk about asking Ernest questions
[02:53:02] and how that's a great indirect way
[02:53:04] to let people know that you are watching
[02:53:07] and that you're interested.
[02:53:09] And the key word is Ernest.
[02:53:11] It's not like, hey, I noticed, you've been sad lately.
[02:53:16] What's wrong with you?
[02:53:18] Which is an accusatory question,
[02:53:20] as opposed to being like,
[02:53:21] you know, hey, what are you doing this weekend?
[02:53:23] Like an Ernest question.
[02:53:25] That's an Ernest question, what are you doing this weekend?
[02:53:27] I'm not doing anything.
[02:53:27] Oh, well, what about next weekend?
[02:53:30] I'm not doing anything.
[02:53:31] Do you wanna do something?
[02:53:32] Like, do you wanna go catch a movie?
[02:53:34] You know, so like these kind of Ernest questions
[02:53:36] are a good way to interact with people
[02:53:39] without being accusatory.
[02:53:41] And they might be like, yeah, you know,
[02:53:43] I know I haven't been doing much lately
[02:53:44] because I've been sick for the last few weeks
[02:53:47] and I'm just gonna heal up and you go, okay, cool.
[02:53:49] In which case, cool.
[02:53:50] You can carry on.
[02:53:51] They saw you notice that.
[02:53:53] Yeah, we talk about it as being curious,
[02:53:55] as opposed to accusatory,
[02:53:56] as approaching everything with a certain level of curiosity.
[02:53:59] It'll take you a long way.
[02:54:01] That will do it.
[02:54:02] Megan, any closing thoughts?
[02:54:05] Thank you for having us be here.
[02:54:08] I'm extremely grateful to be a part of this.
[02:54:10] And yes, I mean, I think in terms of the work that we do,
[02:54:13] it takes a special type of person to be able,
[02:54:15] to have this conversation, to talk about this,
[02:54:17] to work with this population, to be a part of it.
[02:54:20] And you're definitely a part of that.
[02:54:22] So thank you.
[02:54:23] Glad to be here, Carla, or anything else?
[02:54:25] Same, thank you for your support.
[02:54:27] If anybody wants to find you,
[02:54:29] the latest and greatest, the new treatment center
[02:54:32] is called a new.
[02:54:34] It's a good play on words you did there.
[02:54:36] A new treatmentcenter.com.
[02:54:40] You're on Instagram, so you're on social media
[02:54:43] with some positivity.
[02:54:45] That's at a new treatment center.
[02:54:48] You're on Facebook, you're on LinkedIn,
[02:54:50] and you're on YouTube.
[02:54:51] You got your own little YouTube channel going on.
[02:54:53] I've been running.
[02:54:54] I'm a social media part, but I'm really glad
[02:54:56] that's happening.
[02:54:56] And all those are at a new treatment center.
[02:54:58] And I was thinking, you two should do a little podcast,
[02:55:02] by the way.
[02:55:03] I'm just gonna let you know that.
[02:55:04] You should do it.
[02:55:05] You should talk about some cases that you see
[02:55:08] because people will be interested in it.
[02:55:11] I think it would be very educational.
[02:55:13] And I know I was laughed because Joe Rogan told me
[02:55:17] to start a podcast.
[02:55:18] And at the time I was like, oh, that's pretty cool.
[02:55:21] And then you realize Joe Rogan literally
[02:55:23] had one point in time Joe Rogan told everyone
[02:55:25] on his podcast to start a podcast.
[02:55:27] Because he was super stoked on podcasting.
[02:55:29] Well, you knew he was gonna get it right in one way.
[02:55:31] And a bunch of people have started podcasts,
[02:55:33] but certainly him and Tim Ferriss both told me
[02:55:35] to start a podcast and I listened to him.
[02:55:36] But I think that if you broke it down
[02:55:39] and did some podcasts about some of the things
[02:55:41] that you see, I think it would really be helpful
[02:55:43] for people and would be cool.
[02:55:46] So there you go.
[02:55:47] That's my little recommendation.
[02:55:49] And thanks for joining us.
[02:55:51] Thanks for educating us.
[02:55:52] Thanks for trying to educate me.
[02:55:53] I know it can be challenging sometimes.
[02:55:56] Megan, of course, thanks for your service in the Navy.
[02:55:58] And thanks to both of you for what you're doing today
[02:56:02] to help heal people, help get people to a point
[02:56:04] where they can live productive and happy lives.
[02:56:09] And by the way, if there's any one out there right now
[02:56:12] that's listening, you might not feel great today.
[02:56:17] And you might need to bring the car into the shop
[02:56:24] and get that thing looked at
[02:56:26] and figure out what's going on.
[02:56:28] Nothing wrong with it.
[02:56:29] It's gonna make you better.
[02:56:31] Thanks for doing that, both of you.
[02:56:33] Thank you.
[02:56:34] Appreciate it.
[02:56:36] And with that, Megan and Karlyn have left the building
[02:56:40] and Echo Charles has returned.
[02:56:42] Good evening, Echo.
[02:56:43] Good evening.
[02:56:44] So you were sitting there listening.
[02:56:46] Yes.
[02:56:47] You've been taking the, what, the kind of off-camera
[02:56:52] approach last two podcasts.
[02:56:54] You've been sitting there observing detached.
[02:56:57] Lot going on there, isn't there?
[02:56:58] Yes.
[02:56:59] Lot going on in the mental health world.
[02:57:03] Yeah.
[02:57:05] Yeah, it's really, it's like a slippery scenario, right?
[02:57:07] Because just like how you get, it's a spectrum.
[02:57:09] It's not like, oh, you're the, you know, like you,
[02:57:13] compared to your body.
[02:57:14] So if you break your arm.
[02:57:16] Yeah.
[02:57:16] It's like, oh yeah, a broken arm.
[02:57:17] Yeah.
[02:57:18] Or maybe you got a fractured arm.
[02:57:19] Mm-hmm.
[02:57:20] And that's sort of, it's kind of a distinct thing.
[02:57:22] Well, a fractured protocol.
[02:57:24] Broken, stress fracture.
[02:57:25] Okay.
[02:57:26] A spiral fracture.
[02:57:27] Okay.
[02:57:28] You know, kind of a thing.
[02:57:29] Pretty limited.
[02:57:30] Like as far as a bone break, you're kind of,
[02:57:35] there's a pretty specific protocol you're gonna follow.
[02:57:37] Hand full of things.
[02:57:38] It's pretty easy to diagnose, right?
[02:57:39] The spectrum isn't this weird, it's the, you know,
[02:57:42] there's guards of gray, you know?
[02:57:44] This bone compound fracture or whatever.
[02:57:46] Like there's some differences.
[02:57:47] Oh yeah.
[02:57:47] But we know that a broken bone is a broken bone.
[02:57:49] Here's how we fix it.
[02:57:50] Yeah.
[02:57:51] And then that's not, okay.
[02:57:52] Then compared to the mental part where it's like,
[02:57:54] it's just, it's, it's this spectrum
[02:57:56] and you can fall anywhere on the spectrum.
[02:57:58] By the way, you do fall on.
[02:57:59] Like we all fall on.
[02:58:00] That's what makes it even double.
[02:58:01] That's what makes it interesting.
[02:58:02] That's what really, that's part of what makes it interesting
[02:58:05] to me is like, oh, you're a little bit of a narcissist.
[02:58:08] I'm a little bit of a narcissist.
[02:58:09] I'm a little bit paranoid.
[02:58:10] You're a little bit paranoid.
[02:58:11] How paranoid are you?
[02:58:13] Are you good paranoid?
[02:58:14] Cause there's a certain level of paranoia.
[02:58:15] Like someone that's not paranoid at all
[02:58:17] is just like going through life.
[02:58:18] They can just get taken advantage of.
[02:58:19] You gotta be somewhat paranoid.
[02:58:20] Yeah.
[02:58:21] Delusion.
[02:58:22] So just like the dichotomy of leadership,
[02:58:23] like the dichotomy of your mental status
[02:58:28] is has to be balanced.
[02:58:30] Yeah.
[02:58:31] And that's so, it makes it so clear how helpful it is
[02:58:35] to understand and inversely kind of to express that,
[02:58:40] to people who might be in a certain situation
[02:58:42] that like, hey, that's, that's normal.
[02:58:45] Like there's nothing quote unquote wrong.
[02:58:46] That's normal, you know?
[02:58:48] And so, and that's what makes it even harder to,
[02:58:51] where it's like this bad thing,
[02:58:53] this thing that I don't want, you know,
[02:58:54] like you break your arm, something that you hurt,
[02:58:56] your arm will say, you hurt before you go to the doctor
[02:58:58] or whatever, you know something's wrong.
[02:59:00] Like this thing is hurting.
[02:59:01] It's not getting better, whatever.
[02:59:03] Let me go to, I know something's wrong.
[02:59:05] So mentally you're gonna feel sad for two days
[02:59:07] or whatever you feel you have these feelings for two days
[02:59:09] that are normal.
[02:59:11] So it's like harder to, you know, after a while,
[02:59:13] it's like maybe if I'm behaving in a certain way,
[02:59:15] it's like certain symptoms have to kind of arrive
[02:59:17] or arise along with the feeling.
[02:59:21] And it's all like, and if you don't know, you don't know,
[02:59:22] you know, so it's like just so slippery like that.
[02:59:24] I took down a note during the catch 22,
[02:59:27] which basically means cause even with, with,
[02:59:32] Marcus and Amber on the last podcast,
[02:59:34] I was kind of like, you know, I feel fine and like,
[02:59:36] I don't think I need anything, right?
[02:59:37] Someone's telling them.
[02:59:38] And then these guys show up today,
[02:59:40] these girls show up today, these women show up today.
[02:59:42] And I kind of tell them the same thing, you know,
[02:59:44] before we get in here, I'm like, you know,
[02:59:46] I feel like, you know, I'm fine.
[02:59:47] But then one of the, one of the like notifications
[02:59:52] of when you're crazy is when you don't think you're crazy.
[02:59:54] Right?
[02:59:55] So I'm like, oh, I'm that guy that doesn't think he's crazy,
[02:59:57] but I'm actually totally crazy.
[02:59:59] So I thought that was kind of funny
[03:00:01] as I was thinking through that.
[03:00:02] I was like, wait a second, I'm the guy that's in here.
[03:00:04] I'm fine, but I'm actually crazy.
[03:00:06] Yeah.
[03:00:07] Oh yeah.
[03:00:08] So gotta watch out for that one.
[03:00:09] Yes.
[03:00:10] And we all know people, maybe not a lot,
[03:00:12] but we know people who are like,
[03:00:15] they obviously routinely do things that are just,
[03:00:19] you shouldn't be doing that.
[03:00:21] And they're like, no, no, no, I'm fine.
[03:00:22] I'm fine.
[03:00:23] I'm absolutely fine.
[03:00:24] So you're like, man, am I that guy?
[03:00:26] Just not knowing all the things that I'm doing
[03:00:28] that's not fine, you know?
[03:00:31] So gotta watch out for it.
[03:00:33] But what a, what a fascinating world.
[03:00:37] And as I was doing research for that part,
[03:00:39] and we only got to so much.
[03:00:40] I mean, there's so every one of these things,
[03:00:42] when you open it up, I mean,
[03:00:45] there's a story in like a whole world behind being paranoid.
[03:00:51] And what a really paranoid, or being anorexic.
[03:00:54] What a real, what that looks like.
[03:00:55] Like there's a whole world behind each one of these.
[03:00:57] That's what's interesting, like compared to,
[03:01:02] you know, an orthopedic surgeon.
[03:01:03] Like sure, there's a bunch of different things
[03:01:04] that can go on with a broken arm or with whatever, right?
[03:01:07] But, you know, this is just wildness, you know?
[03:01:12] It's wildness.
[03:01:13] And you remember how you, a long time ago on the podcast,
[03:01:16] you said working out is like the one thing that you can do
[03:01:19] that will positively impact everything that you do.
[03:01:21] I feel that that proved to be right.
[03:01:22] But what's interesting is,
[03:01:25] having a broken arm is gonna impact some parts of your life,
[03:01:29] but it's not gonna impact like everything.
[03:01:32] But if you have some kind of a mental health issue,
[03:01:35] it's like everything is gonna be impacted.
[03:01:39] And again, it's a spectrum where it's like,
[03:01:42] oh, you know what, now I'm kind of like,
[03:01:45] I don't go out as much.
[03:01:46] Cool, that's no big deal, right?
[03:01:49] But then where does it go?
[03:01:50] Like does it, I don't go out much to,
[03:01:52] hey, I'm not gonna go,
[03:01:54] I'm not gonna go to the grocery store,
[03:01:56] to I'm gonna have people drop my food
[03:01:59] at the end of the hallway, to I'm just gonna sit in here
[03:02:02] and like not eat.
[03:02:03] Like it's just, it's very strange.
[03:02:07] And the other thing that I find interesting is just how,
[03:02:12] when I talked to him about how I had said in the academy,
[03:02:15] like we're all insane.
[03:02:16] Everyone's insane, cause your version of reality
[03:02:19] is different than my version of reality.
[03:02:20] And by the way, neither your version or my version
[03:02:22] is actually correct.
[03:02:24] Like what your perception is is not 100% correct,
[03:02:27] my perception is not 100% correct.
[03:02:29] We hope that you and I have a big overlap.
[03:02:32] Like we hope that we have a big, huge overlap.
[03:02:34] And there's like a little bit that I think
[03:02:35] is a little different, a little bit, but that's what we hope.
[03:02:37] And we hope that with most people in our lives,
[03:02:39] most of it is relatively close.
[03:02:42] But the fact is, and also, the fact is
[03:02:46] they're not gonna be perfect and different people.
[03:02:48] Like you can go meet someone today.
[03:02:50] You and I have 97% overlap.
[03:02:53] We can go talk to someone right now
[03:02:54] that we only overlap like 20 or 30% of reality.
[03:02:58] Their reality is just different.
[03:03:00] And that's a real thing.
[03:03:02] That's reality.
[03:03:04] So, it's mayhem out there.
[03:03:07] It is mayhem out there, it's crazy man.
[03:03:09] It's crazy because of how they shed such a clear light
[03:03:12] on how it really works.
[03:03:13] And it's like, man, all this is going on right now.
[03:03:15] Like in my head, in this person,
[03:03:17] in everyone's head around us.
[03:03:18] Holy cow.
[03:03:19] And she'll mention like, or,
[03:03:22] they'll mention like certain things, right?
[03:03:24] Where it reminds you that, hey,
[03:03:27] I didn't really think about this.
[03:03:29] Where like going out, going outside, right?
[03:03:31] I think actually you said it.
[03:03:33] Get outside.
[03:03:35] And not just outside the building,
[03:03:37] I mean, I think anyway, outside and talk to people.
[03:03:40] Talk to different people, be around different people.
[03:03:42] Cause you know, now a lot of my work, quote unquote,
[03:03:45] work is inside in front of the computer
[03:03:48] for long periods of time.
[03:03:49] So then I remember, not recently,
[03:03:51] but this was like years ago,
[03:03:52] where I remember not going outside for a few days.
[03:03:55] Like not going outside of the building in a few days.
[03:03:58] That's not healthy.
[03:03:58] Yeah. And you can feel it too.
[03:04:00] Like after a while, when you kind of are in touch with it,
[03:04:02] like you can feel it.
[03:04:03] Or not used, not, or being, not used to being around people.
[03:04:09] When, okay, I used to work in nightclub
[03:04:10] where you're around people all the time.
[03:04:12] All different dynamic spectrum of people all the time.
[03:04:16] Positive negative everybody.
[03:04:19] And then, you know, working inside
[03:04:21] where you're not around a lot of people.
[03:04:23] Like I can totally tell the difference.
[03:04:24] Like the idea of me,
[03:04:25] and this might have to do with age too, by the way,
[03:04:27] but the idea of going down
[03:04:30] and dealing with the crowd of a nightclub or something.
[03:04:32] Doesn't appeal to you.
[03:04:33] On any night is like,
[03:04:35] that is one of the last things I'd want to do.
[03:04:37] And then when I compare,
[03:04:38] especially when I compare it to like,
[03:04:39] how I was kind of down with that long time ago, you know?
[03:04:42] And so you take that idea and do it
[03:04:44] and just apply it to everyday life.
[03:04:45] I know nightclub and all that stuff is different,
[03:04:47] little bit different.
[03:04:48] But in everyday life,
[03:04:49] if you're used to going out to the store
[03:04:50] or going out to this and that,
[03:04:52] and then you don't go outside for a long time,
[03:04:55] or you just simply alone,
[03:04:56] you just don't go outside for a long time.
[03:04:59] Starting to go outside and dealing with like people
[03:05:01] or the public becomes more and more challenging,
[03:05:04] just cause you're not used to it,
[03:05:05] just like any kind of exercise you do.
[03:05:07] So I'm saying,
[03:05:08] and I can understand even more now.
[03:05:12] How that window shuts.
[03:05:14] Yeah, and how that can jam you up mentally.
[03:05:17] It doesn't seem like you're made for that kind of stuff.
[03:05:19] You know, just being isolated.
[03:05:21] And then you're stuck with the internet all the time.
[03:05:23] Oh man, brother, brother, you gotta watch out.
[03:05:25] You see that internet conversation
[03:05:26] could be a five hour conversation.
[03:05:27] Oh yeah.
[03:05:28] Cause it's mayhem out there on the internet.
[03:05:31] And if you have that little belief,
[03:05:33] I mean, look, if you believe that veganism
[03:05:39] is the best thing for you,
[03:05:41] that you can go insane.
[03:05:42] If you believe that the carnivore died
[03:05:45] is about you can go insane.
[03:05:46] If you believe like whatever weird belief
[03:05:49] that you wanna have,
[03:05:50] and you wanna jump on the internet
[03:05:51] and you wanna read into that thing.
[03:05:53] Bruh.
[03:05:54] You gotta watch out, man.
[03:06:00] Don't get off that internet, man.
[03:06:02] It's gonna jack you up.
[03:06:04] And the weird thing is when I tell you,
[03:06:06] if I'm like, echo dude, you gotta get off the internet.
[03:06:08] You gotta stop reading about, you know, carnivore diet.
[03:06:12] You be like, oh, you just want me to keep eating
[03:06:13] the mainstream diet.
[03:06:15] It's like that, you see?
[03:06:16] It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[03:06:20] So you gotta get yourself out of the algorithm.
[03:06:23] Just watch out.
[03:06:24] Hey, that being said, one thing that we did talk about today
[03:06:29] was being healthy, eating the right foods, working out.
[03:06:35] This is coming from two people in the industry
[03:06:37] for a quarter, well, between them,
[03:06:39] it's probably, I don't know, 50 years or something.
[03:06:41] They got a lot of experience in this industry.
[03:06:43] And I made fun of Rogan and me saying like,
[03:06:48] oh, you should work out.
[03:06:50] I kinda made fun of it.
[03:06:51] And they're like, actually, it's true.
[03:06:53] Work out, eat right, stay on the path.
[03:06:56] It's gonna help you in everything that you do.
[03:06:58] So get yourself some good, let's say, supplementation.
[03:07:02] Yes, to help with that work out.
[03:07:04] And that's the thing, actually,
[03:07:05] you're probably in this boat too, where you-
[03:07:06] Segway just occurred.
[03:07:07] You're welcome, everybody.
[03:07:09] Yeah, that's the perfect chance.
[03:07:12] But you probably like this too,
[03:07:13] where you pretty much worked out your whole life,
[03:07:15] probably, right?
[03:07:16] Yeah, I really didn't start legitimately working out
[03:07:20] until I was like,
[03:07:21] first of all, because working out wasn't really a thing.
[03:07:25] I mean, it really wasn't.
[03:07:26] Like, there was no, I'm one of my five years older than you.
[03:07:29] So like, yes, did we have Joe Weider's
[03:07:34] superweight gain back in like 1985?
[03:07:36] Yes, we did.
[03:07:37] But we didn't understand, at least where I was.
[03:07:40] I mean, look, maybe if I'd have been at some bigger school,
[03:07:45] cause I was in like a little school,
[03:07:46] like there was a YMCA and there was a,
[03:07:48] there was bumper plates in there.
[03:07:49] But like, I had no idea what.
[03:07:51] I remember there was a blind guy
[03:07:54] that would Olympic lift.
[03:07:56] And I actually thought at the time it was cause,
[03:07:59] like that was what he was limited to.
[03:08:02] I thought, well, you know, he can't really see,
[03:08:04] so he just stays in this one spot and just lifts that one bar.
[03:08:07] He doesn't know how to use the freaking peck deck.
[03:08:11] You know what I'm saying?
[03:08:12] So yes, I guess I have been working out for a while.
[03:08:14] Yeah.
[03:08:15] So we, and so you weren't like a jock.
[03:08:19] You were a jock-o, but you were just.
[03:08:20] I definitely was not like a jock,
[03:08:22] although I played soccer and basketball.
[03:08:26] Every year.
[03:08:27] Yep.
[03:08:27] Oh, okay.
[03:08:28] So yeah, yeah.
[03:08:29] So to me, that is working out.
[03:08:31] So, especially if you took it even this much seriously.
[03:08:33] So consider, and I'll use myself as an example.
[03:08:36] So when I was 11 years old, I started actual sports.
[03:08:40] So you play football.
[03:08:42] But you got into push-ups, right?
[03:08:43] I remember you.
[03:08:44] Push-ups.
[03:08:44] And so I always thought that having big muscles was cool.
[03:08:46] Yes.
[03:08:47] So, so I would do that kind of stuff.
[03:08:49] Yes, for sure.
[03:08:50] When you reach puberty, 13, 14,
[03:08:52] probably like 15 years old, we started lifting weights.
[03:08:55] So, man, from there, it was on.
[03:08:58] It was all one big program indefinitely.
[03:09:00] Till now.
[03:09:02] Till literally right now today.
[03:09:03] Till this morning.
[03:09:04] Yes, sir.
[03:09:05] Yes.
[03:09:06] So, and this is how it works.
[03:09:08] Essentially, if you care about sports,
[03:09:09] care about your performance in sports, which we did.
[03:09:11] So you go on season, obviously you're practicing every day,
[03:09:14] football and track, that's what we did.
[03:09:16] So football is one season,
[03:09:17] once football is over, get ready for track.
[03:09:20] Between that set, you're lifting weight.
[03:09:22] So yeah, you're just going from one sport
[03:09:25] to lifting and conditioning to the next sport,
[03:09:27] lifting and conditioning, and back and forth years
[03:09:29] through college.
[03:09:31] And then after college, it was just lifting.
[03:09:34] And then when I got into Jiu-Jitsu,
[03:09:35] okay, now it's lifting and conditioning for Jiu-Jitsu,
[03:09:37] tournaments, all this stuff.
[03:09:39] So essentially being on the program,
[03:09:42] on the path from a physical standpoint,
[03:09:43] is has been.
[03:09:44] In the long term, decades.
[03:09:45] Yeah, but as a result, it is served as like an anchor.
[03:09:50] So, you know, the idea of like not working out.
[03:09:54] It's not a thing.
[03:09:55] Like, oh, he just quit working out.
[03:09:57] Like, bro, man, it's hard to relate,
[03:09:59] even though it's so common.
[03:10:02] So yeah, I think if you can anchor that, the workout,
[03:10:06] like my physical health is like an anchor, a given.
[03:10:10] And it should be,
[03:10:11] because if your physical health falls apart,
[03:10:13] like it's gonna negatively impact everything else.
[03:10:16] Now look, you can get sick, and guess what?
[03:10:18] When you do get sick, if you get sick,
[03:10:20] it is still gonna negatively impact everything else.
[03:10:23] But there's sicknesses you don't have an option on, right?
[03:10:26] Like you get hit with some horrible cancer out of nowhere.
[03:10:29] Like what are you gonna do about that?
[03:10:31] Well, you know, you go through the protocol,
[03:10:32] you try and stay positive.
[03:10:34] But a lot of people,
[03:10:36] they don't get hit with something they can't control.
[03:10:38] They get hit with the one thing they can control.
[03:10:42] And they let it slide, which is freaking horrible to see.
[03:10:46] So let's not let it slide.
[03:10:48] Yep, get on there.
[03:10:50] And yeah, take your supplements.
[03:10:51] That helps it.
[03:10:52] That helps the physical part.
[03:10:53] So you're saying, Joc,
[03:10:54] cause these goods are functional.
[03:10:56] This is the line of supplements I wish I always had.
[03:10:58] Yeah.
[03:10:59] That could have been a game changer actually.
[03:11:01] If we were to have these supplements our whole lives.
[03:11:04] Yeah.
[03:11:05] A whole different story.
[03:11:05] A whole different story.
[03:11:07] Let's face it, we navigate our supplement experience
[03:11:10] very ignorantly.
[03:11:11] You know, the best advertisement wins straight up.
[03:11:14] Like, hey, you see a buff guy on there
[03:11:16] saying freaking 100 grams of protein first scoop.
[03:11:18] You see a guy that's freaking juiced to the absolute gills.
[03:11:22] Yes.
[03:11:23] Oh yeah.
[03:11:24] And you know, so that's, that's all we're gonna get.
[03:11:26] And he's like, yeah.
[03:11:27] I take Frank and whatever.
[03:11:30] And they come up with these crazy days.
[03:11:32] Mega mass, I forget the number.
[03:11:34] I think it was 5,000.
[03:11:36] Mega, brother, that tasted kind of good.
[03:11:38] It was in a big dog food bag.
[03:11:39] It was a food bag.
[03:11:41] For weight gain, mega mass 5,000.
[03:11:42] Like just get some.
[03:11:43] Oh yeah.
[03:11:43] And that's, but so yeah.
[03:11:45] Now we know, Brad, it's not like that.
[03:11:47] You gotta take the correct stuff,
[03:11:48] made with the correct stuff, for the correct stuff.
[03:11:52] So yeah, we're doing that.
[03:11:53] We got joint stuff.
[03:11:55] Mulk, which is the protein.
[03:11:56] That's the protein we should have had back in the day.
[03:11:59] Not this mega sugar, one million or whatever it was before.
[03:12:02] It seemed to me.
[03:12:03] The energy drinks, Jocco, Go.
[03:12:06] Yep.
[03:12:07] The first, maybe not the first.
[03:12:08] I don't know.
[03:12:09] I have no idea.
[03:12:10] Fully healthy energy drink.

[03:12:21] It does.
[03:12:22] Well, one third of it, same saying.
[03:12:23] One third.
[03:12:24] Nutrition, exercise, rest.
[03:12:26] That's the trio.

[03:14:05] Don't forget that we, don't we have a store?
[03:14:07] We do have a store.
[03:14:08] And what's that called?
[03:14:09] It's called Jocco Store.
[03:14:10] Again, the discipline equals freedom standard issue.
[03:14:14] T-shirt is out.
[03:14:15] We made the announcement.
[03:14:16] Made it yesterday to the people and you know, good response.
[03:14:20] It's a good, it's a good standard issue shirt.
[03:14:22] I saw you put a YouTube video up of the shirt locker.
[03:14:25] Yeah, kinda updated.
[03:14:27] Oh, is it an updated one?
[03:14:28] A little bit, yeah.
[03:14:30] It's pretty cool, quite frankly.
[03:14:31] Yeah, it's a metaphorical, it's metaphorical.
[03:14:35] It's a metaphor for the shirt locker.
[03:14:39] Oh, cause my shirt's changing?
[03:14:40] Yeah, you know, people, I read the comments.
[03:14:42] That's not the deepest metaphor.
[03:14:45] I read some of the comments, they're like,
[03:14:46] oh, how do you make a shirt change
[03:14:48] when you didn't even take it off or whatever.
[03:14:49] See what I'm saying?
[03:14:50] So I'm saying, hey, it's a metaphor.
[03:14:51] It's a metaphor.
[03:14:52] You wear a shirt, it changes every month.
[03:14:56] Boom.
[03:14:57] It doesn't really change on your body
[03:14:58] the way it does in the video, see what I'm saying?
[03:15:00] You're wearing one of these shirt locker shirts right now.
[03:15:02] Is that right?
[03:15:03] Yes, yeah, it is.
[03:15:04] The G.I. Joe one.
[03:15:05] G.I. Joe rip.
[03:15:06] Most recent one is called toxic productivity.
[03:15:09] It's a good one.
[03:15:11] It's a good one, very good.
[03:15:13] These cartoonish pictures that you're utilizing of me,
[03:15:17] by the way.
[03:15:18] Cartoonish pictures of me.
[03:15:20] Comic book.
[03:15:21] Comic book pictures of me.
[03:15:23] Like holding a weapon in each hand,
[03:15:27] riding a tank.
[03:15:32] That's funny stuff.
[03:15:33] Yeah, there's actually a lot of good designs on there.
[03:15:37] I don't know if they come up for.
[03:15:39] Sometimes people request certain types of designs.
[03:15:43] We go down a rabbit hole looking into it,
[03:15:45] the viability of certain ones.
[03:15:46] And some of them is just real obvious
[03:15:48] that just need to be made into shirts.
[03:15:50] So, but it's fun.
[03:15:52] Anyway, that's called the shirt locker.
[03:15:54] One shirt, a new shirt every month.
[03:15:56] Cool thing, people seem to like it.

[03:16:15] Yes, we do.

[03:16:21] that they had to get fact checked.
[03:16:24] Oh yeah.
