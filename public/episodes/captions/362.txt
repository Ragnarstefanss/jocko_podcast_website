[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 362 with echo Charles and me.
[00:00:03] Jocko willing. Good evening echo. Good evening.
[00:00:06] So I was an officer candidate school.
[00:00:09] 1998. It's a form of military indoctrination. I was already in the military. I had already
[00:00:16] been indoctrinated in the military. So as I was going through it, I could kind of
[00:00:21] I was a little bit more detached. You know, I could see a little bit more,
[00:00:24] had a little bit more experience. And there's all kinds of procedures and protocols that you
[00:00:29] have to follow when you're going to officer candidate school. You got to you got to fold your
[00:00:34] underwear into a five inch by five inch square for a locker inspection. You've got to they come
[00:00:40] and measure it with a steel ruler, the drill instructors, Marine Corps drill instructors,
[00:00:44] they have a they have like their own personal, you know, some somebody has a possession that
[00:00:49] you can see it kind of has a certain level of pride to it. They would have these steel rulers
[00:00:53] and slap it down on that thing. And they're going to measure your handkerchief and your t-shirts and
[00:00:59] all this stuff. And it's about attention to detail, which is cool about protocols, learning protocols,
[00:01:05] and inspecting each other. So as a team, so you might check my locker and we're trying to help
[00:01:10] each other out. But one thing that always stuck stuck with me on the protocol level was the belt
[00:01:15] buckle that you had. So you could issue this belt buckle. And this belt buckle when you could
[00:01:20] issued it, it's shiny gold. And it's it's shiny gold. It's probably brass, actually. But then there's
[00:01:28] a clear enamel coat on it. And what that means is you can buy this thing. And it won't just tarnish
[00:01:35] because it's got this really strong, clear enamel coat on it's very thin. But that's what keeps it
[00:01:42] from tarnishing. But you can still get fingerprints on the enamel. So you could have a belt buckle
[00:01:48] that has like a fingerprint on it or a smudge on it. So you would wipe them off you, you kind of like
[00:01:53] wipe down your your belt buckle. Now here's the thing. At some point, this had evolved to where
[00:02:02] you would take your belt buckle that had this enamel on it. And you would polish it
[00:02:08] until the enamel was gone. And so now it could tarnish. So you remove the protective layer
[00:02:15] so that it could tarnish. So something that started as a good idea, which is you buff the
[00:02:19] belt buckle so there's no fingerprints on it escalated over time to where you were polishing this
[00:02:26] thing until all the enamel was removed. And now it would tarnish more easily. And it's actually
[00:02:32] hard to take care of now. So this this thing that started with good intent, oh, you're going to
[00:02:38] make sure there's no fingerprints on it turned into craziness. And people, no one knows where it
[00:02:45] started. Like no one knows when it got stupid. And no one knows we ended up when we ended up
[00:02:52] at Officer Candidate School making people do something stupid, but we did it. And this can
[00:02:58] happen with anything. Now there's a there's a similar term in or I shouldn't say in a similar
[00:03:05] situation, there's a term in political discourse called the Overton window. The Overton window,
[00:03:11] which was this is originated this term was originated by a guy that was named Joseph
[00:03:15] Overton, who is a political scientist and like a libertarian type dude. And he actually died
[00:03:24] flying an ultralight at age 43. But this idea of the Overton window is that there's a there's a
[00:03:31] window in the acceptance of ideas. So ideas go through a transition. So let's say there's an
[00:03:40] idea out there, it starts off when the idea first comes to light, it's totally unthinkable,
[00:03:46] totally unthinkable, meaning totally unacceptable. And then it actually, as people talk about it
[00:03:53] more and it becomes more familiar, it goes from being unthinkable, or totally unacceptable,
[00:03:59] to just radical. Like so you're not saying, Oh, that's unacceptable. You just saying, Oh,
[00:04:03] that's that's pretty radical. And then eventually it moves to being like a fringe idea. But now
[00:04:09] it's moving into the acceptable category. Then eventually it becomes acceptable. And then it
[00:04:16] becomes sensible. And then it becomes popular. And then it eventually becomes policy.
[00:04:22] And there's a bunch of things that kind of we've watched go through this evolution. I mean tattoos,
[00:04:28] right tattoos years ago tattoos were kind of unacceptable in normal society. It was like bikers.
[00:04:38] Bikers had tattoos and and convicts had tattoos. It wasn't normal. Now the tattoos are basically
[00:04:46] totally acceptable. Long hair for men, which I don't support. But but hey, but long hair for men
[00:04:56] in the 1940s totally unacceptable. In the 1950s and 60s, it was in the 50s, it was like radical.
[00:05:04] In the 60s, it was like kind of normal. Now it's just acceptable. So as people push the envelope
[00:05:17] with behavior, the Overton window expands and things become more acceptable and norms change
[00:05:22] over time. And it's also true that as one part of the Overton window opens another part closes. So
[00:05:30] if you are firing someone because they had a tattoo or you fired someone because they had
[00:05:35] long hair, now that would be unacceptable. The guy had long hair, you can't just fire someone
[00:05:40] because they have long hair that would be unacceptable now. So what am I talking about?
[00:05:46] How do these two things relate the belt buckle in the Overton window? Well,
[00:05:51] it certainly seems to me that as we look at the way society is evolving today,
[00:05:58] the Overton window of what's acceptable has expanded and moved so much that
[00:06:10] it might not make sense anymore. What some things that are now not only acceptable, but now sort
[00:06:17] of getting pushed, you wonder if they're if they make sense and maybe they could actually even be
[00:06:21] harmful. And I think if we if we as people aren't careful, we can kind of slowly drift around inside
[00:06:34] that Overton window from the positive of having an open mind to to an extreme to where there's no
[00:06:44] more guardrails. There's no more framework and there's no more baseline of what's acceptable
[00:06:48] and what's isn't. So a friend of mine, it seems to me has been trying to maintain some kind of
[00:06:58] sanity, some kind of rationality to the expansion of the Overton window to apply some baseline to
[00:07:05] the world. And I think it's been a pretty good fight for her. I think she's just getting warmed up.
[00:07:11] She's a former congresswoman. She's a former presidential candidate. She's an army officer.
[00:07:16] Iraq war veteran, podcaster, surfer, martial artist and Hawaiian. She's been on this podcast before
[00:07:26] episode 272. Her name is Tulsi Gabbard. And it's an honor to have her back with us tonight. Tulsi
[00:07:32] Gabbard. Aloha. How's it going? There's been a lot of there's been a lot going on in your world.
[00:07:41] Yeah. It's been crazy. It's been kind of crazy to watch when you came on this podcast for the first
[00:07:46] time. You were a democratic. I don't know if you were running for president. Were you running for
[00:07:53] president at the time? I think if I'm not mistaken, this was in late 2020. I don't know. I should
[00:08:01] have checked the dates. And so I think the if I'm not mistaken, I think the presidential campaign
[00:08:08] was finished at that point in time. And we were talking about how it went. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
[00:08:13] it's it's always interesting to me because I have some of my friends are dope smoke dope smoking
[00:08:19] hippies. Some of them are right wing conservative fundamentalist Christians and everything in
[00:08:25] between. And when you came on my podcast, you know, some of the the first time you came on the
[00:08:31] some of my super conservative friends were like, yo, why are you giving her a platform? I was like,
[00:08:37] oh, because she's cool and I like her. And then some of my dope smoking hippie friends were like,
[00:08:42] hell, yeah, that's what we're talking about. So you, you know, you you had sort of a,
[00:08:50] I think you had a reputation or an image, I think. And you more than that, I think you just get
[00:08:55] categorized, right? You were a Democrat at the time, which I know you aren't. Yeah. So what
[00:09:02] happened, man? What happened? Let's just talk about that. So you left the Democratic Party.
[00:09:06] Yeah. Well, first of all, just say, for as long as I've been in politics, people who like to put
[00:09:15] other humans in categories have always had trouble putting me in a category, just because I've always
[00:09:21] been a very independent minded person. So, you know, I first ran for office in 2002 in Hawaii.
[00:09:28] I was 21 years old, very passionate about environmental issues and protecting the beauty
[00:09:32] of our home in Hawaii, the water, oceans, and, and that was my motivation to run for a state house.
[00:09:39] And, you know, prior to that point, I had no, like familial political affiliation. There was no,
[00:09:46] like, you know, my daddy and granddaddy were Democrats. So I have to be a Democrat. My parents
[00:09:50] were very like, Hey, you, you go make your own decisions, figure out, you know, what, what is
[00:09:56] your foundational principles? And so at that time, I really had to look because I had, you know,
[00:10:03] filed a piece of paper saying I'm running for office and there was a box to check like, okay,
[00:10:06] fine, what party are you going to run under? And so I started looking at kind of the origins of,
[00:10:12] in Hawaii, the Democratic Party, Hawaii had been under the rule of a few very wealthy Republicans
[00:10:20] since it became a territory of the United States and then later through statehood.
[00:10:24] And the shift towards Democratic politics in Hawaii came about because
[00:10:30] of plantation workers, people who were being treated like crap, like in, in in humane conditions,
[00:10:38] being paid pennies for working super long hours. It was, it was basically like glorified slave labor.
[00:10:46] And so it was the Democratic Party and the ILWU that came in and was like, no, this is not okay.
[00:10:51] And, and so it was the party that in our history in Hawaii was the Big 10 inclusive party. It was
[00:10:57] the party for the people. It was the party that stood up against those few very wealthy people
[00:11:03] in power and said, no, you can't just abuse people like this. It was the party that stood for
[00:11:09] civil liberties and individual freedom and choice like, Hey, whatever your personal choice is,
[00:11:13] whether it's free speech or freedom of religion or whatever it is, like, live and let live,
[00:11:18] we can disagree without being disagreeable. And so I looked at the party in Hawaii and I looked
[00:11:22] at leaders like JFK and Dr. Martin Luther King and I was drawn to the Democratic Party for those
[00:11:28] reasons because again, and my, as I looked at Hawaii as like these super rich Republican dudes
[00:11:33] have been abusing their power to fill their pockets at the expense of the wellbeing of the people.
[00:11:40] And so fast forward, I left the Democrat Party because all of those things that I just talked
[00:11:47] about are gone. The leaders of today's Democratic Party don't believe in really individual freedom,
[00:11:56] basically what it comes down to. And you look at that freedom of choice, freedom of speech,
[00:12:01] freedom of religion, and you know, there's a lot of other issues that I could get into. But
[00:12:08] ultimately, how do you have a political party that's in power that doesn't believe in freedom and is
[00:12:17] actively taking action to undermine our constitution and Bill of Rights? And that was really what was
[00:12:23] at the crux of Y-Left, the Democrat Party. Was there a straw that broke the camel's back?
[00:12:31] There wasn't one single moment, but it was really over the last like few years, two,
[00:12:37] three years seeing this increasing, like quickly escalating towards policies coming from our
[00:12:49] government that really frankly, we're becoming increasingly authoritarian. And so, you know,
[00:12:54] it caused me to kind of spend time reflecting and being introspective like, wait, hold on a second.
[00:13:00] And people saying like, how can you still be, how can you call yourself a Democrat? And I was
[00:13:04] obviously, like I said, I've always been an independent minded person. I've been critical
[00:13:09] of people in power, whether they're Republicans or Democrats, and also complimentary when I felt
[00:13:16] like they did things that were good for the country. But, you know, looking at the dangerous
[00:13:23] combination of what we've seen over the last few years, especially of people in power who don't
[00:13:30] believe in the Constitution, who openly question things like the First Amendment and right to
[00:13:34] free speech coupled with, oh, by the way, they control and are politicizing agencies like
[00:13:40] the Department of Justice and the FBI and Department of Homeland Security sickening the
[00:13:46] domestic newly formed domestic terror unit of the Department of Homeland Security on parents,
[00:13:51] like protesting at board of education meetings, because they're like, well, we don't agree with
[00:13:55] what you guys are trying to teach our young kids at school. And to see that playing out before our
[00:14:02] eyes and this culture of fear, where if you speak out against this stuff and call it for what it is,
[00:14:11] you are immediately labeled anti authority and also therefore coming from our government
[00:14:19] an extremist and a potential threat, a potential domestic threat. And so that's why you're talking
[00:14:25] about the the Overton window and you and you look at like, okay, well, you take people having open
[00:14:30] minds and like, okay, well, I can consider, you know, someone else's perspective, even if I don't
[00:14:33] agree with it, which is how things should be in general. And then you take it to that next level
[00:14:39] where you're saying, well, there are no guardrails anymore. And this is what's so dangerous is when
[00:14:43] you have, again, people are entitled to their own opinions. But when you have people in positions
[00:14:49] of power in this country, who deny the existence of objective truth as they are, then where is,
[00:14:58] like, where's the floor? Where's the guardrails? Where's the ceiling? How do you measure anything?
[00:15:02] Well, it's like, okay, well, whatever's true is whatever they say is true. But then what happens
[00:15:08] when when they're gone and the next person or group of people come in or the next party and then
[00:15:13] what if they don't agree with what that group says is true or false? And so and then you couple
[00:15:20] that with the fear factor and cancel culture and and people literally seeing what happens to people
[00:15:24] like me, where you you just say like, hey, well, this is what's happening. And it's crazy. It's
[00:15:30] insane. And then I get called all kinds of names and all kinds of stuff, all kinds of attacks.
[00:15:36] And so no wonder so many people are afraid to do the equivalent of like, yeah, obviously,
[00:15:42] the emperor has no clothes, like we can all see it. And there's a lot of concern about what's
[00:15:46] happening. But so few people feel like they have the ability to speak up without being worried
[00:15:51] about losing their job or being shunned by friends or family members or being like that crazy person.
[00:16:01] And so this is this is kind of one thing that's been that's been interesting and
[00:16:05] and hope inspiring is is, you know, I put out this this kind of long and in depth statement
[00:16:10] talking about some of these very specific examples of what's wrong with today's Democrat party.
[00:16:16] And I've been hearing from a lot of people, people I know, a lot of people I don't know,
[00:16:21] in person on social media, people just saying like, like in a really serious and heavy kind of way,
[00:16:28] thank you for bringing voice to the things that I've been feeling and frustrated with. And but,
[00:16:33] you know, haven't been able to give voice to. And so my hope is that, you know, the more we speak
[00:16:41] up, the more people feel as though they can speak up. And yeah, how do we protect people?
[00:16:48] How do we protect our freedoms that are under attack by exercising them?
[00:16:52] Yeah, I was, you know, I was like to like cover a book on this podcast. Yeah. What when you were
[00:16:58] coming on, I said, I was thinking about covering the book Rules for Radicals by Saul Linsky.
[00:17:05] This is a book, you know, this is a guy that this is a book that Hillary Clinton wrote her
[00:17:10] thesis on when she graduated from college. But there's some of those rules. One of the one of
[00:17:17] the rules is hold them to their own rules, right? And that's what you're talking about when you say,
[00:17:24] hey, this is America, we have an open mind. And so you go, okay, cool, then you have to accept
[00:17:28] everything. Right? That's like one of those things. You can't say anything negative about
[00:17:32] anybody anytime, or you're, you're not following your own rules. You're something phobic, right?
[00:17:39] Everything is something phobic. You just add whatever it is at the beginning of it. Yeah.
[00:17:43] And another one of the rules that he talks about is the power of ridicule. So when you just go on
[00:17:50] an obliterating attack on a person, it's overwhelming for them and it works and it's worked a lot
[00:17:57] to shut people down and shut them up. And that's, you can see some of these the way that these
[00:18:06] rules are implemented. And that's another thing. You know, as I talk about that,
[00:18:09] that belt buckle thing, and you don't know where it came from. And there's a bunch of things like
[00:18:14] that in the middle. There's a bunch of traditions. You go, why do we, this is stupid? Why are we
[00:18:16] doing this? And you, and people don't really know where it came from. And I think some of the things
[00:18:22] that are going on with society right now, if you start to pull the thread on where it actually
[00:18:28] initiated, a lot of it did initiate in like the radicals, the communists in the 60s that were
[00:18:35] trying to make their impact. And I honestly don't think a lot of people that are fully on that,
[00:18:43] on board with that program know where it came from today. They're just doing what they kind of
[00:18:47] learned. Because that was, you know, a big goal was to take over the universities, which obviously
[00:18:53] they did a pretty good job, pretty good job taking over the universities. What is it? The
[00:18:57] universities vote 99, something like 99% democratic in universities. That's obviously,
[00:19:03] you're not going to get a very balanced education if that's what you're going through.
[00:19:07] And then the scary thing is, and this is another thing we've talked about a bit on this podcast,
[00:19:12] and is the, just the complete plasticity of people's brains and how people, you get into
[00:19:25] an echo chamber or you get, you start following and listening to certain things.
[00:19:29] It's going to take over your mind. And that's really, really scary. And, you know, I've been
[00:19:36] saying lately, like, everyone's getting brainwashed. I'm getting brainwashed right now. Like, that's
[00:19:41] what's happening. If you're watching, if you're listening, if you're opening your mind and letting
[00:19:45] other things in there, you're gaining brainwashed. And that's what's happening to everybody all the
[00:19:49] time. That's what, I mean, it's sort of like, it's a combination of brainwashing and learning,
[00:19:53] right? If you're learning, you're kind of getting brainwashed. You're bringing in new ideas.
[00:19:57] But then you see people that are learning ideas that aren't, essentially, they're not good.
[00:20:06] They're not healthy. And it's very, very disturbing. And especially nowadays, where
[00:20:13] that brainwashing is in your pocket. And at any moment, you can pull it out and you can,
[00:20:18] you can get brainwashed at any moment. And it's really, really scary. And especially, you know,
[00:20:26] the, the moldability of children. Yeah. 14 year olds, 12 year olds, 19 years old.
[00:20:34] You know, it's like when I joined the military, you're going to get brainwashed to some level.
[00:20:39] I got in trouble when I went to boot camp. Well, actually, I actually, I didn't get in
[00:20:45] trouble because they didn't know who said it. They, we had to fill out a form like about how
[00:20:51] boot camp was going, but it was anonymous. And they wrote something like, you know, what do you
[00:20:55] think of the program so far? And I wrote, the brainwashing has been very effective. That's what
[00:21:00] I wrote. How old are you at the time? 19, 18 or 19. And, you know, it's because I had a very
[00:21:10] rebellious mind, you know, because I was like, what was I brainwashed by? I was brainwashed
[00:21:14] before I joined the military by hardcore music and punk rock and like anti authoritarianism.
[00:21:20] And so for me, they were trying to hit me with that stuff. And I kind of had some good resistance
[00:21:24] to it. So I kind of like, oh, they're trying to brainwash me. And then I kind of made a joke
[00:21:28] about it. The brainwashing has been, you know, effective thus far, which that's what they're
[00:21:32] trying to do. They're trying to get you to like change your brain a little bit and think in a
[00:21:36] different way. And, and, but at least I think, I think I always had that rebellious streak in me
[00:21:43] that always questions everything. And to this day, when I see something online, I'm like, oh,
[00:21:48] what's their angle? Yeah, what's the angle over there? Because there's, everyone's got an angle.
[00:21:52] Everyone does. Which is, which is disturbing. And so this is what's happening now with kids.
[00:22:00] And you can see it. And it's sad. Yeah, it's so sad to see. I listened to a podcast that you did
[00:22:07] on your podcast, which is called the Tulsi Cabaret show with, was it called D transitioning?
[00:22:13] Yeah, with Chloe Cole. That was horrifying. Exactly. It was absolutely horrifying. Give us
[00:22:20] a quick brief on her. So Chloe Cole, and I'm glad you mentioned that because it's a perfect example
[00:22:26] of what you're talking about here. She grew up in here in California. She was a tomboy as a kid
[00:22:33] growing up. Love playing video games, love hanging out with her brothers. And at 11 years old, she
[00:22:40] got a smartphone. Started an Instagram account. She was a tomboy, didn't have many female friends,
[00:22:48] didn't really fit in much at school. So was looking for some kind of companionship friendship,
[00:22:55] sense of belonging online. And the algorithms on Instagram specifically, she talks about
[00:23:03] immediately started feeding her posts and accounts of young girls and women who had,
[00:23:14] who are identifying as boys or men who were trans or talking about how much happier they were by
[00:23:21] doing so and all of this. And then she had people around her who were telling her, well, like,
[00:23:26] if you're not happy as you are, then you're obviously a boy stuck in a girl's body.
[00:23:32] I'm going to just be, she's 11, she's 11, 11 years old. Her name is Chloe. At 12 years old,
[00:23:41] she told her parents, she wrote them a long letter. And the gist of it was, I am a boy,
[00:23:48] and I want you to call me Leo. I encourage you to listen to the story in her voice as she tells it
[00:23:56] because it is heartbreaking and so powerful. You watch it on YouTube, you just look into her eyes.
[00:24:04] She's 18 now. And so, but the summary is she starts taking puberty blockers
[00:24:14] when she's like 12, 13 years old. And she was very certain about what she wanted to do.
[00:24:22] Her parents were naturally pretty confused and not knowing what to do to best care for and love
[00:24:28] their daughter. And so they went out and started looking for health professionals to like, hey,
[00:24:34] just like educate us, talk us through this. What are the, you know, potential medical and health
[00:24:40] ramifications of our daughter taking these puberty blockers? And with the exception of one
[00:24:46] endocrinologist who told them like, hey, this, we don't know what the negative consequences might be,
[00:24:53] both in the short term and the long term to this, because there's just, you know, it's not been
[00:24:56] studied very well. There's no long history of cases that we can point you to say, well, here's
[00:25:02] what you can expect based on fact and science. And so this endocrinologist was saying like,
[00:25:09] I would encourage you to think very seriously before doing this because it could end up badly,
[00:25:13] essentially. I forget what the name, I think it was a gender specialist was what they were called,
[00:25:20] who were helping guide her through this. Every other medical professional that she went to see
[00:25:26] basically urged her and encouraged her to move forward with this. And ultimately told
[00:25:32] her parents who were expressing some concern and reservations, you have a choice between
[00:25:41] having a live son or a dead daughter. And Chloe says that up until that, like at that point,
[00:25:50] she had never once had a suicidal thought enter her mind. So this, this warning and essentially
[00:25:57] this threat that these medical professionals are giving to this young girl's parents, a live son
[00:26:05] or a dead daughter, you decide was based on nothing according to Chloe's medical history.
[00:26:13] Fast forward, she ends up getting a double mastectomy when she's 15 years old to continue
[00:26:22] this transition. She talks about how they call it top surgery to try to, you know, soften what
[00:26:31] it really is. And was after she got that surgery that she had a realization, I think she was 16
[00:26:37] at the time that she would know she would never be able to breastfeed her child ever. She, that
[00:26:44] had been taken away from her because of this, this decision. And you know, she talks about how she
[00:26:50] was asked at different points along this path from when she was 12 through 15, like, okay, well,
[00:26:57] here's all these medical disclosures. And, you know, you might not be able to have kids, this could
[00:27:02] affect your fertility. And at 12 years old, she's like, man, I don't want kids. Like, how does a
[00:27:07] 12 year old girl make that decision? And then again, at 15 before the surgery, like, okay, well,
[00:27:12] you might not be able to do this or have kids or breastfeed. And, you know, again, children not
[00:27:18] being equipped to make these decisions at 16, she experienced incredible regret and realized she'd
[00:27:25] make the biggest mistake of her life. And then began to walk down that path of quote unquote,
[00:27:31] detransitioning. And she talks about what that meant and practical terms in her conversations
[00:27:38] with her parents and friends and family being completely shunned by this group of, you know,
[00:27:42] people who are pushing this, this trans and gender ideology. Now, now people who celebrated her one
[00:27:50] day, and the very next day, once she was like, no, I've made the biggest mistake of my life,
[00:27:54] completely shunning her calling her names, giving her death threats online, doctors who had cared
[00:28:00] for her one day the next day, once she had made this decision, not returning phone calls or telling
[00:28:05] her like, you know, she's still having serious medical issues based on the the mastectomy she had,
[00:28:12] that she can't figure out what to do with the doctors like, oh, just put some Vaseline on there.
[00:28:18] And, and ultimately, these doctors are not providing her with the kind of care that she needs or
[00:28:23] being responsive at all. So she she's actually filed a lawsuit against these doctors and Kaiser that
[00:28:32] she dealt with along the way, which is so brave of her to do. She's so incredibly courageous to be
[00:28:38] doing what she's doing and speaking out and actively encouraging others to do the same so that people
[00:28:42] are able to be better informed. But that that social contagion that she talks really clearly about
[00:28:50] of the algorithms having such a heavy influence on her as a young girl, to ultimately bring her to
[00:28:57] make this decision, along with other other things as well. But the lack of, I guess, I guess this
[00:29:08] phenomenon in our society right now, where there's no open conversation about this that she could
[00:29:14] turn to that her family could turn to to say to get a differing perspective or differing view
[00:29:20] to where doctors feel afraid to say anything about it. I talked to a friend of mine who's an ER
[00:29:24] doc actually in California. And he said, Tulsi, I would say this off the record, but there are a
[00:29:31] lot of kids who are coming into the ER who are experiencing suicidal thoughts or deep depression
[00:29:39] or other medical issues because of this transition of people who are similarly like Chloe Cole
[00:29:46] regretting these decisions that they've made as kids. And but nobody's talking about it.
[00:29:52] You know, even from from the very top of of, you know, where he works, it was just like all of a
[00:29:56] sudden, okay, hey, guys, we're doing this now. And by the way, it's a very profitable venture
[00:30:05] knowing that not only the initial treatments, but you're basically once once somebody comes and
[00:30:09] tells you they want to do this, you're talking about years of follow on care and drugs and all
[00:30:14] and so on and so forth. But there was no conversation about this at all, because it's not allowed.
[00:30:21] If you even raise a question and say, Hey, is this really the best thing? Like, are kids really
[00:30:25] equipped to make this decision when they're 11 or 12 years old? You're immediately labeled a
[00:30:30] transphobe. And how dare you not care for your kids. In that podcast episode that I put out,
[00:30:36] there are actual videos from Boston Children's Hospital as one example of unfortunately, many
[00:30:41] where they're literally saying as soon as your child is capable of expressing themselves,
[00:30:46] you'll see signs of them, you know, deciding what their gender identity is, like before they can
[00:30:53] even use words and speak any kind of language that you look at like gestures and you look at all
[00:30:59] these different things. And you just you see how dangerous this is when critical thinking is like,
[00:31:05] it's discouraged. Asking questions is discouraged having differing points of view
[00:31:11] is discouraged. And I think even using the word discouraged is putting it lightly. People get
[00:31:16] banned on social media, get their accounts, you know, suspended indefinitely for
[00:31:23] asking questions or saying, Hey, this is not appropriate for kids. Again, then you add on the
[00:31:29] layer of government. And this is where things get so dangerous is that, you know, Chloe mentions
[00:31:36] that she knows people personally who parents who've had their kids taken away from them,
[00:31:43] simply because they refuse to call them by a name or pronoun different than the one they were given
[00:31:51] at birth by child protective services by the government. And this is this is the very real
[00:32:00] consequence of people just being willing to go along. And maybe it's like, I don't know,
[00:32:11] this doesn't seem right, but at least it's not happening to me or my kids or my family. So I'm
[00:32:14] just going to put my head in the, you know, in the sand and not pay attention. But there's,
[00:32:21] there's so many different factors you start looking at. I mentioned parents going and,
[00:32:25] you know, protesting like, no, you know what, I don't want my seven year old kid being given books
[00:32:31] to read at school about like, well, tell me what your sexuality is or tell me what your gender
[00:32:36] identity is. I didn't, you know, I heard parents talk about this stuff and I thought, gosh, you
[00:32:41] know, this is really concerning. And then I met with with a bunch of parents in Virginia who've
[00:32:46] been on the group called parents defending education have been kind of on the front lines of this
[00:32:51] fight nationally. And they brought a stack of books and showed me and there was one in particular
[00:32:57] that it, it was a graphic novel for middle schoolers. And I had never seen such sexually
[00:33:07] graphic images ever in my life. And this is something that's being given to kids to help them,
[00:33:14] you know, figure out, you know, what their sexuality is. And it's, it's really disturbing
[00:33:22] that we live in a society today where this open marketplace of ideas is not allowed to occur.
[00:33:31] And it's not allowed to occur because we have people in power who are using the lovers of
[00:33:36] government, working with people in the media and in big tech to control speech and to influence
[00:33:49] our society. So when I was a kid, let's say you are going to get crazy and really rebel,
[00:34:00] you'd grow your hair out, right? And wear a jean jacket or whatever, you know what I mean? Like,
[00:34:05] you're listening to Metallica and you're going to go through your Metallica phase and back then
[00:34:09] Metallica was not the same Metallica that it is now. I mean, back then Metallica was kind of
[00:34:14] fringe radical, right? And so you were going to grow your hair out and you were making all
[00:34:18] kinds of dumb decisions. I mean, let's face it, when you're that young, you're making just bad
[00:34:25] decisions left and right. And so thankfully, your decisions aren't permanent. When, when,
[00:34:30] when I was a kid, our decisions weren't permanent. Maybe, maybe you get some tattoos that you're
[00:34:36] going to want to wear, you know, a shirt or something when you get older, you're hopefully
[00:34:39] didn't jump straight into the neck tattoos or again, Overton window on face tattoos and neck
[00:34:44] tattoos. I mean, they're, they're becoming more and more mainstream right now. But back in the day,
[00:34:49] you weren't going to be doing that kind of thing when you were certainly not 11, 12, 13.
[00:34:55] And then you think about the Norwood, your parents let you. Yeah, well, there's another piece of
[00:35:00] this. Like at some point saying shut up to people became bad, right? When I was a kid, you tell
[00:35:10] people that your parents would tell you to shut up, your teacher would tell you to shut up,
[00:35:13] you would tell your friends to shut up when you were doing something, if you were saying
[00:35:16] something stupid, somebody like, Hey, shut up. And at some point that became like a bad word.
[00:35:22] Do your kids say shut up, Echo Charles? Not to me specifically, but yeah, they say that.
[00:35:26] Okay. But if they said it to you, be offensive. There'd be consequences. Which I agree with.
[00:35:31] I agree with, you know, you don't want to expect a kid, but would you tell your kids to shut up?
[00:35:36] I can't remember, but I'm not against the word shut up at all. Okay. I probably don't say shut
[00:35:43] up enough. And I don't think America does right now. Because sometimes, you know, when I was a
[00:35:49] kid, it's like, I'd have some stupid idea. I might have shut up. Like, okay, you got to stop sometimes.
[00:35:55] When we realize how multiple these kids are, and gullible they are, I mean, this is when, when you
[00:36:00] see like the interviews or read interviews, I got a book I haven't done on the podcast yet, but
[00:36:05] it's Nazis. Yeah. The young Nazi kids, they were 100%. They didn't know anything else. They didn't
[00:36:11] know anything else, at least a lot of them. And same thing with the Kamikaze pilots that are
[00:36:16] 19 years old. They didn't know anything else. And sure there's, I shouldn't, I want to group
[00:36:22] them all together because some of them definitely were like, Hey, wait a second, I'm not so sure
[00:36:26] about this. But then they got in those planes and drove them into our, our vessels, our ships,
[00:36:33] because they were just totally brainwashed, totally brainwashed. And we, that's how moldable
[00:36:40] kids are. And so when you take a freaking 11 year old girl, and you start down this path,
[00:36:47] and that's all she's hearing. And that's all the support you're getting. Because look, being a
[00:36:50] kid, you know, when I wrote my, when I wrote my first kids book, one of the things I had to put
[00:36:57] in perspective was that, you know, I was still in, when I was in the military, my kids were growing
[00:37:02] up. Part of my mind would be like, what are these kids talking about? Like nothing matters. This is
[00:37:07] Oh, you know, you know, Billy called me, whatever called me a jerk. And I'm like, so what? Right?
[00:37:15] I'm like, Hey, I'm going to Iraq. What are you kidding me? I got buddies at five face down in
[00:37:21] the mud so you could be called a jerk by your friend is freedom of speech. You know what I mean?
[00:37:24] Like that's how detached you get. You forget that when you're a kid, that's your whole world.
[00:37:29] Yeah. School is your whole world. The bully is your whole world. And, and so what happens
[00:37:37] when these kids get a world put around them, that only has one point of view and it's pushing in
[00:37:43] one direction, it's no surprise at all that they end up believing what they're hearing from everybody
[00:37:51] and everyone's so supportive. And that affirmation and the, I mean, it has, and there's no mistake
[00:38:00] for the radical increase in numbers of, of young kids who are now saying, well, you know, I'm trans
[00:38:07] or I'm, you know, anywhere on the spectrum of the LGBTQ stuff. It's not like been inching, like
[00:38:15] that it's like by hundreds of percent increasing to the point where, and I've talked with teachers
[00:38:20] who say like, yeah, of all the kids in my class, there's maybe two who don't consider themselves
[00:38:25] LGBTQ something. And so it's kind of become like an Abigail Shrier writes about this and her books
[00:38:33] about how kids are being influenced by this. You know, it's peer pressure. It's what's like,
[00:38:39] are you cool? Are you boring or all this other stuff? And I'm over here like, bring back Metallico.
[00:38:46] Let's bang heads and grow on there. That seems like a lot safer of a thing. You know, the other
[00:38:50] piece that you mentioned that is really disturbing. So you can't ask questions about this. So I, you
[00:38:58] know, I obviously work with a lot of companies talk about leadership. And one of the things I
[00:39:01] talk about when it comes to leadership is I should, if you've got, if you're working, if Tulsi, if
[00:39:06] you're working for me and I present a plan and you ask questions, I should be totally open to
[00:39:12] answering your questions. Your questions, hopefully are challenging to me and they make me really
[00:39:18] think through my idea and they pressure test my idea and I'm happy to answer them. And the minute I
[00:39:23] say, shut up Tulsi, I don't hear more questions, just do what I say. I just lost the argument. I
[00:39:29] just lost leadership capital because it means I couldn't actually articulate why we're going to do
[00:39:35] something a certain way. And it also means that I couldn't open my mind enough to say, Tulsi's got
[00:39:40] a good point. I should incorporate that into the plan or maybe adjust my plan or maybe abandon my
[00:39:44] plan because Tulsi has a really good thought process about this that I didn't think of. But
[00:39:49] the minute I say, you know what, just be quiet, no more questions, you do what I say. Exactly.
[00:39:55] That means there's something wrong. It exposes your weakness. Right. So if you have a question
[00:40:01] for me and my answer is you're transphobic, that's not a great answer. No. That's not a great answer.
[00:40:09] And look, could it be true? Could I be a person that I'm scared of transphobic people? Sure. Well,
[00:40:14] let me think through it then. What am I scared of? Okay, let's have a conversation about that.
[00:40:18] So, but instead, just to be like, no, I don't want to hear any more of your questions.
[00:40:22] This is a problem and it doesn't lead to a situation where we make progress and where we
[00:40:30] can actually agree upon anything. That's right. So how's the leadership, the governmental leadership,
[00:40:37] when you talk about the governmental leadership, kind of helping push this type of agenda? What
[00:40:43] does that look like? Well, it's exactly what you're talking about. The choice to ridicule, discredit,
[00:40:51] smear, and censor through partners in Big Tech, Google, Facebook, all of that, rather than actually
[00:41:00] have a conversation based on substance that's having this fear, this self-censoring effect
[00:41:11] on people where they're too afraid to even ask questions. They're too afraid to state their
[00:41:15] own views or opinions or even their own experiences on this. Have you had Kristen Beck on your podcast?
[00:41:23] I have not. I think I heard her talking on Rogan, but Kristen Beck has had similar experiences,
[00:41:31] even as a trans adult person saying, well, I don't know, like, this is really dangerous for kids.
[00:41:37] Like, this is a decision. If people want to make this decision as adults, this is a free country
[00:41:42] and you have the freedom to do that and live with whatever the outcomes of that decision may be.
[00:41:48] But for this to be happening to kids, and Beck has received extremely negative consequences,
[00:41:53] both on social media and in society, because of stating that fact,
[00:42:01] the government is pushing this under the guise of something they call gender affirming care,
[00:42:08] which sounds like something everyone should be for, right? We want to care for and respect each
[00:42:13] other just as people, but what they're doing is actually abuse of kids. Chloe Cole's story is not
[00:42:25] a rare case. There are many others, both documented, but also those that haven't been reported of kids
[00:42:34] who have gone through or going through exactly what she's been through. She started in Oregon,
[00:42:38] started an organization to be able to reach out to and help provide support to other kids who've
[00:42:42] gone through the path that she has walked down. The government factor is they're saying that if
[00:42:52] you as parents don't provide gender affirming care, then child protective services may come in and
[00:42:59] intervene in order to ensure that your child receives that care elsewhere. They are using this
[00:43:09] gender affirming care when it comes to federal funding. So for schools, for example, who the
[00:43:16] government says refuse to provide this quote unquote gender affirming care, which may come in the
[00:43:21] form of like, okay, not allowing boys to go into the girls locker room, boys who say, well, you
[00:43:32] know, I identify as a girl. If a publicly funded school does not allow that to happen, the federal
[00:43:40] government says, okay, we are not going to provide you with federal funding for what they call free
[00:43:47] and reduced lunch for kids who are at a certain low level in the poverty scale, get free and
[00:43:54] reduced lunch at schools. The government says if your school does not provide this gender affirming
[00:43:59] care by allowing boys to go into the girls locker room, boys who say they're a girl,
[00:44:04] then we're going to take that money away from you. Who hurts? Who's harmed in that scenario,
[00:44:10] which is actually happening. It's kids who are hungry who can't afford to buy their own lunch
[00:44:15] at school. And so, I mean, there's so many examples of this where their hypocrisy is just playing out
[00:44:21] literally in real time. Their hypocrisy of saying, well, hey, this year, 2022 is the 50th anniversary
[00:44:27] of the enactment of Title IX. The law that was put in place literally out of a recognition of the
[00:44:35] biological difference between the male and female sex and to make sure that there was a level playing
[00:44:41] field because kids like your daughter back in the day, they didn't have the opportunity to get on a
[00:44:48] girl's wrestling team because they didn't exist in schools and with most sports. It was like,
[00:44:53] okay, well, there's boy sports and there's girls cheerleading. That was kind of, you know, or like
[00:44:57] my mom, she had water ballet and my mom's pretty athletic, but her options were pretty limited
[00:45:02] as a kid growing up in East Grand Rapids in Michigan. So, Title IX 50 years later has created
[00:45:10] huge opportunities for girls and women in sports, which then leaves opportunities in different
[00:45:15] professions and so on in their life. On this anniversary, 50th anniversary of Title IX, now
[00:45:21] the government in this administration is trying to, or they are actually redefining Title IX in
[00:45:28] the law, not by passing an amendment through Congress, but instead back during it through a
[00:45:34] rule change to now include this gender identity, which basically says like anybody who says they
[00:45:40] are a woman can be a woman at any given point in time and therefore by doing so, erasing,
[00:45:50] doing two things, erasing women as a group in society because now you could, if you, if you
[00:45:58] wake up tomorrow, you're like, yeah, I'm a woman. All right. Well, the government says now you are,
[00:46:03] you are, you are the same protected class as a biological woman as, as me. Um, but, but the
[00:46:10] deeper kind of underlying danger goes back to where we started is this change is our government
[00:46:15] saying there is no such thing as objective truth. There is no such thing as biology. There is no
[00:46:21] such thing as this biological difference between a male and female. And if we, as a society, except
[00:46:27] this premise, then where are the boundaries? There, there literally are no boundaries. And
[00:46:34] where does this lead? I mean, I've talked about this before. You would think that kids are the
[00:46:40] one place where everyone in our society can agree. Like we have to, kids are the most vulnerable.
[00:46:46] We have to protect our kids. Well, now there, it has, it is starting to become acceptable
[00:46:51] to use this term minor attracted person, which is a pedophile. It's a pedophile. And yet you have
[00:46:59] teachers. That's the overton window expanding. Exactly. Exactly. That's what I'm talking about.
[00:47:04] And so people are like, Oh yeah, you know, we should just like let people be, they want to be in
[00:47:08] kids and this and that. Like, okay, so if you deny that shut up comes in, right? You should be like,
[00:47:14] Hey, no, shut up. You're not allowed to say that. Sure. We're there. Yeah, exactly. Seriously. And
[00:47:19] then you have people who are teachers in a position to care for our kids on social media. Like, yeah,
[00:47:26] I'm a minor attracted person. And this is how I feel when I'm standing in front of the classroom
[00:47:31] and using this very sexually explicit language. And parents are giving their children over to
[00:47:37] these people for, for more hours, waking hours of the day, probably then they spend time,
[00:47:43] they're able to spend time with their kids. And if you're, you become a bigot, if you're like,
[00:47:49] uh, yeah, no, this is not okay. This normalization of pedophilia is exactly what's happening right now.
[00:47:56] How does it happen? Where does it start going back to restart? Like, well, you look at each,
[00:48:02] you know, how this overton window is opening and pushing you not just to respect someone's
[00:48:07] different choices, but to openly accept and champion these things that are literally insane
[00:48:14] and are causing direct harm to our kids. And, and again, this is where the societal shift
[00:48:22] and change, this cancel culture, this, this fear mongering, pushing self-censorship coupled with
[00:48:28] the power of government, both directly and indirectly through big tech is, is, has put us in a very
[00:48:35] dangerous place in our society. How much did you see with big tech, uh, collusion with the government?
[00:48:44] When you were in the government? Um, quite a bit, especially when I ran for president.
[00:48:53] I, um, you know, I, I don't know, I could probably think of a number of reasons why it, uh,
[00:49:03] it escalated so quickly there where, you know, it got to a point where even as I was, you know,
[00:49:09] being very outspoken on different issues beforehand, I think certain powers that be maybe
[00:49:14] didn't think that, oh, well, you know, she's just saying her piece. She's over here on the sidelines,
[00:49:18] but, you know, running for president provides a certain platform. And, um, and it was, I mean,
[00:49:25] the, the first kind of eye-opening experience to me was when, uh, we had the very first presidential
[00:49:31] debate in the Democratic primaries. It was in 2019. Uh, you know, most people in the country
[00:49:37] didn't know who I was and never heard of me before. And my hope was, all right, cool. There'll be
[00:49:42] millions of people watching. And I think there were north of 20 million people who tuned into
[00:49:46] that first debate, maybe a little off, but ballpark. And, um, my hope is I'll be able to introduce
[00:49:53] myself, let people know why I'm offering to serve as president and commander in chief. And then,
[00:49:57] you know, they'll go online and say, okay, cool. I want to learn more. We set up all of our Google
[00:50:02] AdSense accounts in the hopes that they would do so and that I would be able to have my,
[00:50:06] my website there, uh, ahead of whatever stuff Google chose to push on people. I was the most
[00:50:15] searched candidate of the night after that debate, which we had hoped would be the case.
[00:50:20] And, uh, all of a sudden our, our Google ad account was suspended with no explanation,
[00:50:27] no notice, no message, like literally nothing, just crickets. And so our team immediately
[00:50:32] obviously started to reach out like, Hey, what's going on here? We set this up according to all
[00:50:36] the rules and da da da. We tested it beforehand. Everything was good. What happened? No response.
[00:50:42] And this went on for a period of time. And then all of a sudden we, we, we still never got a
[00:50:48] response. Then all of a sudden the account was, was, uh, the suspension was taken off the account.
[00:50:52] And that was the first like glaring example directly that I felt.
[00:50:58] What part of your mind was like, Oh dang, that, that's too bad. I can't believe this weird thing
[00:51:02] happened. And what part of your mind was like these bastards, these bastards, I went straight there,
[00:51:07] I went straight there because it was, it was, were you suspect already going into it? Did you,
[00:51:13] or is that just like a total eye opener? No, I mean, I had, you know, the, the, um, influence and
[00:51:20] impact of these big tech companies and social media was already pretty clear, you know, how
[00:51:25] their algorithms were trying to push certain kinds of information to invoke a certain response
[00:51:30] from their, from their users. I think things were becoming more and more clear just broadly at that
[00:51:34] point, uh, which is why when that happened, uh, it was way too much of a coincidence to just be a
[00:51:43] coincidence. Um, I, I ultimately filed a lawsuit against Google because of this to, to make the
[00:51:50] point and to make the statement that they shouldn't be allowed to get away with this. People need to
[00:51:55] know how much power a monopoly like Google has on directly influencing interfering in our
[00:52:03] elections. And that, that if they can do this to a sitting member of Congress running for the
[00:52:08] highest office in the land, making it so that they are manipulating and, and dictating what
[00:52:15] information people see when they type in, who is Tulsi Gabbard, they can do it to anyone for any reason.
[00:52:21] Uh, you know, whether you're running for mayor or dog catcher or whatever it might be,
[00:52:29] that this private corporation gets to determine what we as voters know and see and hear about a
[00:52:39] person. And that, that became increasingly clear throughout my entire campaign, how, um, you know,
[00:52:45] the, the power elite, as I call them, or the permanent Washington, that these are made up of
[00:52:51] some of the most powerful people in politics, the most powerful people in corporate media and the
[00:52:55] most powerful people in big tech are interfering in our elections by dictating who voters are
[00:53:02] exposed to and what they are exposed to about certain people who are, are running for office.
[00:53:06] They decide what, what the narrative, what the narrative is. And so to say, and this is, this
[00:53:14] is the thing, of course, they don't talk about when they talk about, you know, influence and
[00:53:18] interference in our democracy and our elections, but it is the biggest and most impactful thing
[00:53:23] that is influencing voters. Um, and, and there've been recent cases that have come forward about
[00:53:30] Google, for example, like in just in this past election, there was a report that was done
[00:53:35] showing that, you know, political emails from candidates going into Gmail accounts, which
[00:53:41] most people have favored sending these, uh, favored, uh, progressive or Democrat candidates
[00:53:48] or Democrat messaging to, to funnel those emails into your inbox. Whereas, uh, conservative or
[00:53:56] Republican political emails were more than 50% of the time end up in your spam box. So, you know,
[00:54:06] there, there are a lot of different examples of this, but it's a dangerous, dangerous thing.
[00:54:13] That is now going unchecked. There's no check and balance on that. And then you look at, well,
[00:54:19] okay, well, so what are the political leanings of these big tech companies and Facebook has,
[00:54:24] has obviously they've been in the news a lot about this as well. You know, they, they, they
[00:54:29] have a specific political slant, but to me, whether the political slant is to the left or to the right,
[00:54:37] or if it's Democrat versus Republican, if, if we don't number one, if we're not informed about it,
[00:54:43] not calling it out and not pushing our lawmakers to say, Hey, you know, this is this, we have to
[00:54:49] call it for what it is. They're directly trying to influence, um, influence our elections. We have
[00:54:55] to be willing to do it whoever is, you know, whatever their political slant is. The point is
[00:55:00] like freedom of speech is freedom of speech. We have to be willing to protect that freedom of
[00:55:04] speech, no matter, um, whether we like it or not, or whether we agree with that, that speech or not.
[00:55:11] I guess the live experiments going on right now with, with Twitter, right? With Elon. Yes.
[00:55:16] And what he's doing and he's bringing back all these people that were banned, including Donald
[00:55:23] Trump, he just brought back Donald Trump. I don't think Donald Trump has gone on and gone back to
[00:55:27] Twitter yet. And apparently he has some kind of commitment to the other, to the truth, which is
[00:55:35] another social media platform, truth, media, truth, truth, truth, social. Yeah. So, but Elon's
[00:55:43] let everybody on, except for Alex Jones, Alex Jones, he did not let our echo, you're laughing at
[00:55:49] that. Finally got to react that echo. Yeah. Nay, Alex Jones. Yes, that's funny to me, but I don't
[00:55:58] know. Okay. He's going through a lot of legal, legal situations right now. Yeah. What is he,
[00:56:04] he's owes billions of dollars currently, right? Billions of dollars to the parents of the Sandy
[00:56:10] Hook massacre. Uh, but so other than Alex Jones, it looks like, it looks like Elon and Twitter is
[00:56:17] just going wide open. Yeah. I think it's literally other than Alex Jones. What's interesting to me
[00:56:22] about that is the people who are publicizing that they're leaving because now, you know, as Elon
[00:56:29] said, he's a free speech absolutist. Which can you say that if you don't bring Alex Jones back on?
[00:56:34] I don't know. Can you? Is that, is that an absolutist? Technically, that's not absolute.
[00:56:38] Okay. So he's almost an absolute. I saw the other day that CBS news,
[00:56:46] what is it? They, they like, oh, we're leaving Twitter. And then I, was it like a day or two?
[00:56:51] And then they came back. They came back. You know, Fox news left Twitter for a long time.
[00:56:56] Is that right? They left, they left Twitter for, for months and months and months,
[00:57:00] they left Twitter and they stayed off. And I forget what brought them back on, but,
[00:57:05] but you, so you have this experiment kind of with Elon Musk right now, opening up Twitter.
[00:57:10] And I guess we'll see what happens. And I mean, the whole thing, it's just such drama. And that's
[00:57:16] one thing that's interesting. You know, I always feel like all this stuff that we're talking about
[00:57:21] is like a separate world that I'm actually not that, I don't get fully engaged in that world
[00:57:28] because I actually have a bunch of businesses and like things going on. And I feel like that's
[00:57:34] more normal. And if you're not careful, you think that this world that we're talking about,
[00:57:39] the world of social media, the world of Twitter, the world of Facebook, the world of Instagram,
[00:57:44] if you're not careful, you think that's real. And you have to remember that it's not real.
[00:57:48] And that it's just a, it's just a virtual world that's not real, but there's people that live
[00:57:54] and die in that world. And they, and that world drives them crazy. By the way, I got asked that,
[00:57:59] I got asked that on a podcast interview a little while ago, you know, well, how do you feel when
[00:58:05] people make bad comments about you on Twitter or on, and I said, Hey, I recommend you don't really
[00:58:11] get concerned about those things because it's a bot. It's a bot or it's a person that's just
[00:58:16] looking, it's a troll or a bot. That's pretty much what you're, how many, what percentage of
[00:58:20] negative comments are coming from a person that is making a negative comment because their goal
[00:58:25] is to help influence you and move you in a better direction and see their perspective. The chances
[00:58:29] is very few. It's a bot or it's a troll. So how are you getting spun up about this stuff? I was in
[00:58:35] Greensboro, North Carolina a few days ago, stopped in a little shop on the side of the road. And
[00:58:41] this guy comes up to me and he's like, Oh my God, are you Tulsi freaking Gabbard? It's like, Yeah.
[00:58:50] It's like, what are you doing here? There's nothing in Greensboro. It's like, Oh, you know,
[00:58:54] I'm here for this event. I'll be speaking at later on. And he's like, you know what,
[00:58:58] if I was on Twitter right now, I would be putting out a tweet saying how much I don't like Tulsi
[00:59:04] Gabbard, but now you're standing right in front of him and I can't freaking say that. Like, you're
[00:59:09] a real person. And you know, I ended up talking to him for about five minutes or so. And he's like,
[00:59:14] I got to take a picture. I was like, all right, if you posted on Twitter, you better like be
[00:59:18] true to your word here, buddy, and not, not start talking shit about me. But it was just funny,
[00:59:22] the interaction, which is exactly that. Like in real life, very rarely, I've actually had it
[00:59:30] happen a couple of times where people will come up and say the kinds of harsh, you know,
[00:59:33] mean criticisms that they say on Twitter, maybe all the time. But by and large, most people,
[00:59:39] they wouldn't have that kind of interaction with someone in real life.
[00:59:43] What was the guy's beef with you? Or what do you suspect? I don't know, you know, it was interesting
[00:59:48] because he was, because after he said that, he's like, all right, can I just ask you one question?
[00:59:52] I was like, yeah, like my ride's waiting outside. I don't have a lot of time, but
[00:59:56] he's like, you know, you, you say a lot of things that are pretty critical to democratic party. And
[01:00:01] I agree with a lot of those things, but why are you still a Democrat? I'm like, Oh, I'm not.
[01:00:05] He's like, Oh, you're not. It's like, no, go listen to episode one of my podcast. And there's 29
[01:00:12] minutes of me telling you exactly why I left the Democrat party. But then that was it. And then he's
[01:00:18] like, Oh my gosh, like, okay, I'm going to go and listen to that. But, and then he asked if he
[01:00:22] could take a picture. And then as I was walking out, there were people sitting next to him,
[01:00:25] was like, is that, is that Tulsi guy? I was like, yeah, anyways, it was just funny.
[01:00:30] Because I don't know that he knew exactly what his beef was. But for whatever reason,
[01:00:38] he was not positively disposed towards me. But then after four minutes of a conversation,
[01:00:45] and just recognizing like, Hey, yeah, I'm a real person. You're a real person. And maybe we don't
[01:00:52] agree on everything. Probably don't disagree on some things. Cool. That's fine. But, you know,
[01:00:58] street each other with respect. Yeah. And what's scary about that is someone that's just like,
[01:01:03] I don't, I don't like you. And I have beef with you and files on Twitter. I'd be talking smack.
[01:01:07] Yeah. And the main reason is because that you've been labeled as a Democrat. And so they're not
[01:01:12] a Democrat. So therefore they must hate you. Right. And that's the horrible thing, right?
[01:01:16] Because, you know, someone can be anything. And if you have an open mind and listen to what they
[01:01:22] have to say, you know, well, they got some good points there. And that really doesn't make any
[01:01:24] sense to me right now. But let's hear what their perspective is. And that's a good way to,
[01:01:30] a good way to like, survive and live with other human beings in the world. Yeah. Listen to what
[01:01:37] they have to say, maybe try and see their perspective a little bit, which it just seems like is very
[01:01:42] limited, especially in the, in the world of social media. Yeah. And this, this goes to, you know,
[01:01:49] one of the, this is something that I talked about in my statement about why I left the Democrat
[01:01:55] party is how divided our country has become largely because of those, those, you know, well,
[01:02:03] if you are white, therefore you are this. If you are black, therefore you are that.
[01:02:09] And, and how the Democratic party has completely gone against Dr. King's dream of this, you know,
[01:02:18] that his kids would one day grow up in a society where we're judged based on our character,
[01:02:21] not the color of our skin. Well, now even in our, our schools, elementary schools, they want our
[01:02:27] kids to be taught that if you're white, you're privileged. If you are a person of color, then
[01:02:33] you are the oppressed or you are the victim and dividing us based on the color of our skin and
[01:02:40] racializing everything in our society. If something happens, well, obviously it's because of race,
[01:02:46] obviously it's because of the color of your skin. And you, you can go down that path of these broad
[01:02:52] categorizations, whether it's based on party politics or race, ethnicity, religion,
[01:03:00] any of these boxes that, that they like to put us in and use as wedges to drive us apart,
[01:03:08] rather than again, focus like, all right, let's just go below the surface and recognize that,
[01:03:12] you know, all people from Hawaii are not the same or, you know, whatever the fill in the blank is,
[01:03:23] we get into dangerous territory when we judge each other just based on, you know, the superficial
[01:03:29] or the label that is attached to us. And I've been on the receiving end of this constantly,
[01:03:35] because I've never fit into any one of those specific boxes. And, you know, friends of mine
[01:03:41] say, well, that, that hurts you politically because then you don't have like that natural support base.
[01:03:47] But, you know, none of us as people are, are monoliths, none of us are just walking around as
[01:03:52] like, oh, you know, this, these labels are attached to me, therefore I am that and it assuming that
[01:03:59] in our society has the negative effect of, of not encouraging that critical thinking, that independent
[01:04:06] thought, that healthy skepticism of like, all right, when I read this story or I hear this view,
[01:04:13] where are they coming from? What's the angle on it? What's, what's, what's their experience?
[01:04:17] Maybe that's informed that that may be different from my own. And what can I learn from it?
[01:04:21] You know, or what, maybe I end up disagreeing with it. And, but I've thought through here are the
[01:04:26] reasons why not just because like, oh, that person is in this category or this group, therefore
[01:04:32] I must disagree, I must be opposed. And, and that's a, it has the opposite effect of
[01:04:41] I think the foundation of this country, which is we are all Americans out of many, there are one.
[01:04:47] And this kind of individual thought and freedom of expression was celebrated at one time in this
[01:04:53] country. And now worse than not being celebrated, there are punitive effects and consequences
[01:05:00] to that freedom of expression, to where it becomes freedom of expression, you know, for those in power,
[01:05:06] freedom of expression is only celebrated if they agree with it.
[01:05:08] Imagine the being the adversary of America, like you're China right now, and you're just sitting
[01:05:15] there watching this unfold. And there's no better way to destroy your adversary than to have them
[01:05:21] destroy themselves. And so it's no, it's no surprise when, you know, the, the, the Russian
[01:05:28] bought farms were setting up these, these pro, these counter protests and protests in the same
[01:05:34] neighborhoods and, and, and really just doing all they could to divide America. And that's why
[01:05:42] where I always try and keep that top of mind for myself when, when I get put into a scenario
[01:05:50] where someone's trying to, you know, frame me up mentally, frame me up mentally. I'm always thinking
[01:05:58] to myself, okay, well, hold on a second. Don't get me wrong. I'm always thinking to myself,
[01:06:02] okay, well, hold on a second. Don't get framed up mentally. Listen to what someone else has to
[01:06:07] say. See what their perspective is. And remember that they're American and I'm an American.
[01:06:10] Because if I'm an American and you're American, cool, we got all kinds of things in common,
[01:06:15] all kinds of things in common. I think I said this on this podcast before, unless you're an actual
[01:06:21] ISIS member, I, I, I, we're going to find some common ground. Like we're going to both like
[01:06:28] UFC or we're going to both like guitar, like there's going to be something there. Yeah. We're
[01:06:33] going to both like Led Zeppelin or whatever. There's going to be something there where we go,
[01:06:38] okay, cool. I'm, I'm down. You know, only listen to Led Zeppelin. Cool. What's your favorite album?
[01:06:42] Like, let's go. But it's really easy to just focus on, oh, you like this and I don't like that.
[01:06:50] Therefore, you're my enemy and we should fight, which is really, really freaking lame. Yeah.
[01:06:56] It's really lame. And that's where we get framed up all day. Day long and social media is the
[01:07:01] amplifier of that, that we've never seen before. Truly. Never seen before. I think it would clean
[01:07:06] up a lot on Twitter if you were only allowed to be you. You're only allowed to have your name.
[01:07:10] Yeah. I agree with that. You can hide behind. Isn't that kind of what Facebook does? Facebook
[01:07:15] does that, right? Can you be on Facebook and be like, you know, alpha 29474 and make a bunch of
[01:07:22] comments? Echo Charles expert. That's not a yes or no question. You kind of can't, you could probably
[01:07:28] get away with it to a degree. Yeah. Yeah. False name or yeah. Yeah. Cause I see people with that
[01:07:34] on Facebook. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. With the something other than their real name. Yes.
[01:07:39] So maybe if you're going to make, which is like the catfishing, right? Like they put up,
[01:07:43] they find like pictures of, well, that depends if they're trying to misrepresent their identity.
[01:07:48] That's true. But to take advantage of someone else. Yeah. You know, that's like an alias,
[01:07:53] nickname, you know, that kind of, I see that for sure. But I, I don't think Facebook is like
[01:07:59] openly permissive about it. I think it's like they try to make you have your real name. It seems
[01:08:04] like it seems to me when I look at Facebook comments, they're people. Yes. Twitter comments.
[01:08:10] Maybe not so much. No, no, no, no, no, no. YouTube fully not. And the divisiveness people.
[01:08:18] This is another thing that I find interesting is people talk about it's never been more divisive
[01:08:23] than it is now. And I get it. We want to make headlines, but man, we had a literal civil war
[01:08:29] where 650,000 people died, 650,000 people died. Right. And even in the late 60s, early 70s,
[01:08:37] there was crazy, crazy civil unrest. And there was, you know, the Sibonese liberation army and the
[01:08:45] black liberation army and the black Panthers and the weather underground. And these were groups
[01:08:51] that were killing. Like there was like something like 35 police officers that were assassinated.
[01:08:57] There was bombings. Bombings happened so much in those days that it was, it almost didn't even
[01:09:03] make the headline of the news. I mean, if there's a, if someone puts a bomb off today in America,
[01:09:08] that's going to be in the front of every news story, every news corporation there is.
[01:09:13] Back in the late 60s, early 70s, that stuff was just happening. They were just blowing stuff up.
[01:09:17] So it's not as bad. It's not the worst it's ever been. But it certainly seems that way when you
[01:09:23] go on social media and you start paying attention to that mayhem. Yeah, it's true. And, you know,
[01:09:30] I don't know what the recent numbers, but I feel like Twitter, you might know this echo,
[01:09:36] but Twitter, I think is like, compared to the old, you're the tech guy, but it's something like,
[01:09:45] like less than 5% of Americans are on Twitter. It's something, it's a really, I was just
[01:09:50] surprisingly low number. But you look at, it is known as the place for people in politics and the
[01:09:59] media. And so when you look at the outsized influence, you know, like a tweet can make a news story.
[01:10:07] It's not representative of, you know, the vast majority of Americans in this country.
[01:10:13] But it has an outsized effect. It does have an outsized effect. And I think that is safe to
[01:10:18] say it's not the, it's, most people aren't spending, I had this conversation with Ben Shapiro.
[01:10:23] You know, he was talking about all this stuff and I said, Hey, Ben, you're at ground zero
[01:10:27] for like political controversy in mayhem. And most people in America are just like
[01:10:32] working their job, going to their kids jiu-jitsu tournament, wrestling tournament,
[01:10:36] piano recital. That's what most people are doing. Now, if you want to open up that app and just get,
[01:10:42] let it creep into your brain, it's going to get in there for sure. Yeah.
[01:10:47] I had to take during, when I was running for president, my husband, like he doesn't like
[01:10:51] politics and he's not a guy, he's not a social media guy at all. But he was starting to look at
[01:10:59] Twitter a lot. And it got to the point where it was like actually caught like first of all, he's
[01:11:04] like, who is this person? Where are they? Where do they live? But, but I remember like we're sitting
[01:11:11] in like an Olive Garden for dinner, probably in New Hampshire somewhere. And he was, it was,
[01:11:15] he was glued to his phone and I could like almost palpably feel his blood pressure rising. And,
[01:11:22] you know, his, his like stress and anxiety and anger and just all of these emotions. And
[01:11:26] there was a few times I literally had to physically pull his phone from his hand. And then he
[01:11:31] ultimately just deleted the app because, you know, this is not a world that he lives in. I've been
[01:11:36] used to all kinds of attacks for a really long time. But it has, yeah, I mean, for, for, you can
[01:11:46] understand that for people who don't aren't accustomed to that sort of thing, it can have a
[01:11:51] really, really negative emotional impact. Oh yeah. We had one of my buddies, Micah Fink,
[01:11:58] who runs an awesome organization helping vets. But he said something when he was on the podcast
[01:12:04] about like, you are giving the energy to the thing that's eating you. So like your husband just
[01:12:10] going, Oh, you know what? I've had enough of this delete. Yeah. That and one of our friends, Jack
[01:12:15] Daniel, Jack Daniel Hill just went on like a retreat into the mountains. And I was like, Oh,
[01:12:22] how was it? You know, just talking to him. And the first thing he goes, it was four days, no phone,
[01:12:28] no watch, didn't even know what time it was. And he said, when he got back, he said, it was such a
[01:12:33] good like dopamine reset because you realize what that phone does to you, like how it makes you feel.
[01:12:41] And you know, it's like, I talk about fasting from food. And one of the best things you get
[01:12:44] from a food fast is it recalibrates your hunger, right? Like you think like it's been two hours,
[01:12:50] dude, I'm starving. You're an idiot, right? And then you get done with like a fast, a three day
[01:12:58] fast. And you're like, I'm not even close to hungry. I'm fine. And so the dopamine hit on the phone
[01:13:04] is the same thing. Like you take a break from that thing. And you go, Oh, this thing is running my
[01:13:10] brain. Yeah, it's got it's got ownership of my brain. You can't let that happen. Yeah. And you
[01:13:15] don't even realize it. Yeah, that documentary social dilemma was very eyeopening in how intentional,
[01:13:22] completely intentional. Like they're looking for that exact effect. Oh, completely like the smallest,
[01:13:29] littlest things like opportunity for exploitation, left, right and center and it's constant. And it's
[01:13:37] a yeah, I used to wear an Apple watch and I don't anymore specifically because like, I don't need
[01:13:43] that. Oh, constantly, constantly. You know, I tell the weird thing is like on Twitter,
[01:13:48] obviously, and look, I like Twitter. And what I like about Twitter is it's fun, because it's
[01:13:56] basically for my, for lack of a better word, personality, you get to sit there and make
[01:14:02] one liners. Yeah, it's basically just one liners and and it's easier than one liners if you and I
[01:14:07] are talking because if you and I are talking, I have to do a one liner on the spot. I have one
[01:14:11] second thing about it. I got to do it. Yeah, with Twitter, I can take seven minutes to think of a
[01:14:16] really good one line, right? So of course, you're going to win. Of course, you're going to sound
[01:14:19] you're going to sound funny or whatever. And it's a fun thing to do. But man, sometimes I'll like
[01:14:24] read someone that's putting something on Twitter. And you can see that they're putting some little
[01:14:31] fraction of their of their soul into it. Maybe that's a strong word, but they're putting at least
[01:14:35] some level of effort of like, Hey, I want to make this point, people have to hear this. What I'm
[01:14:40] about to say is going to have impact. And I'm thinking, I'm sorry, man, but like, if you're
[01:14:45] looking to change the world, you shouldn't be trying to change the world on Twitter. You should
[01:14:49] be trying to change the world through some other things, start a business, grow a company, go out
[01:14:52] and talk to people and communicate with them in a broad long term format. But but to sit there and
[01:14:58] be like, All right, this is the thread. This is the thread that's really going to change things
[01:15:03] up. This is the one. So I think that's a little bit sketchy. And you have to watch out for that.
[01:15:09] And and again, I also think that Twitter, originally as a method of communication, when I
[01:15:15] originally got on it, Tim Ferriss, he says to me, Oh, no, it's a really good way to like,
[01:15:19] talk to people and communicate with them. And you can get a bunch of information. I was like,
[01:15:22] Oh, I guess that sounds cool. And at some point, Twitter went from a way to communicate with a
[01:15:27] bunch of people and have them communicate back to you and people you don't know, and it's all good.
[01:15:29] And we can all it went from that sort of a positive communication. And I still think I feel I still
[01:15:35] feel that way about it. Like I'll go on have all kinds of positive, really good interactions
[01:15:39] with people. I'm probably the only person that's just on there trying to have a positive interaction.
[01:15:45] Even when people say negative stuff to me on Twitter, I always say, Oh, that's a cool perspective.
[01:15:49] Thank you. Like, well, that makes sense. I never thought of it that way. And let me keep an open
[01:15:54] mind here. Instead of just going on the attack. But yeah, people got to watch out for that one.
[01:15:59] Yeah. So my approach is a little different than yours. I am and you know, the, you know, social
[01:16:08] media strategists may have have some, some constructive feedback here, but I do try to be
[01:16:14] pretty intentional about things that I put out on social media at real large, but Twitter limitation
[01:16:20] of space, I put, I put some thought into the statements that I'm making in the hope that it
[01:16:25] will have an impact, at least causing people to ask a question or maybe stop and think about
[01:16:30] whatever the topic is that I'm commenting on and using it as a platform to help inform and engage
[01:16:37] on, on the issues, issues of the day. It's challenging because it's so short. But to me,
[01:16:44] all of these different platforms, yes, there's, there's positives and negatives to them. So I want
[01:16:48] to try to, I do, I want to be very intentional about what I am putting out responses, you know,
[01:16:56] cross, cross the spectrum. But to me, this is like really the thing is like people are like, oh,
[01:17:02] you know, I always laugh at the comments that are like, Oh, I hate what you say, or you're so ignorant,
[01:17:08] or you're terrible, all of these different things like dude, unfollow. It's as simple as that. Or
[01:17:14] you should not be allowed to speak and da da da da da da unfollow. And that's, that's where like,
[01:17:20] you see how again, people in government and people in positions of power, like, well, we need to ban
[01:17:26] hate speech, we need to ban misinformation and disinformation. Who gets to decide what that is?
[01:17:33] You know, your, you know, what echo might think is hate speech, maybe different from what you
[01:17:38] might consider hate speech, what's offensive to him might be different than what's offensive to you.
[01:17:42] You know, Missy, we saw this through the COVID pandemic, right? One day, Dr. Fauci says, oh,
[01:17:47] masks are useless, don't go buy them. Then the next day is like, well, actually, everybody really has
[01:17:52] to wear a mask. Like, okay, so who gets to say what is misinformation and disinformation and what
[01:17:57] should be banned versus not banned. The postmortem on the COVID is very crazy to look at. Yeah,
[01:18:06] it's a great case study for what we're talking about. The last time you were here, the last time
[01:18:09] you were here, you did do a podcast, but you were in town and Echo and I were here and you just
[01:18:14] were like, hey, I'm in town, swing by. And so you were here. Echo and I were like, way beyond COVID.
[01:18:22] I guess we were just like not wearing masks, not doing anything. You were here, you were still,
[01:18:28] you were still in Congress. You were here, you had two masks on. We ended up having,
[01:18:33] I had enough, having to send you the horrible text of like, hey, I'm really sorry, but both Echo
[01:18:39] and I have COVID after you left. But what you, when you look back, what do you think of that whole
[01:18:46] gig, that whole COVID thing? Like it was mayhem. It was, it was mayhem and a lot of it was caused by
[01:18:55] a lot of, I mean, look, I mean, Fauci was lying about masks because he didn't want people to go
[01:19:02] buy masks because he felt like there wasn't enough masks for healthcare professionals.
[01:19:08] And I think at different points, you know, you saw how you're not allowed to go to church,
[01:19:14] not allowed to go to a funeral, not allowed to have a wedding. You're not allowed to gather with
[01:19:19] friends in your house, not allowed to have birthday parties, but-
[01:19:22] You go to Home Depot, Walmart and McDonald's.
[01:19:25] Home Depot, Walmart, McDonald's, or 50,000 people in a Black Lives Matter, March, shoulder to shoulder.
[01:19:32] Social distancing, six feet apart, like, yeah, no. And just the direct statements that these so-called
[01:19:39] healthcare professionals made during that time was like, oh, well, you know, the cause is worthy.
[01:19:45] So therefore, it outweighs the risk of COVID. But your kids are not allowed to go to school.
[01:19:51] My whole perspective on this is individual choice. And so for me, like, I travel a lot,
[01:19:59] I do a lot. I don't want to get sick. I was wearing masks on planes before COVID happened
[01:20:03] because I can't afford to have days out where I can't do what I need to do, whether that was in
[01:20:09] Congress or now. You know, I have people in my family who have compromised immune systems.
[01:20:14] So generally, I am more careful than your average person because I can't afford to get sick.
[01:20:21] But it comes down to the idea of individual choice was thrown out the window. And we saw
[01:20:29] how people in power were claiming to act in the best interest of quote, unquote, public health.
[01:20:36] But it really got to a point where this was about compliance or face the consequences. It became
[01:20:43] about power. And that's the dangerous thing as we look back at what happened.
[01:20:48] How much did government trust decay because of COVID?
[01:20:53] How much did government trust what?
[01:20:54] Decay.
[01:20:55] What do you mean?
[01:20:56] I mean, people that maybe before COVID would be like, oh, you know, government's saying something.
[01:21:00] It's, you know, it's the government decaying trust in the government. Yeah, exactly.
[01:21:05] I think I think that that lack of trust went up dramatically. Because, you know, God, what was it?
[01:21:13] One of these mainstream media, I don't know if it's the New York Times, New York, or one of these
[01:21:18] had an op-ed recently published where they're just like, oh, people should just forgive
[01:21:22] people like Dr. Fauci for being wrong because, hey, nobody really knew what was going on.
[01:21:29] And a lot of parents being like, hold on a second, you know, my kid was out of school for two years
[01:21:34] and you want us to just forgive and forget as my kids trying to, you know, play catch up or,
[01:21:40] just whatever, you know, again, like I've, families who could not go and see a loved one
[01:21:47] in the hospital before they died. There's not a whole lot of forgive and forget, I think,
[01:21:53] going on by people who really, really were, you know, small business owners who were forced out
[01:21:57] of business. And there's just so many different examples. You know, from a leadership perspective,
[01:22:03] you have to be honest with people about what you know and what you don't know and what's like
[01:22:09] your best guess and what, and look, it never inspires confidence, right? If we're in combat
[01:22:14] and I say, hey, Tulsi, I guess you should move to that next building, right? Like,
[01:22:22] that doesn't inspire the kind of confidence that people want to hear. But if you and I are working
[01:22:25] together and you know that, listen, all leadership decisions are a guess, they really are. You're
[01:22:31] not making any leadership decisions that I know 100 or very few. Let me rephrase that. Very few
[01:22:37] leadership decisions that you make as a human being in a leadership position, you know 100%
[01:22:41] what's going to happen. And if you did, then who cares, right? If I know 100%, oh, I know 100%
[01:22:46] if we make this investment, we will 100%, that's not even a decision, right? That's just a smart
[01:22:50] move that you're going to make. If I knew on the battlefield 100%, if you take down this building,
[01:22:54] we're going to get the flank on the enemy and not lose anybody. Great. That's not a,
[01:22:59] that's just a move, right? But when it comes to making decisions, you got to recognize number one
[01:23:06] that, hey, this is a guess that I'm making right now based on the information that I have. And
[01:23:10] when more information comes out, I'm probably going to have to make adjustments to what I said
[01:23:14] 15 minutes ago, 15 days ago, 15 weeks ago or whatever. And yet it seemed like people's egos
[01:23:21] were so fragile that they just dug in and just, even when it made no sense anymore. Even when it
[01:23:27] made, after they had the freaking Super Bowl in Los Angeles with how many people were there at
[01:23:32] Coach Charles? I don't know. 80,000 or something like this. And they're all in there. And then
[01:23:38] in LA at that time, I had gone to LA for something. It was full on, I'm like, everyone's wearing a
[01:23:45] mask. And then they had the Super Bowl and no one's wearing a mask. And then they go back and
[01:23:51] it didn't make sense. And no one said, Hey, you know what? What we thought a month ago, two months
[01:23:55] ago, whatever, we've adjusted what we were thinking because we might have been wrong about that. And
[01:24:01] here's what we're thinking now. This is our best guess. This is how we're going to move forward.
[01:24:05] None of that happened. It was freaking ridiculous. And the crazy thing is, as someone who has,
[01:24:12] especially in the military, but in politics, been exposed to good leaders and bad leaders,
[01:24:18] what I would hope for from someone in a leadership position is just that honesty and transparency.
[01:24:25] Say, Hey, here's the decision that we made based on the information that we had.
[01:24:29] We have new information. And so here is the guidance or here's the direction
[01:24:33] that we're headed. Like that would engender more trust and more respect to those in positions of
[01:24:41] power and leadership rather than exactly what you're saying we saw where they were more concerned
[01:24:47] about not admitting like, Hey, we got that one a little wrong. We're going to adjust and kind of
[01:24:54] course correct. They're more concerned about that than they were about actually doing what was right
[01:24:59] and what was best and not concerned for the consequences, more concerned for themselves
[01:25:03] and how people might perceive them. Yeah. And that's what's weird. Everybody knows.
[01:25:10] Everybody knows. I asked hundreds of people this question when I talk about leadership,
[01:25:14] like if I go to you and I say, Hey, Tulsi, I'm not really sure how to conduct this mission.
[01:25:19] What do you think we should do? Yeah. Everybody knows that that's a better attitude
[01:25:24] and better leadership than if I'm not really sure how to conduct an operation. I say, All right,
[01:25:28] Tulsi, here's how we're doing it. And this is what we're going to do because I said so.
[01:25:33] Everybody knows that the first leader that asked for input and has an open mind,
[01:25:37] everybody knows that leader is more respected. Everybody knows that. And yet when we're in
[01:25:42] the leadership position, we decide to think, You know what? Everyone's going to think I'm,
[01:25:45] I don't know what I'm doing. If I ask Tulsi what her opinion is, it's freaking totally ridiculous.
[01:25:50] And it's totally wrong. And yet it's our ego, our ego so strong that it overpowers our
[01:25:57] actual knowledge of what good leadership is. We all know the better leader says, Hey,
[01:26:02] you know, I'm never conducting operation like this before Tulsi, I know you have,
[01:26:05] how do you think we should do it? Everybody knows that that's better leadership than
[01:26:09] Tulsi's got a bunch of experience in this type of operation. I've never done it before, but
[01:26:13] I don't want to look bad. So I'm going to dictate how we're doing it. Everybody knows that that's
[01:26:16] bad. Yeah. And yet our ego pushes us to do that. It's, it's ridiculous. That's how strong the ego
[01:26:20] is. One of my favorite series of all times is band of brothers. And it was something that
[01:26:28] I first learned about as an E. I'd just gotten into the army national guard. We did our annual
[01:26:33] training at Fort Indian town gap in Pennsylvania. And I had happened to pick up the book band of
[01:26:38] brothers by Dick Winters. As we were out there was reading it was on the plane going back to
[01:26:44] Hawaii when I finished it in the very back of the book, it says, you know, Dick Winters has
[01:26:49] now retired and is residing in Fort Indian town gap. Pennsylvania house like, Oh my God,
[01:26:53] I would have loved to go knock on that guy's door. That would have been incredible. But
[01:26:57] I've watched that series so many times in OCS. We actually had, we watched episode by episode,
[01:27:02] we had to write essays on each episode talking about leadership lessons. And for those who've
[01:27:08] seen it, the captain sobel character who was Ross from friends, he is that guy. He is that guy who
[01:27:15] was totally driven by ego did not care about what was right or drawing from experience or anything
[01:27:21] else. He was right to a fault and his soldiers suffered and they lacked any respect for him,
[01:27:28] like blatantly saluted the rank solely. But that was it, like following him into combat terrified
[01:27:35] them. And they talked about this and raised this through their chain of command versus Dick Winters,
[01:27:40] the guy who really represented and embodied those, those, the, the characteristics of servant
[01:27:47] leadership and humility and, you know, drawing on the strengths of his NCOs and his men to be
[01:27:53] able to make sure that they were taking care of each other and accomplishing the mission.
[01:27:57] Yeah. At Escalon front, we do that. We, we actually take chunks of band of brothers and talk about
[01:28:03] it. And again, everybody knows that captain sobel is hated. And everybody knows that when you
[01:28:10] come, when you try and demand respect from people, it doesn't work. Everybody knows that. And yet
[01:28:14] people freaking do it. Escalon front, my leadership company wouldn't exist if this stuff, if people
[01:28:19] could just, just kind of execute on what they know. Yeah. But that ego is so strong that it just
[01:28:26] overpowers the ability to listen to what other people have to say. It overpowers the people,
[01:28:32] the ability to allow themselves to be influenced by what other people are saying. They think of
[01:28:37] that as weakness. If you say, Hey, Nako, I think we should attack this target from the north instead
[01:28:41] of from the west. And in my mind, I think, wait a second, I'm going to look weak if I accept
[01:28:46] Tulsi's input right now. So no, right. Our ego just drives us. And this is again,
[01:28:53] I think this is one of the major issues that we see in America is that a lot of times people think,
[01:29:01] I'm going to look weak if I do this, I'm going to look bad, or I don't want to submit.
[01:29:06] I don't want to subordinate my ego. I don't want, I don't want Tulsi to be the one that had the good
[01:29:11] idea. So I'm not going to use her idea. I'd rather just fail. It's in a crazy, it happens in business
[01:29:17] a lot where I come up with the idea, my idea is not working, but it was my idea. So I'm just going
[01:29:21] to lose. I'm going to go bankrupt. And people think, no, no one would do that. Oh, yes, they will.
[01:29:28] And they do. And the extreme example is combat. There's plenty of historical examples where people
[01:29:35] where people have gotten their troops killed and in some cases gotten themselves killed
[01:29:42] because they just didn't want to, they didn't want to say, you know what, I was wrong about this word.
[01:29:45] We shouldn't attack. We shouldn't do a frontal assault right now. We should actually take a step
[01:29:50] back, maybe retreat a little bit and come and attack a different day. There's plenty of examples
[01:29:54] in history where people die because their ego gets in the way. So it happens in business. And if it
[01:29:59] can happen in, in business and people can bankrupt a company, it can happen in battle and people
[01:30:03] can get people killed. It will certainly happen all day on Twitter where people say, I would
[01:30:08] rather just perish than, than admit that, oh, that's a good point. I didn't think through that.
[01:30:13] And obviously it happens in politics every single day. And I think the interesting thing about that
[01:30:19] is these are decisions that are made out of fear. Their motivation is fear ultimately is
[01:30:25] themselves looking stupid or silly or not getting the credit or whatever it is. And I, I could
[01:30:30] the examples day and night, I could tell you in politics how people who are elected into these
[01:30:36] positions of leadership are really followers who are looking to react to certain situations,
[01:30:44] what will put me in the best light, you know, how can I take advantage of this to further myself
[01:30:49] or make those decisions based on fear, fear of like, Hey, I don't want to stand out from the
[01:30:55] crowd. I don't want to get this criticism. I don't want to be ostracized by this group or that group.
[01:31:00] Or what if these people don't like me or what if, you know, I don't get the credit for this. And,
[01:31:06] and that was, you know, one of the first days that I had as a new member of Congress in Washington,
[01:31:13] you know, the message from Democratic Party leadership was like, Hey, you, you need to make
[01:31:19] sure that, that we as a party get the credit for what you're doing. So if there's a bill with a
[01:31:24] good idea that one of your Republican colleagues puts forward and they want you to join them on it,
[01:31:29] don't do it because you'll make them look good. Just take their idea and you introduce the bill
[01:31:33] so that you and therefore the Democrats get credit for it. And then, and only then will we advance
[01:31:40] that idea because if it's the other guys and now, you know, we'll just let that bill die silently
[01:31:44] in the night. And, and, you know, if, if this were just, you know, I don't know, running for
[01:31:54] class president in high school, that'd be one thing. But then you take this example and you
[01:31:59] look at people who are making decisions based on our foreign policy and where and when our men
[01:32:04] and women are sent into combat and not being willing to say, Hey, we got that one wrong or,
[01:32:11] Hey, we need to relook at how we're thinking about this problem set and ask the question,
[01:32:16] how does this best serve the interests of the United States, our national security,
[01:32:19] the interest of the American people, instead of like, I got to look tough, I got to be strong,
[01:32:24] I got to pound my chest. And the, the unfortunate, and this is why I talk a lot about how the most
[01:32:31] important responsibility the president has is to serve as commander in chief and the danger of
[01:32:35] having a weak minded person in that position who does not understand the seriousness of that job
[01:32:42] is they feel they have to prove their strength and what better way to prove that strength
[01:32:48] than to say, Hey, I'm going to go drop some bombs. I'm going to go send in, you know, our, our meanest,
[01:32:54] baddest fighters to go into a certain situation or start a war, insert ourselves into a conflict
[01:32:59] without actually saying, Hey, maybe exercising restraint in the situation is actually the,
[01:33:06] not only the right move, but it's the power move. It's the move that actually serves the
[01:33:11] interest of our country. And that's, that's the dangerous consequence of exactly what you're
[01:33:16] talking about of ego and, and leaders making decisions based on emotion and fear, rather
[01:33:22] than actual assessment of, all right, what are we looking at? What are the consequences of course
[01:33:26] of action, a, b, c, and d? And what exactly are we trying to accomplish?
[01:33:32] It's freaking depressing. Is there any, is there any freaking light at the end of the tunnel
[01:33:38] for our government? Yes. What is it? Us. The light, the light at the end of the tunnel is
[01:33:47] people who are frustrated by the status quo, people who are concerned for what kind of future
[01:33:54] that we want to leave behind for our kids, what kind of country you want them to grow up in?
[01:34:02] Be, when I say be the change, it's, it's recognized the vision that our founders had for this country
[01:34:08] that, you know, literally escaping control and being governed by a monarchy where the people
[01:34:16] had no say to forming this country based on the foundation of a self governed people.
[01:34:22] And what, what does that actually mean? What does that look like? It's we, the people, fulfilling
[01:34:27] our responsibility in selecting leaders who truly are a government of the people by the people and
[01:34:33] for the people. There's a lot of different ways that any one of us can get involved and, and, and
[01:34:37] be a part of that. But the basic, the bare minimum is cast your vote and do a little bit of work,
[01:34:45] just a little bit to make sure that the votes that you're casting are based on, you know,
[01:34:50] informed, you know, figure out, figure out what you, what you want. And this is not to say, you
[01:34:58] know, you'll hear in politics like, Oh, one side only wants to get their side out to vote and hopes
[01:35:03] everybody else stays home. The more we have this open marketplace of ideas, the more we exercise
[01:35:09] our rights and freedoms and make sure that our voices are heard, then we have the kind of robust
[01:35:14] democracy that, that our founders envisioned. Again, back to the depressing viewpoint over
[01:35:20] from Jaco is the game that gets played as far as the whole political system, the game that's getting
[01:35:29] played is not conducive to people, Hey, okay, this is what I'm thinking right now. And this is what
[01:35:37] my beliefs are, and I'm going to go out and vote. And therefore, if a bunch of people are thinking
[01:35:41] like me, then we'll probably do okay. The game that's being played is like it's all about how
[01:35:46] much money can you put into advertising and how much how many people can you get to vote? And
[01:35:51] what methodology is there for voting? I mean, some of the voting things are crazy. Some of the things
[01:35:56] that happen with with voting and the way voting takes place. So it seems like the game that the
[01:36:05] politicians are playing, there's, you know, the, that the people are just sort of pawns that are
[01:36:14] yep, here's what we're going to do to get the pawns to vote this way. And here's what the, we'll
[01:36:19] get the result that we want. All of that is absolutely true. And knowing that that is true
[01:36:26] and knowing that that's the case is so important for us to know as voters what we're being subjected
[01:36:31] to and why and is exactly to try to manipulate us to vote in the way that one side or the other
[01:36:37] wants us to. And knowing that, then we can take a step back and again, encourage that critical
[01:36:44] thinking, encourage that as you're getting information, whether it's on a television ad or
[01:36:49] a social media post or a news article, exercise your own discernment and pause for a minute,
[01:36:57] think about, okay, well, what, what is their bias? What are they, what do they want me to think? Or
[01:37:03] how do they want me to react to this? There are, there's some apps out there. I know there's,
[01:37:08] there's a bunch, there's one that I have on my phone called Allsides. And it's an app that will
[01:37:13] present kind of the news headlines of the day. And it'll say, well, this new source is left
[01:37:19] leaning, this one is neutral, this one is right leaning. And it's not foolproof by any means,
[01:37:23] but there, there's some quick ways to kind of look out there and get a little bit of an idea of
[01:37:28] what direction or angle or bias a certain media source has taken so that you know, okay, well,
[01:37:35] if I read this, then okay, well, that's, that's kind of the outcome they want me to have. But
[01:37:39] being aware of that, I think is the first step. There are a lot of other policy changes that,
[01:37:44] that I think need to take place to address some of the problems that we're talking about. But
[01:37:48] that can only happen when we throw out leaders who are abusing their power and actually start to get
[01:37:55] real leaders into office who, who will take us in, in the right direction.
[01:38:01] When you say policy changes to address some of the things that have happened, what, like,
[01:38:05] what do you mean?
[01:38:07] I mean, the big tech, I think is, is a, is a huge one that as long as politicians are in the
[01:38:12] pockets and getting money from the Googles and meddas of the world, we're not going to see those
[01:38:18] kinds of changes take place. We hear a lot, I've heard a lot from both Democrats and Republicans
[01:38:23] about, oh, you know, big tech monopolies are such a big problem. It's like, yeah, okay, so
[01:38:28] what are you doing about it? And when you look at it, like, they're not, they're not doing
[01:38:33] anything about it. Actually, there's a, you know, a healthy debate and conversation needs to be
[01:38:38] had about how do you, you know, what role does government play in regulating these, these monopolies?
[01:38:46] I think first, you know, there's section 230 within the US code provides big tech, essentially,
[01:38:56] with the legal immunity that a publisher like the New York Times does not have. Because originally,
[01:39:02] they thought, okay, well, big tech, you know, like, they, they're not going to be, to be an
[01:39:07] arbiter and a curator of information, they're just going to be, you know, an online platform,
[01:39:12] whereas the New York Times does curate, you know, what letters to the editor they choose to publish
[01:39:16] or the articles they choose to publish. But in reality, in an application, these big tech
[01:39:22] monopolies are exactly, they're curating very, very carefully every single thing that we see.
[01:39:29] And yet they are not being held legally liable in the same way that a publisher would. So that's,
[01:39:35] that's kind of basic number one of like, okay, how should they be treated? Some say they should
[01:39:39] be treated as utility, much like the phone company where, you know, the phone company doesn't control
[01:39:45] who calls who or the content of any conversation. They are just a platform for us to be able to
[01:39:52] communicate and talk to each other. So I think, I think this big tech obviously does not want to
[01:39:59] lose that legal immunity. If they are a free speech platform, then be a free speech platform.
[01:40:06] If they're a platform that says, well, we're only going to push these certain viewpoints,
[01:40:10] then people know that and we'll know that going in. That's, that's a, that's an important place
[01:40:17] to start to make it so that these monopolies, I have been a big fan of breaking up big tech,
[01:40:25] breaking up a big tech using existing provisions within the law that
[01:40:32] like standard antitrust type. Exactly.
[01:40:35] To, to avoid exactly what we are seeing now, where you can say, oh, well, you know, you can use duck
[01:40:40] dot go instead of Google, but you're not going to get the same kind of effect and reach of being
[01:40:47] able to get as much information as you would because Google has a monopoly.
[01:40:51] I think there are different approaches to this, but recognizing the problem and how they're directly
[01:40:58] interfering in our elections. As one major example, we talked about Chloe Cole. There are other
[01:41:06] situations that like the Biden, the Hunter Biden laptop. Exactly. That's a great example.
[01:41:11] Is that not crazy? It's insane. It's insane. How, how, you know, for, for people who don't know,
[01:41:19] it was like just weeks before the general election in 2020, hugely consequential election.
[01:41:27] You have this discovery of a laptop that Hunter Biden left at a computer store.
[01:41:33] And then you have, I think it was at 50 or 51, either current or retired senior
[01:41:41] intelligence officials like people who headed the CIA coming out with a blanket statement saying
[01:41:47] that the contents of this laptop should not be released because it could be disinformation
[01:41:51] from Russia trying to influence the outcome of our election. And then, I don't know,
[01:41:58] was it the FBI who told Facebook not to? Yeah, I told Facebook to expect Russian propaganda in the,
[01:42:04] in the near future. Right. And then that kind of got put in with it. And Mark Zuckerberg on
[01:42:12] Rogan's podcast said, he, he said he didn't do what Twitter did was Twitter just, would just
[01:42:17] deleted any of those tweets that were pointing people in that direction. Facebook just downplayed
[01:42:23] it or deescalated its, its growth. So no one really saw it, which, which is essentially the same thing.
[01:42:29] Yeah. And that's like, you can't, that seems totally insane that that happened. Well, you think
[01:42:36] about why, why, why did they do this? It was because they were concerned. Oh yeah. That the
[01:42:43] information on the laptop would cause people to not vote for Joe Biden and instead vote for Donald
[01:42:49] Trump. Not a single one of those. I forget what news outlet it was, but they went back once the,
[01:42:58] obviously the election was over and the information on the laptop had been released,
[01:43:03] had gone back to any of those senior intelligence or all of them actually, they reached out to all
[01:43:08] of them to say, Hey, now that you know what you know, do you regret making the statement that
[01:43:13] you made blaming Russia on this? Uh, and many of them didn't respond to the question. Those that
[01:43:20] did not a single one of them said, I regret it or I was wrong. Not a single one of them. Most of
[01:43:26] them saying, well, I stand by my statement. This is, this is such an egregious, I mean, this has to,
[01:43:34] this has to be called out for, for what it is. This is people in, in major positions of power
[01:43:41] and influence, essentially stealing our democracy, stealing our right as voters, voters to have all
[01:43:47] the information available to us before making this hugely consequential, consequential decision on
[01:43:51] who our president should be. But yet this is the problem, right? This is the game that you're
[01:43:56] talking about. This is the problem is like no one's holding these people to account. No one's
[01:43:59] holding their feet to the fire. No one's demanding like, Hey, you know, you, you have completely
[01:44:05] discredited yourself if you're not willing to say, Hey, I was wrong. Yeah, that's like one of the
[01:44:10] solowlinsky again, one of the rules and he's got a whole section that's not just one of his rules.
[01:44:15] He's got a whole section on the rules of the means to an end. And it's basically, if you're
[01:44:20] going to, you do whatever it takes, you do whatever it takes to get to what you want. And that's why
[01:44:25] people, you know, in that situation, they go, No, I don't, I don't regret my statement because
[01:44:30] it's a means to an end. And they got what they wanted, which was to get a bunch of people not
[01:44:36] to see information that may affect the way that they vote. And that is such a dangerous, dangerous
[01:44:42] mindset, dangerous mindset where again, it's, it's so short-sighted because you know that that's
[01:44:49] true. And I've talked to people personally who have said like, you know, there's they will do
[01:44:55] anything and everything to pretend to prevent Donald Trump from getting elected president.
[01:44:59] And he's not, he is, he is, he's very hated by, by a bunch of people.
[01:45:04] Hated as it lightly, lightly.
[01:45:05] There's a level of hatred that's just, it's blinding.
[01:45:09] It's blinding, right?
[01:45:10] It's blinding. And that's how short-sighted that mentality is. So, you know, means to an end,
[01:45:16] use whatever means available and necessary to prevent that specific outcome. Turn the tables
[01:45:22] around. What about when you're on the other end of that stick and you have the opposing side saying,
[01:45:29] hey, now it's your side that we believe is the most dangerous thing for America.
[01:45:35] We're willing to do whatever it takes to stop you or whoever your advocate or whatever,
[01:45:39] whatever the case may be. That is such a dangerous mentality to have. And there are examples
[01:45:46] throughout history of authoritarian dictators who themselves believe like, I am the righteous one.
[01:45:54] I am the savior. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes because only I know what's best for the
[01:46:01] people. Are you tracking the FTX meltdown at all? The Bitcoin thing?
[01:46:06] Marginally. I've read kind of the top lines on it.
[01:46:09] But yeah, but look, it's, I don't even know what today is. I think it's the 22nd of November.
[01:46:14] But and so this case is unwinding as we speak. But right now it looks bad because these people
[01:46:23] were, they set up a big Ponzi scheme for all practical purposes. And with money from that
[01:46:29] Ponzi scheme, the, they were the number two donor to the Democratic Party. Right.
[01:46:36] Second only to George Soros. So and, and this guy, the guy that was running it, Sam, whatever,
[01:46:46] he's, he's, he's this big donor. And then they were setting him up. He was the one that was going
[01:46:52] to advise the government on how they should structure regulatory environment around digital
[01:46:59] currency. I mean, this is, this is going to get ugly. But that's the kind of situation where
[01:47:06] you're, you know, on the outside, you, if you're a normal person in America and you're working on
[01:47:11] your farm or you're working in your factory or you're doing construction or whatever it is you're
[01:47:15] doing, you're, you're not thinking that there's just straight doctor evil shit going on where this
[01:47:22] dude's paying to have all these people elected. I mean, you don't think that $100 million has
[01:47:29] an impact on, on the way an election turns out. I mean, that's having a huge impact, a huge impact.
[01:47:37] And so here's this guy and now he's getting, oh yeah, you donated money. So we're going to let
[01:47:41] you set up the regulations around cryptocurrency, which is the business that you're in, which is what,
[01:47:48] and again, I'm not following the case too close. And it's really early and not a lot of it's come
[01:47:52] out. But one of the other crypto dudes, CZ, some guy named CZ, he was like, oh, you're, he, uh,
[01:48:00] Sam was trying to set the gig up for himself. Of course. It wasn't out of like this altruism of
[01:48:07] like blockchain technology and cryptocurrency and you know, all of, you know, for people who are,
[01:48:12] are big advocates of that and the opportunity they see for that in the world of technology,
[01:48:16] that was not his, did not appear to be his motivation. And this dude, CZ was like, oh,
[01:48:22] I see what you're trying to do. And he is the one that kind of caused this whole thing to far,
[01:48:26] fall apart, which now, of course, you think, well, thankfully it fell apart when it did,
[01:48:31] because it was a big house of cards anyways. But as you look at this, like I said, as a normal human
[01:48:35] that lives in America, and you, you don't think that there's Dr. Evil shit going down where people
[01:48:42] are buying elections, you're thinking that things are like, Hey, this is America. And the fact of
[01:48:48] the matter is there is this kind of thing going on. There is this massive amount of influence.
[01:48:52] The big tech really is doing this kind of thing. The, the politicians really are bought. And by the way,
[01:49:00] that company gave money to Republicans as well. They were hedging their bets. They should have
[01:49:05] hedged their bets better with their freaking Bitcoin, by the way, because it ended up causing,
[01:49:09] but they had their bets Republican and Democrat more, much more to the Democrats,
[01:49:13] probably because they thought, Oh, well, Democrats are going to be in power. So we better support
[01:49:17] them right now. And, and so I think that's what's really disturbing. This game is being played.
[01:49:23] The surface of it, you know, we all think it's on the up and up. And as soon as you look below
[01:49:28] the surface, it's dirty. And it's corrupt. And it's disgusting. Yeah. That pay to play. I mean,
[01:49:37] it's, it's a perfect example of the whole pay to play mentality that that is so relevant in Washington.
[01:49:42] I think last time we, I was on your show, we talked a little bit about big pharma.
[01:49:46] Same thing. You look at how is it possible that, that still big pharma has so much power
[01:49:52] and so much influence in Washington, they get sweet deals so that they can make more profits,
[01:49:57] even when you're looking at government purchases of government of healthcare buying,
[01:50:02] buying prescription drugs. They're, I think most people in society recognize that this kind of
[01:50:08] outsize influence is wrong. And it's counter to the public interest. And yet many members of
[01:50:15] Congress are bought off by big pharma and they won't take those votes. They won't take those
[01:50:20] votes that hurt the people who give them their campaign donations and give them their campaign
[01:50:24] checks. Big pharma spends more money on political contributions and lobbying than they do on those
[01:50:33] crazy television ads that we see all the time of like, you know, the happy family frolicking in
[01:50:39] the meadow, promoting whatever the drug may be. Side effects might be suicidal ideations,
[01:50:46] massive diarrhea. And I don't think you can turn on, I don't think you can watch like one commercial
[01:50:53] like segment without seeing at least one prescription drug ad. And you think about the fact
[01:50:58] that how like TV ads are expensive, very expensive. And then you think about, well, gosh, they're
[01:51:04] spending multiple times that amount to influence, to buy influence in our government to protect
[01:51:10] themselves. How does a politician put money in their own pocket from a big pharma?
[01:51:15] I think there's a spectrum there. You know, those who are actually following all the laws
[01:51:24] make it so that those kinds of contributions make it so that they are getting the vast majority of
[01:51:30] the money in their political campaign, which gives them security against any potential challenger
[01:51:37] are coming from these big corporations and lobbyists rather than from voters. So that's kind
[01:51:43] of the first thing if you look at like, Hey, if you're following the letter of the law, even then
[01:51:48] you're protecting your own self interest rather than what's the interest of the people in your
[01:51:52] constituency who are actually the ones who are hiring you. You look at the most one of the most
[01:51:57] egregious examples is where politicians will take money in their campaign and
[01:52:06] either live in the gray space of like, Oh, well, you know, and there are examples of this like,
[01:52:11] I'm going to use campaign money to pay for my spouse's salary because my spouse is helping
[01:52:18] out on the campaign, or I'm going to use, you know, $100,000 to pay for childcare because
[01:52:24] by paying for childcare, then I can go out and work on my campaign. There was somebody that I
[01:52:30] worked with in Congress who used, I mean, he actually got convicted because he was breaking
[01:52:37] the law, but used hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay his rent to pay for dental bills for his
[01:52:44] family to pay for all kinds of personal expenses. And, and, you know, still to this day, he's just
[01:52:51] like, Oh, this is a witch hunt. This is, you know, they're coming after me because they don't like
[01:52:55] what I'm saying. Like, no, dude, you broke the law, you know, but there's, there's a whole spectrum
[01:53:00] there. I think all of which end up in a place where, you know, these are self serving interests
[01:53:05] rather than actually being accountable to, to your voters.
[01:53:10] How do you, because I get asked this, how do you square up the distrust of the government
[01:53:20] with, I'm going to serve in the armed forces? The question I get asked a lot. Yeah. And, and I
[01:53:26] answer it, but how, how do you answer that? You're, you're not active duty, but you're a current
[01:53:31] reservist. You go on active duty on a pretty regular basis. And yet you know the, you know what,
[01:53:37] how the sausage is made in Washington, DC. How do you square those two opposing things that are
[01:53:44] going on? I'm proud to wear the uniform of this country and the American flag. I'm proud to
[01:53:54] do my part in upholding that oath that we take when we enlist in the service. I'm honored to serve
[01:54:03] with great Americans who share that same mission and those ideals. I have, because I'm in the
[01:54:12] reserves and not active duty, I'm in the unique position of also being able to try to effect
[01:54:18] change in the political sense, recognizing we have a civilian led military in trying to lead our
[01:54:25] country in the right direction to where we are honoring that vision that our founders had for
[01:54:33] us, that we were honoring the service and sacrifice being made by our brothers and sisters
[01:54:37] in uniform and their families. And that we are making the best decisions that serve our own
[01:54:43] national security interests and the freedom and prosperity of the American people. When we have
[01:54:53] people in politics who are so compromised by the military industrial complex or one interest or
[01:54:58] another that is not the interests of the country and the American people, obviously those in the
[01:55:05] military are the ones who suffer the consequences when they make self-serving decisions.
[01:55:10] Even as somebody who served in Iraq like you, whether we agree or disagree with those decisions
[01:55:18] that are made by those civilians in leadership, it does not undermine the promise that we make
[01:55:25] to each other and to the Constitution as we continue to fulfill that promise.
[01:55:32] Yeah, obviously for me besides the just freaking awesome job that it is being in the military,
[01:55:42] which I loved being in the military, but when you're in the military, you have an opportunity to
[01:55:49] sort of mitigate the bad decisions that get made and you also get the opportunity to shape the
[01:55:56] military itself. So when you're in the military, you can do a much better job of taking people and
[01:56:03] like getting people the right mindset that's going to be beneficial for the country and for
[01:56:09] whatever country we're going into as opposed to if you're not in the military and you're sitting on
[01:56:14] the outside saying, well, it should be like this. Well, if you're in the military, you can actually
[01:56:18] make some of those things happen and you can do it within the guidelines that are set forth by the
[01:56:23] military, but you can do it in a positive way. So I guess that's how I always tried to square
[01:56:28] myself. It's so true. It's so true. And right now, I'm grateful to I often have the opportunity to go
[01:56:36] and provide in the Army, they call it LPD. It's like leadership professional development
[01:56:40] sessions with either soldiers who are going through training pipelines or those who are out in the
[01:56:46] force for exactly that purpose to hopefully have an impact in helping make sure that we have discerning
[01:56:56] leaders in the military, not just robots who aren't actually thinking through the kind of
[01:57:01] responsibility that they have, regardless of their rank as they're carrying out their task
[01:57:07] and their mission. The other cool thing for you is you being able to explain to leaders in the
[01:57:12] military, hey, this is what it looks like from the governmental side. You should probably go
[01:57:16] brief every military, you know, what's going on with that. Because I mean, even when I was in,
[01:57:21] I would kind of get trying grasp that and try and explain to people, hey, this is what it looks
[01:57:26] like from a political perspective. But for you, that's, that's you have the real experience to
[01:57:31] say, hey, this is why we're getting asked to do this. This is what it looks like. Here's what it
[01:57:35] took to get this decision made. Here's why we need to execute it. Here's what happens if we don't.
[01:57:40] So that's, it's pretty. It is. And, and, you know, I've had the opportunity to work a lot
[01:57:45] within the special operations community, particularly because they are looking for this
[01:57:50] kind of insight. And one thing I've really appreciated, especially in the special operations
[01:57:54] community versus the conventional military, which is not where it's not really encouraged so much,
[01:57:59] but really that problem solving mindset, a little bit of that challenging mindset where,
[01:58:05] you know, being a robot is discouraged. You are actually encouraged and incentivized to be somebody
[01:58:10] who's like, Hey, how can we do this better? Or why is this actually the best way? Or how was this
[01:58:15] decision made, whether you're an NCO or an officer? And I just having that encouraging that critical
[01:58:21] thinking and recognizing again, the impact that you have on people is, is so important. And I
[01:58:26] wish it was something that was more encouraged across the military as a whole.
[01:58:30] What are you right now, a Lieutenant Colonel? Yeah.
[01:58:35] When do you up for Colonel, Full Bird Colonel?
[01:58:40] I think the window opens maybe in about a year or two.
[01:58:47] Yeah, I'm not exactly sure, but we'll see that the results of the command board are supposed to
[01:58:54] come out any day now. And if I have, if I have, I'll find out if I have the privilege of being
[01:59:00] selected to be a battalion commander for a civil affairs reserve battalion.
[01:59:04] What are your chances? Is it like, how hard is it to get selected for that?
[01:59:09] It all depends on in the reserves. It's a little bit different than the active duty where,
[01:59:15] obviously you've got to be able to balance your time with whatever your civilian job or
[01:59:18] profession might be with, with the responsibilities of being a battalion commander.
[01:59:24] So it kind of depends on how many people are opting in or out on any given year.
[01:59:29] But there's a lot more. It is competitive. It is competitive.
[01:59:32] So if you get picked up as a reservist battalion commander,
[01:59:36] how much time do you have to spend active as a battalion commander? Do you have to do more?
[01:59:42] On paper, you have the same minimum requirement of the one weekend a month, two weeks a year.
[01:59:49] But a friend of mine was selected last year. He's a little bit ahead of me.
[01:59:53] And there's a lot of love time, as we say, there's a lot of love time.
[01:59:59] Because in a reserve unit, you rely a lot on your full-time staff, the full-time reservists who are
[02:00:05] running the staff shops, the personnel shop, the operation shop, and supply and everything else.
[02:00:10] And he's going to give me his best practices because he's just like, yeah, he runs his own
[02:00:16] business. It's kind of, and his business is doing very well. He has different projects around the
[02:00:21] world. And he's also a reserve battalion commander. And he's just like, yeah, it's a lot. It's a lot.
[02:00:26] But it's freaking awesome. Yeah. And so other than that, what else you got going on right now?
[02:00:39] What else are we doing? You got the Tulsi Gabbard show, which you finally launched.
[02:00:44] I know. It took forever. You came and talked to Echo and I about that. I think that's why you
[02:00:47] stopped by. You came by to suck our brains on how to do a podcast. And Echo decided to give you
[02:00:55] all of his advice. Yeah. I took notes. We took all of the advice. After that, I ended up getting
[02:01:04] deployed to East Africa and was gone for a while and then came back and just, you know, a lot of
[02:01:09] things happened. But yeah, finally pushed it out. And it's just, you know, I mean, it's such a great
[02:01:16] opportunity and platform to be able to dive into, you know, different issues, different topics,
[02:01:22] have great conversations. And so, you know, where people like, you know, like the guy in the, you
[02:01:29] know, the coffee shop in Greensboro, he's like, Oh my God, why don't you leave a different kind of,
[02:01:32] oh, okay, go listen. This episode one will tell you exactly the answer to what you're looking for.
[02:01:38] How often are you doing the podcast? Come out once a week?
[02:01:40] Once a week, every Tuesday. Push out a new episode every Tuesday.
[02:01:43] And where are you recording them? Wherever? I am for the most part recording at home in Hawaii.
[02:01:51] We got rid of a living room. We lived in a tiny two bedroom place and decided that having a studio
[02:01:56] was more practical than having a living room. Literally, we're like, if we're just sitting
[02:02:02] around on the couch, we're not, we're not using our time very well. So we got rid of the couch and
[02:02:08] my husband's a cinematographer. So he put together a studio. And so I'm sure there will be on the
[02:02:12] road ones at different points, but so far doing them from home. And then what do you have a
[02:02:17] sub stack? Did I see that? Yeah. So just recognize, you know, like my whole approach is there's so
[02:02:23] many different platforms that people get information from. And some people like to listen to podcasts.
[02:02:28] Other people don't like podcasts and they, they would rather watch cable news and other people
[02:02:32] don't like any of that and would rather read. And so for each of the episodes at a minimum for each
[02:02:39] of the podcasts that I'm putting out that I'm talking about a different issue, I jot down
[02:02:44] my notes and put them out on sub stack for people who just want to get a little bit of a summary
[02:02:50] of where I stand on certain things or my thoughts or views on, on a, something that might be
[02:02:56] happening in the news or something like that. And then YouTube, you're on YouTube. We're on
[02:03:01] YouTube on rumble and, and you're, oh yeah, no, you're on rumble rumble. Echo Charles. What's up? Oh,
[02:03:09] we're on rumble. Wait, you think we're on rumble? Cause I know I talked about getting us on rumble.
[02:03:14] Yeah. Oh, I can think of some matter of how many episodes are on rumble. Okay. So we're kind of on
[02:03:19] rumble. Let me double check that for a minute. Okay. I appreciate that one. Circle back.
[02:03:24] He'll say that. And then you're doing some spots on Fox news. You sat in for Tucker, Tucker
[02:03:31] Carlson the other night. Yeah. Second time he hour, he or his team asked for me to, to guest
[02:03:39] host for him when he was off. And that, that man, that's a new experience. I've never done that before
[02:03:46] anywhere else. And, um, hosting an hour, 44 minutes when you count in, you know, commercials
[02:03:54] of live television is definitely a new experience. A different level of like,
[02:04:00] there ain't no room for mistakes. It's a thing. It's a thing that, it's a thing that people have.
[02:04:05] Some people are good at it. Like when you, when you go and you see what the, what the news,
[02:04:12] what are they called? Newscasters, broadcasters. What are they called? Hosts. What are they called?
[02:04:16] Yeah. He would be a host because, you know, he's more on the opinion side of things than like
[02:04:22] your, your Brett bear on Fox is a little bit more of like a news kind of more of a straight news guy.
[02:04:27] When you see what that job, I would not like that job. Yeah. Do you like it? I had a lot more
[02:04:34] fun than I expected to have, to be honest. I, it was, it was certainly a lot of, because, you know,
[02:04:38] you know, his show is on every night and obviously Tucker's been doing this forever and he's,
[02:04:43] he's, you know, good at it. I'd say, I mean, he has the top rated show on Fox news. And so,
[02:04:51] you know, for me going in, I sometimes they have guest hosts who literally just show up and then
[02:04:57] they get given the whatever's going to be on the teleprompter. I'm not, I don't, I wouldn't do that
[02:05:05] for anybody. If I'm reading words on a teleprompter, they're going to be words that I wrote. And so,
[02:05:10] working with his team to write and structure the show, you know, all within the span of like
[02:05:17] a six hour timeframe, it's a lot, it's a lot. And, but it's, look, I mean, I actually did end up having,
[02:05:26] having fun just, just taking advantage of the opportunity to be able to share my own views
[02:05:32] on what's happening and have conversations with people. It is challenging and like, okay, you
[02:05:37] get four minutes to talk to somebody and you got somebody in your ear. Like literally, like I asked
[02:05:42] the first question, the producers like, okay, you have 90 seconds. Like, okay, rap, rap, rap. And I'm
[02:05:48] like, Oh my God, like I would love to either challenge what they're saying or ask another
[02:05:53] follow up or whatever. And it is the weirdest me and my buddy, Leif, who I wrote books with.
[02:05:58] And when his wife worked at Fox News and Jenna Lee. And so I would, when I would go to New York,
[02:06:06] you know, a lot of times I would just stay with them. And so I would kind of see her schedule
[02:06:11] and life. And I was like, Oh my God, it's grueling. It's grueling. I didn't want anything to do with
[02:06:18] that. So even the one hour session one, now I guess you're going to get good. A person would get
[02:06:25] better at it, you know, and you could see that Jenna, she was totally comfortable with it. I mean,
[02:06:28] it's just the way it is. It's just like anything. Yeah. Just like anything else. You're gonna get
[02:06:31] used to it. But that's a, you know, have you ever been on Maria's show? Maria Bartolomou?
[02:06:36] I have. Yeah. That, that I was so impressed with that woman when I've gone on her show, gone on
[02:06:41] her show a number of times. And she's just, she's got to be so smart. Yeah. I would sit there though.
[02:06:48] Because you know, you're watching her beforehand, you're watching her in between. Because like you
[02:06:51] said, in between, they're like, Hey, we got this one. And here's these numbers. And then like,
[02:06:55] boom, the camera goes back on, the red light comes on and she's all just squared away with
[02:06:58] everything she's saying. Yeah. It's pretty, it's a different kind of human. You can tell
[02:07:02] the skill. I guess there's a certain, you know, like Michael Jordan is going to be good at basketball.
[02:07:07] There's a certain type of human being that's going to be good at that job. Yeah. You've got to be,
[02:07:12] I mean, obviously you've got to be very focused and you've got to be able to discern kind of the,
[02:07:18] of all of the, the activity and voice in your ears and everything else that's going on. You got to
[02:07:23] be able to separate kind of the noise from the task at hand and not allow yourself to be shaken
[02:07:31] or distracted by whatever is going on around you. And that's, that's part of it. So are you going
[02:07:38] to do it more? We'll see. They say they, they've been pretty happy with it. And so they're saying
[02:07:45] like, okay, well, we look forward to having you do it more often. We used to catch a lot of crap for
[02:07:50] going on Fox news. Like it was, I, even I have, because I've got, I go on Fox news, I still go
[02:07:58] on Fox news. You know, many times CNN has asked me to be on CNN zero zero zero. Yeah.
[02:08:05] Yeah. Same thing with any other Fox news. MSNBC. MSNBC. They don't ask me to come on and talk to
[02:08:12] them. Yeah. That's, but you, I mean, I guess, the same thing. Yeah. It's the same thing. You know,
[02:08:18] it, it towards the end of my, well, first of all, like throughout the entire time that I was in
[02:08:23] Congress, you know, I, I was asked on all, all three of the different networks over the years,
[02:08:30] the invitations have shifted and changed based on whatever I was advocating for. If like CNN
[02:08:37] wasn't really going after it, then like, Oh, I wonder why I don't hear from this show or that
[02:08:43] show that literally happened to you. Literally. And noticeably, when you first showed up as a
[02:08:48] Congresswoman, you were kind of like a little bit of a kind of a rising star, right? So they say,
[02:08:54] so you were a rising star. Were you just, were they calling you all the time? All the time. And I
[02:08:58] just like, I was just, you know, over the years, people are like, Oh, you know, who's your publicist?
[02:09:05] Who's doing all this? I was like, my phone's just ringing. I don't have a publicist. I have somebody
[02:09:11] who used to be like a communications intern who's answering the phone calls, but it was very, very
[02:09:17] unexpected. And I was just like, okay, like I'll take advantage. Like if it makes sense, then I'll
[02:09:22] take advantage of this platform to be able to say what I want to say. But it was a palpable shift
[02:09:29] over the years as, you know, I would, I would speak out on a certain issue or, you know, I didn't
[02:09:36] support Hillary Clinton in 2016. And that was like, Oh, okay. Well, it was literally considered
[02:09:42] blasphemy and politics. And then again, in, in 2020, when I ran for president,
[02:09:50] it was, you know, I saw this shift just throughout that campaign, where there was already a negative
[02:09:57] bias towards me from the day that I announced my candidacy, because I had a track record of being
[02:10:03] somebody who called it straight and was very outspoken against the foreign policy establishment
[02:10:09] in Washington and their decisions. And that, that progressed throughout the campaign where it got to
[02:10:16] a point where instead of even covering me or instead of mentioning, Hey, this person is a
[02:10:21] candidate for president, they just stopped including my name and articles about Democrats
[02:10:25] running for president completely as though I didn't exist. It was a media blackout at a certain
[02:10:30] point throughout the time. Fox News consistently has been a platform where I've been invited on
[02:10:38] consistently. Did they invite you to talk about issues that you weren't disagreement with them?
[02:10:43] Yeah. Yeah. Over the years. They just didn't care. And they didn't care. And one thing that,
[02:10:47] that I've heard from different hosts of different shows, and even some of the, you know, like the
[02:10:52] executives at Fox is like, Tulsa, we really like having you on because we never know what you're
[02:10:56] going to say. Literally. You are unpredictable. And, and that's why our audience likes you.
[02:11:03] Because you're, you're interesting person. You have something interesting to say that's not just
[02:11:06] like one party's talking points or, you know, whatever the popular thing is of the day. And I
[02:11:13] think that, that says something about media as a whole. But the fact that they, they just say,
[02:11:19] come on and say your piece. I go on and say my piece, whether the host degrees or disagrees,
[02:11:22] maybe that's part of the conversation, but it's not, it's not the deciding factor of, of whether
[02:11:27] they have me on or not. But the other news networks, it was a deciding factor. Oh, absolutely. I mean,
[02:11:32] I, and that's the people on social media like, Oh, how come you're always on Fox News? You know,
[02:11:35] you're letting them take advantage of you and all this other stuff. It's like, no, I'm taking advantage
[02:11:39] of the platform. Number one, because they reach millions of people more than any other cable news
[02:11:44] network. And number two, CNN and MSNBC, they don't, they, they haven't asked me on their air for years
[02:11:51] on any issue. Like Eve, I've reached out once on veterans issues, toxic burn pits, things,
[02:11:55] things that I've worked on in Congress and still really passionate about and trying to advance.
[02:12:01] No interest whatsoever. That's like kind of crazy, isn't it? Yeah, it's very revealing,
[02:12:09] very revealing. So you would reach out to CNN and say, Hey, I would like to talk to you about
[02:12:14] the veterans that have been around these toxic burn pits and now they've got diseases.
[02:12:18] Would you like to do this? I think they'd be like, no,
[02:12:21] the response I got back, and this was the, that was the last time I reached out. The response I
[02:12:25] got back was like, Oh, interesting. Let me check with the producers and then radio silence. Like
[02:12:30] they didn't, they didn't have the balls to come back and say like, yeah, no, thanks. Not interested.
[02:12:34] It was just like no response. Well, you have your own platform now, right? You got the, the podcast,
[02:12:42] the YouTube channel, the, the sub stack thing going on. TulsiGabber.com. You're on there.
[02:12:51] TulsiGabber.com. I'm working on a book right now as well. Two books actually focused on
[02:13:01] While of the Democratic Party and the other book focused on the cost of war.
[02:13:05] Or do you already have a publisher for these? I do. Sweet. And so when are these things coming
[02:13:09] out? Working on the sequencing. But I hope to have one of the books out by, I don't know,
[02:13:18] early next year, spring. What about politics in your future? I don't know. I don't know,
[02:13:25] is the honest answer. It's, I want to be in a position where I can best make a positive impact
[02:13:36] and where I feel I can best serve. I am terribly concerned for all of the reasons that we've talked
[02:13:44] about today about the failure. It's not even a lack of leadership. It's, it's, it's a sincere failure
[02:13:51] of leadership in this country. And if there is a way for me to actually directly impact that
[02:14:04] leadership, then I will pursue that, whether that means I'm running for office or trying to impact
[02:14:13] those who are in office. We'll see. The vehicle is, is less important than the impact to me.
[02:14:25] But you may go back into politics? Sure.
[02:14:28] All right. What is it? Echo? Yes. What do you got? Anything else?
[02:14:36] No, I was going to ask that. You will be running for anything or, you know, thinking about it or
[02:14:40] what? But, you know, we got that answer. We're still surfing, obviously. Yes. Water woman never
[02:14:45] died. But no, water woman is alive as well. A lot lately. A lot. I've been on the road in the last
[02:14:52] two months. I've probably been home, I don't know, two weeks out of that period of time.
[02:14:59] You spend a lot of time campaigning for people too. Yes. Which was, you know, after I announced
[02:15:05] that I was leaving the Democratic Party, becoming an independent, my phone started ringing off the
[02:15:11] hook from people in what, you know, what they call the swing states, the states that can either go
[02:15:16] Democrat or Republican, a lot of close races and people inviting me to come out and help campaign
[02:15:24] for them, recognizing that there are a lot of undecided people, whether they're independents
[02:15:29] or Democrats or Republicans who are frustrated with the current state of affairs and current
[02:15:34] leadership. And so, yeah, I reached out to you mostly. Democrats or Republicans? Republicans.
[02:15:40] Did any Democrats reach out to you? No. If they had, if there were, if there were a Democrat
[02:15:46] running for Congress who was openly calling out the insanity of the Democrat leadership of today
[02:15:54] and taking a strong stand on the things we're talking about, on basic fundamentals of freedom,
[02:16:00] I would have happily gone and campaigned for them. Not a single one reached out. And I've been looking.
[02:16:06] I've been looking for those courageous voices to actually step out. And unfortunately,
[02:16:14] that hasn't been there. And I've heard from some people privately, just and really over the last
[02:16:23] few years who are saying, hey, thank you so much for speaking out on these things. I appreciate
[02:16:29] what you're doing, but also don't tell anyone. And so it's sad, it's unfortunate, but part of
[02:16:36] like the last thing I said in my announcement of leading the Democratic Party is I invite other
[02:16:41] Democrats to join me. Has anyone? Not yet. Not yet. All right. So I guess we should real quick
[02:16:56] talk about supporting this podcast. Of course, you're going to support Tosca's podcast, but if
[02:17:00] you want to support this podcast, you want to support America and you want to support yourself,
[02:17:05] you can. You can do it. We got a bunch of different ways for you to do it. How has your
[02:17:09] energy drink been? Love it. So you immediately went for a mango flavor, which is the,
[02:17:16] I mean, is it safe to say this is more of a Hawaiian vibe? Yeah, especially with the lily
[02:17:20] quay in there. A passion fruit. Okay. So we got a little bit of that going on. You can get this stuff
[02:17:27] from DrFuel.com. You can get it at Wawa. You can get it at Vitamin Shop. You can get it. We're
[02:17:32] in all military commissaries. I've noticed that. I was in the commissary at Kanyoya Marine Corp.
[02:17:39] Week and a half ago, and I almost took a picture. I was like, Hey, we're about to be in the exchanges
[02:17:46] too, which is cool. Cause if you're in the military, you know, the commissaries basically
[02:17:51] families go to commissaries. Like the young enlisted guys, they're not going to the commissary. It
[02:17:56] takes too much time or whatever, but they go to the exchange exchange, you know, they sell gas and
[02:18:00] whatever beer. So now you can get some jockel fuel. You will be able to in the very near future.
[02:18:08] Is there a red taped process to get into like a store? There is. So like, I was at a shop,
[02:18:18] the other, I don't know, Wico or whatever. And they're like, Hey, bring those energy drinks
[02:18:22] we want to sell them or whatever. I can't just be like, Oh, I got something at home and bring them.
[02:18:26] Right. Or can wait, which store was it? Like a local? Yeah. Yeah. San Diego disc.
[02:18:33] Yeah. We just, we dig, we dig a wholesale. So if anybody wants to do wholesale, this is like,
[02:18:38] if you got a store, you got a gym, you got a jiu-jitsu academy, you can go to J F sales
[02:18:45] at jockel fuel.com and email that and you get a wholesale account set up and, and that,
[02:18:49] then you can do it. Okay. So that's more for the store really. Right. Yeah. The
[02:18:54] the, uh, yeah, a little bit, but not really. I mean, when somebody wants to bring something
[02:18:58] into their store, they can just get a wholesale account and set up. Now, if they have a big chain
[02:19:02] store, that's where it run. That's where you run into. And at some point, I got to do some kind
[02:19:06] of a podcast about what it goes on. That'd be interesting because for instance, we're, so
[02:19:14] it's kind of cool. It's kind of complimentary when you start making a dent. All of a sudden,
[02:19:20] the big, the big giant billion dollar corporations realized that you're making a dent and they
[02:19:25] come after you. So for instance, I don't know how much I can say about this, but I'll say a little
[02:19:31] bit, uh, in one particular store that we're in, one of the big companies came in and paid millions
[02:19:38] of dollars, millions of dollars for our slots in, in this particular store and like slots,
[02:19:46] meaning room on the shelf, room on the shelf. Interesting. They said,
[02:19:48] we really don't want Jocko Fuel to be out there. We don't, we see what they're doing.
[02:19:53] We see their growth. We don't like it. We have to go on the offense. And so they paid millions and
[02:19:58] millions of dollars to take our shelf space from us. And, and, and I can't even be mad at the store
[02:20:04] because the store is trying to make profit and they're trying to do what they're doing.
[02:20:08] And they also have to keep a relationship with the big giant companies. Otherwise,
[02:20:12] they won't be able to supply things that those big giant companies put out there. So
[02:20:17] that's what happens. That's the fight we're in right now. It's kind of cool because it means
[02:20:22] you're, you're, you're, you're growing to a point where, and people, the weird thing is people kind
[02:20:27] of all these big companies. And when I say big companies, I'm not men singing. I'm talking about
[02:20:33] the biggest companies there are. They know what we're doing. They're, they're now taking active
[02:20:39] countermeasures to try and shut us down because they know that kind of on a, on a product,
[02:20:45] we, they can't beat us because we held the line. We're making it good for you. We're doing all
[02:20:51] these things that they're not going to do. They would rather sacrifice millions of dollars to
[02:20:56] buy that shelf space than pay, create a better product. So that says a lot about competition.
[02:21:02] That's what we're up against. And cool, like this is it. This is what we're doing. And we're going
[02:21:09] to have some setbacks like that. But the cool thing is the product is better. We know it's
[02:21:16] better. They know it's better. Otherwise they would just go toe to toe, right? It's be like,
[02:21:20] cool, let's do this, but they don't want to do that. Man, there, there are some interesting
[02:21:25] parallels to what we were talking about, about substance versus trying to silence or push out
[02:21:32] anybody who has a counter. Yeah. Same. I mean, you're seeing it play out. Seeing it play out.
[02:21:37] And, but it is crazy. And that's why big corporations with billy, with a B billions of
[02:21:44] dollars, they do their best to destroy the smaller companies that are growing. And that's the way
[02:21:52] it is. And we'll see how it plays out. I can tell you how it's playing out right now. It's playing
[02:21:56] out good because we're going to continue to make the best product. We're going to continue to grow.
[02:22:01] And we, and the cool thing is the demand signal, the demand signal. That's what like in this particular
[02:22:07] store that I'm talking about. And it's a, it's a whole group of stores, but they, they took some
[02:22:13] slots, the big billion dollar corporation took some slots, but the store wouldn't give up all of
[02:22:19] them. They took some, but they said, Hey man, people are in here every day for that dock of fuel.
[02:22:22] We're not giving this up. We're not taking this away from our customers. Yeah. We can't just
[02:22:26] screw over our customers. We can screw them over a little bit, but we can't screw them all the way
[02:22:31] over. So they kept a bunch of, a bunch of our product in the store, but not as much as we wanted,
[02:22:37] but it's fine. It's fine. So if you want to support America and you want to support the growing
[02:22:44] companies, you want to support people that are growing things in America, then jocofuel.com.
[02:22:48] It's the same thing with origin USA, origin USA.com. And by the way, next time you're in North
[02:22:53] Carolina, you got to go to our factory. I know. I've been talking to Pete and I think we, we
[02:22:57] may have something planned in December. We'll see. Good. Origin. I was supposed to go down there.
[02:23:01] I was supposed to go to the North Carolina factory for veterans day. I said, I went to the main
[02:23:04] factory because there was a freaking hurricane hitting North Carolina. So I couldn't go down
[02:23:08] there. But yeah, next time you're down there, it's the same thing. The billion dollar corporations
[02:23:14] see what we're doing. The weird thing is they, they're, they saw what we were doing and like
[02:23:21] before we were even doing very much, they were threatened. And I think it's, I think it's because
[02:23:29] the truth is so threatening. And when you have someone that's like, no, actually, you can't
[02:23:33] build this stuff in America. And when for years they say, you can't do it, you can't do it, you
[02:23:37] can't, they're, they're, they're lying. And so now there's someone saying, oh yeah, look at this
[02:23:42] over here. Look what we're actually doing right now, 100% America. Look, and they, they are scared.
[02:23:48] And so since day one, they've been onto us. The, the, the food companies, they're kind of taking
[02:23:54] notice in the last six months where they're like, oh, shit. The, the clothing companies,
[02:24:02] they've been honest because they're scared because we're doing everything right and they're doing
[02:24:06] everything wrong. And that's just all there is to it. I think they recognize too, kind of the
[02:24:10] difference between the, you know, the fast fashion, just buying like the cheap stuff, use it a few
[02:24:16] times and throw it away versus the conscious choice that I think a lot of people are starting to make
[02:24:21] is like, okay, I might pay a few more dollars, but I will take pride in knowing that in Origins case,
[02:24:29] from the cotton that's grown to the final hands that are putting those jeans in a bag,
[02:24:36] these were American hands that, and hard work and sweat that went into creating this. And I will
[02:24:42] wear this with pride. Yeah. And by the way, that hard work, these are people that have mortgages
[02:24:50] that are learning like we got kids, I shouldn't call them kids, but you know, people that are
[02:24:55] 23 years old, 22 years old, that now have a skill that they have a career now, whether it's running
[02:25:01] a loom, whether it's running a press, whatever skill they're getting, they're getting a skill that
[02:25:07] they can now have a, they have a real job, they have a career, they have a life. So that's what
[02:25:11] you're supporting. Also, environmentally, this is America. Exactly. We treat the environment well.
[02:25:17] Those factories that you're buying from overseas, especially from these companies that claim to be
[02:25:22] environmental companies and they're producing their stuff, why are they producing their stuff
[02:25:25] overseas? Because overseas, they don't have the regulations, they don't have the environmental
[02:25:28] regulations that we have to abide by, which we do gladly because we care about the environment,
[02:25:33] we care about the water, right? Exactly. We care about the nature, we care about animals,
[02:25:37] that's what we do. And so these big companies, they know that we're right and they are so horrified
[02:25:45] that the words getting out, the words getting out that we're here, we're doing it, they're horrified.
[02:25:50] If you want to help that out, originusa.com, get something that you're going to wear for the next
[02:25:56] 18 years. Exactly. You're going to wear a pair of jeans for 14 years. You're going to wear a pair
[02:26:01] of these boots forever. They might be forever. I mean, how long are you going to live? Maybe you
[02:26:06] live to be 100, right? But you're going to use a jiu-jitsu gi? Get one gi, get two gi's, you can
[02:26:12] use them forever. And by the way, our jiu-jitsu gi, you can wash it in a normal washing machine,
[02:26:16] it doesn't take nine hours to dry out. Like we're in a totally different world. Yeah. Plus it's
[02:26:21] Christmas coming up. Christmas is coming up. Christmas is coming up and the economy, we all
[02:26:27] know the economy needs help. Well, how do you help the economy? When you buy something from origin,
[02:26:32] you're helping the economy here in America. There's a worker that's getting paid, that's earning
[02:26:37] their career, that's paying their rent, paying their mortgage because of that. And then what do
[02:26:42] they do? They take that paycheck and they put it back into America. It's like, that's what we're
[02:26:44] doing. So originusa.com. Yep. Speaking of, speaking of Christmas, sometimes you want to get a shirt
[02:26:53] or something now. People representing, I'm telling you, you want a Discipline Eagles freedom shirt
[02:26:58] or Hatter Hoodie, whatever, go to chocolatestore.com. Yeah. Speaking of which, my youngest daughter
[02:27:05] is wrestling at this time. You know, it's wrestling season. We need some rash guards for her.
[02:27:09] You know, just, I got you. You do kind of make that happen. Yeah. Yeah. We got a few rash guards on
[02:27:14] there. She wants to represent. There you go. On the path. I'll get you a shirt too. All right.
[02:27:18] You don't have one already. Get you a tank top, something like that. Also, short locker. It's
[02:27:23] a subscription scenario where you get a shirt every month. Some good stuff coming out. No free
[02:27:27] dopamine. It's going to be a good one. That one kind of kind of get some traction on that.

[02:27:37] you sign up, you have access to all the past shirts. Like if you think all you missed out or
[02:27:40] something like that, you got access to that when you sign up. So whatever you need. Chocolatestore.com.
[02:27:45] You know, again, like back in the day when I was a kid, if you had some kind of crazy sort of
[02:27:50] movement in your life that you wanted to make a statement about, just get a t-shirt, bro.
[02:27:58] Put your statement on the t-shirt. Where discipline equals freedom t-shirt. There you go.
[02:28:02] In eight years, if you decide, you know what, I'm not really all about that discipline anymore.
[02:28:06] Cool. You get a different t-shirt. Let's get some donuts. Right? Let's stick with that.
[02:28:11] There's an anti-donut shirt coming out too, by the way. Shirt locker. Wow. That's controversial,
[02:28:16] man. That's highly controversial. Yeah, that was kind of hard to pull off, you know, because like,
[02:28:22] how do you, well, then again, there's a lot of ways to do it, but I think we got it.
[02:28:26] Donuts. Look, again, for me, and I get it, I get that there's two sides to every controversial
[02:28:33] thing in the world, but I just can't support donuts. I can't do it. I can't do it. So let me ask you
[02:28:40] this. Like, so like, every once in a great while, every once in a great while, like when I finished
[02:28:49] day zero of aerosol school in Hawaii, I was like, heck, I'm going to give me some donuts.
[02:28:55] I earned this shit. Once in a great while. Yeah, I get it. What's your once in a great while?
[02:29:03] I meant chocolate chip ice cream and straight, just chocolate chip cookies. All right. And, you know,
[02:29:11] by the way, if you're out there and you're going to send chocolate chip cookies or cookies to
[02:29:16] someone, just send them chocolate chip cookies. Don't send them peanut butter cookies. Definitely
[02:29:20] don't send them oatmeal raising cookies. No, no, no, that's the question. Because oatmeal raising
[02:29:24] cookies, look at first glance, I got chocolate chip cookies. What is the point? What is the point?
[02:29:32] So you might as well eat oatmeal, right? Come on. Come on. There are two kinds. There's two foods
[02:29:40] that I don't like oatmeal and cooked carrots. Just just those are just two things. I'm not
[02:29:48] really picky otherwise, but oatmeal and cooked carrots. I'm not happening. So Ryan Job,
[02:29:52] Taskin and Bruiser God, God bless him. He was killed or he's wounded. Iraq died of wounds. He
[02:30:02] hated cottage cheese. And so the smell of cottage cheese, he would start gagging. And there was a
[02:30:14] time he was getting, let's say, some counseling from his platoon and he was under a kangaroo court,
[02:30:23] right? And they're like, you know, Biggles, his nickname was Biggles. Biggles, you know, if you
[02:30:28] really love, I forget what it was, but it's something like, you know, if you really love the
[02:30:31] teams, you're going to eat this cottage cheese and like they're spooning it to his mouth. And as
[02:30:35] he's go, as it's going to his mouth, he's like, he's just choking it down and throwing up. It was
[02:30:41] freaking hysterical. So yeah, counseling. Yeah, he's getting some character building. You got to
[02:30:47] watch out that. But there's certain foods that do that to some people. Yeah. And apparently it's
[02:30:52] cooked carrots. Yeah, I just don't like them. The thing that I that has that effect, like that
[02:30:57] physical effect is actually just bananas. Like I will throw frozen bananas in my smoothies.
[02:31:04] Banana bread. Great. But I think it was because in basic training, like I, I mean, it was big,
[02:31:13] it was you will eat one banana with every meal. Because of what I would just prevent cramping,
[02:31:20] like, I don't know, whatever it was. And it just it literally got to a point where I was just like,
[02:31:25] like the gag reflex was so I to this day, I don't, I won't eat. That's crazy. Because the banana in
[02:31:31] the milkshake is that's the Tulsi jam or no, frozen frozen. Yeah, totally fine. Yeah, I won't
[02:31:37] actually owe you money on that. Like, yeah, we've been propping up the Tulsi frozen banana.
[02:31:44] It adds just that little bit of cream and I love it. I love it. But it's just like that's the fresh
[02:31:50] there was a I was on deployment. I was on a ship on deployment. There's no war going on. We're
[02:31:55] just trying to get jacked. And there was this, this protein shake that was vanilla. And I was
[02:32:02] drinking it like breakfast, lunch and dinner, trying to put on the game. And it was by the time,
[02:32:10] probably, probably two months into a six month deployment, I had to hold my nose and drink it
[02:32:17] like it was just shot at tequila, just like, oh, it made me want maybe we're thrown up and that
[02:32:22] kind of that kind of gave me like the kind of PTSD banana PTSD you're talking about. It's more the
[02:32:27] association. Yeah, even to this day, vanilla is not one of my favorites just because of that one
[02:32:34] six month period of choking down. You know, when you go on deployment and you have like a,
[02:32:39] like a palette and it's just filled with one flavor, you know, your screw. Totally. Especially
[02:32:44] because on a ship, like the food kind of sucks. If you're not getting good, you got to get your
[02:32:48] protein from somewhere. So there you go. But he, well, he can't technically back to the doughnuts
[02:32:52] thing. He can't advocate even for moderation. I painted myself into a corner with donuts. I
[02:32:58] painted myself into a corner with donuts, probably the one of the few things in the world, other
[02:33:02] than if you're ISIS, we're not going to get along. The other one is like, I can't really decide, hey,
[02:33:08] maybe donuts are okay on this occasion. Even when people have like protein donuts, you know,
[02:33:12] talking about like nutrition solutions, they make protein donuts. I'm sure they're good to go.
[02:33:16] And I'm sure they're, they're, they're like in compliance with the path. But I, I just can't
[02:33:23] do it because it's a moral victory for the doughnut. Yeah, you declared anti doughnut early on too.
[02:33:29] Yeah, I want hard. Yeah. So you cannot just like, like how you, and also, wait, is it my ego though?
[02:33:36] It's just my ego. It's part of the gig for sure. Or is it just, Hey, I'm going to just maintain the
[02:33:40] path here. Oh yeah. That's a good point. I don't know. It's like, but there's that other part too,
[02:33:44] though, just like the alcohol. You know how like, you're like, Hey, I can't advocate for alcohol
[02:33:48] at all. Well, even though we all know that, Hey, most people in moderation, then they're not going
[02:33:54] to have problems. But you start advocating for donuts, alcohol, whatever. Some people are like,
[02:33:58] Hey, chocolate, it's okay. Yeah, they start freaking pounding donuts every week. You know,
[02:34:02] can't do that. Can still, his moderation can be subjective. Exactly. I'll only eat five a week
[02:34:09] instead of today. I ate less today than I did yesterday. So whatever, you know, wait, you're
[02:34:13] vegan, right? Yeah. Now our donuts vegan. Some are. And there is a pop up in Hawaii
[02:34:20] that only opens up for four hours on the weekends and it's first come, first serve. And they usually
[02:34:27] sell out in the first hour vegan donuts. And they are, I will show you pictures afterward. They are
[02:34:33] the most heavenly, luxuriously like, Oh my gosh, you just look at it and it's like a whole meal in
[02:34:42] one donut. It's like, yeah, it's, it's a totally different situation. Where do you get your protein
[02:34:48] from? I take, I drink protein shakes every day. And it's primarily coming from a pea protein source.
[02:34:58] I used to do whey protein, but I long have you been a vegan for probably the last, I don't know,
[02:35:04] for five years, vegetarian my whole life. And then ethical reasons, environmental reasons,
[02:35:10] spiritual reasons, all of the above. Have you had a steak before? No. No, I feel like I want to take
[02:35:19] a dinner. That response is the response that I've gotten most often, especially in the military,
[02:35:23] but it's like, it's not, it's not something I've ever had. So it's like you saying that, I have no
[02:35:30] desire whatsoever. Rogan, I met Rogan for lunch or dinner, whatever one day with some of his friends.
[02:35:38] And they went to, what's the, what's the Brazilian folk of the child? And he didn't really comment
[02:35:47] it on the time, but he mentioned recently in a podcast, he's like, we went there and all she ate
[02:35:53] was salad. How is that even possible? But it's just, it's not something, you know, there's no,
[02:36:00] there's no craving, I guess. That's interesting. You guys just discussed, because you know,
[02:36:05] diet, hotteries, kids, I think exercise might be another one, religion and politics, those are the
[02:36:11] hot button subjects. So we're covering all of them today? Yeah, but this is the one you guys are
[02:36:15] opposed to. That's the thing. But I think, I think this is, this is like a good example though,
[02:36:20] because it's one thing to say, you know, like, Hey, this is my choice for my life and my lifestyle.
[02:36:29] I'm not trying to go around saying every single person in the world has to
[02:36:33] follow my exact life choices in all of those examples. If we hung out more, like if I moved back to
[02:36:39] Hawaii and, and we were hanging out more, would you kind of start to be like, Hey, you know,
[02:36:46] man, why are you eating all that steak? Do you think you would to try and help me?
[02:36:51] Not unless you were saying, Hey, Tulsi, I feel like shit and my body's not functioning. What would
[02:36:57] you advise or what's working for you? But otherwise no, that's kind of good. Because then that's
[02:37:02] what I was thinking too. As you were saying, I was thinking, if you said to me like, Hey,
[02:37:06] I don't feel that good. I feel lethargic. I'd be like, Hey, we're going out for steak.
[02:37:13] All right. What else? Echo Charles. So that's the short lockers. Yep. Stuff like this.
[02:37:19] Yep. Subscribe.
[02:37:21] Jocko Underground.com. This is a platform that we made in case we get kicked off of other platforms
[02:37:29] straight up. That's what's going on. That's the reality of what we face. And so if you go to
[02:37:33] jockounderground.com, you can get on that platform. It costs $8 and 18 cents a month.
[02:37:38] How'd you choose that number? By the way, I've always been curious.
[02:37:44] Is it an area code thing or? No, well, actually put it this way. There was the first reason,
[02:37:49] the primary reason. And then there's like a secondary reason that that shuffled like right in
[02:37:54] there as well. The secondary reason is from the Bible's like current sufferings don't outweigh
[02:37:59] future glory, something like this. And then, but the primary reason was hardcore recondos.
[02:38:06] Yeah. It's HR. It's eighth letter in the 18th, which we've, which we've never divulged until this
[02:38:11] moment. So that's what it is. The hardcore recondos out there. Both of those are pretty powerful
[02:38:17] meanings. And look, if you can't afford that, which I get it's tight times and they're going to get
[02:38:22] tighter, there's a recession. Am I allowed to say there's a recession coming? I think there are a
[02:38:27] lot of economists who would agree with you. If times get too tight and you can't afford it,
[02:38:32] just email email assistance at jockounderground.com. We'll get you hooked up there. You and check out
[02:38:39] Tulsi's sub sub stack. Yep. Where they just Google sub stack. Tulsi, if you go on sub stack and you
[02:38:44] just put in Tulsi or Tulsi Gabbard, it'll pop up there. Almost everything I put up is not behind
[02:38:51] a paywall. Um, if you want to kind of get in on the conversation, I think it's like six bucks a
[02:38:56] month or something. How'd you come up with that number? Six bucks a month? Ah, it's just the
[02:39:00] average of what's out there. I don't have a Bible verse to back it up. Clearly a missed opportunity.
[02:39:07] You know, I just giving you that opportunity. Then YouTube, we got the jocco podcast, YouTube
[02:39:12] channel and origin USA YouTube channel. And then the Tulsi Gabbard show, I think is your YouTube
[02:39:21] channel. Yeah. And subscribe to that. Everywhere you get your podcasts, um, these platforms are
[02:39:27] growing. They're new. And so for people, if you watch or you listen and you like it,
[02:39:32] subscribe, leave a rating and share it with others. That's the plan. Psychological warfare is out
[02:39:38] there. You need that. That jocco influence. Maybe I need some jocco discipline to make a new one of
[02:39:45] those. Yeah. It's been a while. I need to ask me some of those questions. What's good for the goose
[02:39:50] is good. Good for the other guy. Flipside, canvas.com, Dakota Myers company, bunch of books,
[02:39:56] a bunch of a written a bunch of books, only cry for the living by holiday day. Great, great
[02:40:03] Christmas gifts. Oh, I think people are looking. I mean, you know, it's just like, I, you know,
[02:40:09] when I think of gifts that I want to give people, they should be gifts of meaning and substance
[02:40:16] ideally rather than just something that is cheap and can be easily thrown away and become part
[02:40:21] of a landfill somewhere. That's what I think, you know, books are good. These books are, are
[02:40:26] fantastic. Some of the things you're talking about earlier because for me, I actually know,
[02:40:30] you can get audio books and, you know, e-books and all that, but I'm one of those people who,
[02:40:35] like if I'm taking notes and getting ready for a TV interview, I'll look at what's on the computer
[02:40:41] and then I actually sit there and actually write it down. There's something about reading words
[02:40:44] on the page that you can keep going back to. You can highlight, you can kind of bend the
[02:40:48] corner of the page over and know that that's something that you can use and keep going back
[02:40:54] to. Yeah, I am a huge physical books guy and there's definitely some sort of rote memorization
[02:41:04] that happens or absorption that happens when you write stuff down, you highlight it and all that
[02:41:07] stuff. So yeah, you can get all these books for Christmas for somebody and they can really help.
[02:41:14] I'll tell you what, honestly, just get the kids you know, get the kids you know, the Warrior
[02:41:18] Kid books. Yeah. Just to help them with life. It'll help them in so many different ways and
[02:41:23] there's so much, look, we spent the first, I don't know, 40 minutes today talking about all the
[02:41:27] negative influence that there is out there on kids and social media. Don't let them be exposed that
[02:41:33] or if they do get exposed to it, let them have some kind of a grounding and a foundation to think
[02:41:38] through what's going on and get on the right path as a human being. Way the Warrior Kid.
[02:41:42] One, two, three, four, five is coming by the way. Oh damn. Yeah. It's called Letters from Uncle Jake.
[02:41:48] So there you go. Ashland Front Leadership Consultancy. Go to Ashlandfront.com for details
[02:41:53] if you need help inside your organization, whatever organization that is. Let us know.
[02:41:57] We can help you. We have some live events. Orlando, April 3rd through the 5th and Dallas,
[02:42:04] October 18th through the 20th. We've sold out every one of these that we've ever done. So if you
[02:42:08] want to go, get in early. We have an online training, extremeownership.com. It's an online
[02:42:15] platform training in leadership. Leadership is not something you learn in the day. You can't just
[02:42:22] go to Tulsi's Army course on leadership and like, oh, now you're good to go. It's not going to
[02:42:27] happen. No offense to Tulsi, but it takes more than that. You're going to have, it's going to take
[02:42:31] time. So if you, it's like going to the gym, if you want to go to the gym for leadership,
[02:42:35] you want to go to the gym for life, go to extremeownership.com. If you want to help service
[02:42:39] members active and retire, active and retired, you want to help their families, Gold Star families,
[02:42:44] check out Mark Lee's mom, Mama Lee. She's got a charity organization.
[02:42:49] If you want to donate or you want to get involved, go to americasmightywarriors.org and also heroes
[02:42:53] and horses.org where Micah Fink has taken, taken people up into the wilderness so they can find
[02:43:01] themselves on horseback getting into the wilderness. So check that out as well. If you want to connect
[02:43:09] with Tulsi on the interwebs, TulsiGabbard.com on social media, on Twitter, on Instagram, on Facebook.
[02:43:17] She's at TulsiGabbard on YouTube at TulsiGabbard show and she's got her podcast and she's got
[02:43:23] her sub stack that we talked about. So check all that as well. And as far as Echo and I are
[02:43:29] concerned, Echo's at Echo Troll. So I am at Jocko Wink. But listen, the algorithm, just watch out
[02:43:36] for the algorithm because it is definitely looking to grab you and they're looking to brainwash you.
[02:43:42] And if you go into it knowing that they're looking to brainwash you, that's a good step in the right
[02:43:46] direction. Huge. But if you go into it thinking that you're getting smarter because of this,
[02:43:52] that's a bad situation that you're getting yourself into. So just please be careful.
[02:43:56] Be careful with this social media. Use it. Use it for something positive though.
[02:44:02] And only use it for a limited amount of time. All right, please. There you go. Tulsi, any closing
[02:44:08] thoughts for us? God, we covered a lot. It's great to see you guys. Great to be back.
[02:44:17] Yeah, I just to add on to what you just said, you know, don't underestimate the power of your own
[02:44:26] voice. Understand the responsibility that each of us has on the impact that we make in the world
[02:44:32] and know that the choices we make every day can lead to having a positive or negative impact.
[02:44:40] So be an independent thinker, be discerning and be intentional with the choices that you make
[02:44:46] both for yourself and for those around you. Sounds like a plan. Thanks for joining us again.
[02:44:53] Thank you. I'm sure we'll see you again. Thanks for your service in the army. Thanks for your service
[02:44:57] in Congress. Thanks for your service in America. And now I guess thank you for your service to
[02:45:02] the world as you try and help people by spreading Aloha worldwide. And thanks to all of our service
[02:45:13] members around the world in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. Thank you for protecting our
[02:45:18] freedom. The same goes here at home to our police and law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,
[02:45:22] EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all first responders.
[02:45:28] Thanks for what you do on a daily basis to keep us safe here at home. And everyone else out there,
[02:45:38] the world is a crazy place right now and it will drive you crazy if you let it.
[02:45:46] My recommendation is that you remain sane, that you stay balanced, that you don't let bots
[02:45:54] or provocateurs or trolls get into your head. Instead, listen but question what you hear,
[02:46:05] try and understand what's going on and then go do some Jiu-Jitsu.
[02:46:10] And then like Tulsi, go spread some of that Aloha spirit. And until next time, this is Tulsi and
[02:46:17] Echo and Jaco. Out.
