[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 346 with Dave Burke and me Jocko willing good evening Dave. Good evening
[00:00:08] In an airplane the guy was a mongoose
[00:00:14] It's hard to believe if the only bud Anderson you ever knew was the one on the ground calm
[00:00:20] Gentleman Lee a grandfather funny and all around nice guy
[00:00:25] But once you get him in an airplane, he's vicious shot down 17
[00:00:31] Best fighter pilot I've ever seen
[00:00:34] He's also the best friend I have in the world
[00:00:37] We go back 47 years Andy and I
[00:00:41] Andy and I developed a rapport flying mustangs in England particularly after I was shot down
[00:00:48] Made my way back and finally got the okay to finish my tour
[00:00:52] We were both small-town boys who liked hunting and fishing
[00:00:56] We kept finding things in common and developed a tremendous mutual respect
[00:01:02] By the time we finished up and went home
[00:01:05] We were pretty damn close although making friends wasn't something either of us went out of our way to do
[00:01:11] It was risky in wartime
[00:01:14] We lost an awful lot of guys over there
[00:01:17] We had the same kind of eyes
[00:01:19] 2010
[00:01:21] We saw everything that went on in the sky before anyone else in the squadron or even the group
[00:01:28] What made Andy unique was that he flew so many missions logged so many combat hours and never had a battle damage or a boarded mission
[00:01:38] An incredible record
[00:01:40] It shows what a meticulous professional he is especially in combat
[00:01:44] The same attention to detail is what made him a hell of a test pilot
[00:01:49] He had those eyes too and he developed the combat skills to take advantage of the opportunities his eyes brought him
[00:01:57] But luck was also a part of it
[00:02:00] Luck plays a big part in anything you do in combat
[00:02:03] Some guy you don't see can always sneak up and shoot your ass off
[00:02:08] No question Andy is a very very lucky guy
[00:02:12] Anyone who got through the war was
[00:02:15] Generally speaking getting killed was the least of our worries
[00:02:20] When it happens, you don't know anything about it anyway. So what the hell?
[00:02:24] That's the attitude. I think that most of us had
[00:02:28] Duty was paramount
[00:02:30] Damn it. It's your job
[00:02:32] The fact that you might get killed doesn't enter your mind after the first couple times
[00:02:37] And so those right there are words
[00:02:41] Written by Chuck Yeager
[00:02:44] Probably the most famous and legendary fighter pilot of all time
[00:02:49] And the words are written in the forward of a book called to fight to fly and fight
[00:02:55] by Colonel Clarence Bud Anderson who Chuck Yeager refers to as Andy
[00:03:01] Now by the way, I'm not sure if you've heard of it
[00:03:04] Chuck Yeager refers to as Andy now Bud Anderson was a fighter pilot pilot in World War two
[00:03:11] And in Vietnam he was a triple ace
[00:03:15] Which means he shot down more than 15 enemy aircraft
[00:03:20] He was a test pilot when being a test pilot meant you were the best of the best
[00:03:27] He ended up serving over 30 years in uniform
[00:03:29] And it is an honor to have him with us here tonight to discuss his experiences and lessons learned
[00:03:38] Sir, thank you so much for joining us. It's an honor to have you here
[00:03:42] Was my pleasure, Joe. That's quite the praise from General Yeager. You got there
[00:03:50] He wrote it
[00:03:52] So I guess we can jump into this I know I know you were born January 13th 1922 and
[00:04:04] Right now the date is
[00:04:06] August 3rd 2022
[00:04:09] Which means you got the you got the triple digits in your age up there at a hundred
[00:04:16] That's pretty impressive. What's the keys to your health?
[00:04:19] No minor vices
[00:04:21] There you go
[00:04:23] That'll do it
[00:04:25] You got some kind of just to get to know you a little bit
[00:04:29] I want to read a little section from the book here and
[00:04:33] It says I was the third of my father's four children born January 13th 1922 in Oakland where my mom's parents lived Friday the 13th
[00:04:42] It was if it's an unlucky day, you couldn't prove it by me. I've been pretty lucky. I never was superstitious
[00:04:49] It says Clarence a meal. Is that right a meal Anderson, Jr. On my birth certificate
[00:04:57] But few call me Clarence or junior and none call me a meal
[00:05:01] When I was young my family nicknamed me buddy, which in time became bud
[00:05:06] The men I flew with used Andy because all Anderson's are automatically Andy. I
[00:05:13] Can attest to that
[00:05:15] The first thing I remember is Lindbergh making it across the Atlantic when he when I was just five
[00:05:21] I have no idea why somebody flying from one place to another should have made such a lasting impression
[00:05:26] But it kindled an interest in airplanes that would last a lifetime
[00:05:30] When I was seven my father took me to Sacramento to a little dirt airfield with one little hangar where a fellow named
[00:05:37] Ingvald Fager Scott
[00:05:39] Made or supplemented his living by taking people up for rides in a Steerman biplane
[00:05:45] The airfield was an Auburn Boulevard near Watt Avenue
[00:05:49] I can remember being excited and a little bit frightened the incredible
[00:05:54] intoxicating smell of the gasoline oil and airplane dope like a new car smell and the throaty sound of the engine
[00:06:01] most of all I remember flying over our house and
[00:06:04] Circling tightly the pilot standing the plane on its side. It's a pretty awesome introduction to aviation
[00:06:15] The the biplane was the first thing you flew in huh? Yes, and so that's just a big giant open cockpit
[00:06:23] Was your dad with you or is only a two seat? Yeah, it was a three-seater
[00:06:27] Okay, you know the pilot in the back and then side by side seats
[00:06:32] Hmm. Okay in the front
[00:06:34] And he buzzed your house. Yeah
[00:06:37] So you could say your dad is partially to blame for your fascination with flying he supported my
[00:06:44] my
[00:06:47] Likes mm-hmm. So what did you what did your mom and dad do when you were growing up?
[00:06:53] Well, I grew up on a farm and that's what we did we farmed
[00:06:58] And that means you were probably working more than most people work in their lives. Yeah, I had
[00:07:06] Yeah pretty heavy
[00:07:08] chores and
[00:07:10] Then later on is a depression
[00:07:16] Hip
[00:07:18] My mom had to go
[00:07:20] Go to go back to work
[00:07:23] And she went and found a job in
[00:07:27] the
[00:07:28] governor's office and
[00:07:30] She was just a typist and everything and then worked her way up to office manager
[00:07:37] And then it was it was in that oldies a spoiled system
[00:07:42] So when a new governor came in they fired everybody
[00:07:46] and then
[00:07:48] they kept her to
[00:07:50] You know tie in got it and then pretty soon they they
[00:07:58] Dropped her salary and everything
[00:08:01] but suddenly soon they
[00:08:05] Said why don't you stay brought her salary back up and then she's went through about four governors like that
[00:08:15] Pretty pretty awesome. Yeah, I mean
[00:08:18] It
[00:08:19] Wait for the depression and being in a farmer during the depression. Yeah, how rough was that for for the family?
[00:08:29] Well at least we we didn't suffer too bad from food because we manufactured food, right?
[00:08:39] We raised chicken was an
[00:08:41] Um, good lots of vegetables and fruit of course
[00:08:48] so a lot of canning and
[00:08:53] So as a kid, I don't remember being hungry at any time. Wow
[00:08:58] Well, that's a definitely a good family business to have during the depression being a farmer
[00:09:04] And so but you still had to go to school, right? Oh, yeah, and I know you played you played sports in school. I
[00:09:12] was I
[00:09:13] Like the basketball, but I was kind of small so I could only play on the sea and the
[00:09:20] meetings I
[00:09:23] Could never go to the varsity
[00:09:25] But it sounds like you know in the book you talk about sounds like your dad not only encourage you with flying but he put a lot of
[00:09:35] He put a lot of
[00:09:37] It seemed like he put a lot of trust in you even as a young kid a lot of responsibility
[00:09:40] I know you and you know, I get asked a lot of questions about parenting and at one point you crashed your car
[00:09:47] How that happened oh
[00:09:55] Young and
[00:09:57] Young and scared hit the wrong pedal. Yeah. Well, yeah, well
[00:10:04] As you came up
[00:10:06] You can't see that here, but there's a double road at the front door
[00:10:12] and it always went on the inner inner road, you know and
[00:10:19] So I came around the corner
[00:10:22] He's an he's behind the wheel and I'm over here
[00:10:27] Steering and you know with the foot pedal too
[00:10:31] and so I come up to
[00:10:34] Go down the road and oh it's blocked by a car
[00:10:37] So I said oh I gotta gotta get over here in the left and get on my bypass and
[00:10:46] and a big
[00:10:48] Tree was coming up and I went to the middle and pushed down on accelerator and ducked my head under the
[00:10:57] dash I think and dad was
[00:11:00] It he was trying to get me to get out of there, you know, but I was I don't know
[00:11:08] It's just a bad bad thing
[00:11:11] But the interesting thing is how he kind of handled that, you know
[00:11:14] He kind of got you right back on the horse as they say. Oh, yeah, you know, how if you go through a
[00:11:22] Terrifying experience
[00:11:24] It's best to get them back on back online
[00:11:31] Now speaking of terrifying experiences for someone that has aspirations of being a pilot
[00:11:36] I know there was a plane crash that took place in your hometown
[00:11:41] How did that impact you and how did that steer you away from wanting to be a pilot?
[00:11:46] well, I had a buddy down there in Lumas nearby town and
[00:11:51] He and I were just kind of nuts about anything aviation is this Jack. Yeah, Jack Sacker and
[00:12:02] so
[00:12:05] This was something we had to investigate personally
[00:12:09] And it was an old Boeing
[00:12:12] Byplane three engine by plane
[00:12:15] He crashed in the
[00:12:17] On the side of a hill not too heavy
[00:12:23] Dan well, you know was the whole fuselage was there and the other parts of it got in order in the area
[00:12:33] and
[00:12:35] So we just had to we just had to see what it was like
[00:12:40] Yeah, and I guess in those days, there's no black box. There's no real way to tell what had even gone wrong
[00:12:46] No
[00:12:47] But you looked at that and said
[00:12:50] Still seems like a good
[00:12:52] Seems like a good job. I want well, maybe we want to fly fighters
[00:13:02] So I'm gonna fat and by the way, I'm gonna read some chunks of the book the book is fantastic
[00:13:09] Get just order the book right now. It's just an incredible book with so many details in it
[00:13:13] I'm gonna fast forward a little bit. You say right after graduation
[00:13:17] I was working out in the yard when a car came chattering into the drive a fellow climbed out
[00:13:23] Extended his hand showed me his teeth and started telling me in a practice salesman's pitch
[00:13:28] About this trade school and down down in Los Angeles or someplace
[00:13:32] He said they could teach me all about refrigeration a good solid career and he pulled a bunch of brochures from his bag
[00:13:38] I'm thinking how college would have been nice, but I've got to do something and then dad came around the corner
[00:13:44] We hadn't talked much about the future
[00:13:47] We talked more about Arthur J. Lewis the several months previous than we'd ever talked about my future
[00:13:52] But there and then in the yard. I learned that my dad was pretty shrewd and supportive
[00:13:57] Go on get out of here. He told the salesman gruffly my boy is going to college and then he's going into the Army Air Corps
[00:14:06] so he
[00:14:08] He was convinced that this is what you were going to do. Yeah, and he was fully supportive. I think was the other way around
[00:14:20] Fast forward a little bit you say there were three requirements for enlisting in the Army Air Corps beyond passing the physical
[00:14:26] You needed two years of college. I figured to complete the course in June 1941
[00:14:31] You had to be at least 20 years old
[00:14:33] Which I would be on January 13th, 1942 and you had to be single
[00:14:39] Which seems simple enough since I had no good prospects
[00:14:43] This course of study would qualify me and if it turned out I couldn't fly for some reason then at least I could fix or build airplanes
[00:14:53] So that's what you're thinking. You're focused on getting into the Army Air Corps. There's some
[00:14:58] Pretty minimal requirements really to go and enlist. I
[00:15:02] Mean not being married sounds like you were trying the field but hadn't turned anything out yet
[00:15:09] So you were all right there. Well, you're physical with something you you know your eyes
[00:15:19] Did you know when they gave you the physical that your eyes were awesome I
[00:15:26] Can't remember I think maybe
[00:15:28] We did go get a air dock to give me a flight physical. I don't really I
[00:15:37] Don't really remember
[00:15:39] You end up
[00:15:41] Taking flying lessons so you're learning how to fly
[00:15:45] And you say this my instructor Dale Hunter was an old guy
[00:15:49] 24 maybe I don't remember that learning was terribly difficult on the daily rating sheets
[00:15:55] There were 36 descriptive words or phrases some positive some otherwise
[00:16:00] All or none of which the instructor could check after each lesson
[00:16:04] The four he marked after my first flight March 4th 1941 war
[00:16:10] cooperative rough on controls careful poor coordination on
[00:16:16] March 27th the day that I soloed he put a mark by erratic by the end of May
[00:16:22] After 37 hours in the cub he would check only eager to learn and consistent
[00:16:29] I don't remember a lot of compliments, but I soloed after the standard eight hours of instruction
[00:16:33] Did everything pretty much by the numbers got my license no problem
[00:16:37] So there you go. You're learning how to fly pretty pretty quick. It seems like yeah, I was
[00:16:45] What I guess
[00:16:47] 17 or 18 yeah, it
[00:16:54] Was a government program
[00:16:58] Civilian pilot training program and
[00:17:02] With no commitment no
[00:17:05] Finance, oh, I think it was a
[00:17:08] insurance policy for my parents and $9.50
[00:17:15] and
[00:17:16] It was a pretty good deal. So I globed on to it while I was going to
[00:17:22] Junior college so so what year was that that you soloed for the first time?
[00:17:27] 41 so that was 1941. Yeah, so spring
[00:17:32] So when did so when did Pearl Harbor happen? So it happened December 7th. Yeah, so you were already flying
[00:17:38] But you weren't old enough to enlist yet, correct
[00:17:41] and
[00:17:44] We were I went to work
[00:17:49] Like my college training
[00:17:52] Qualified me to be an aircraft mechanic. It was a technical school part of a two-year thing and
[00:18:02] The Sacramento Air Depot was building up as a depot and
[00:18:08] And they were hiring anybody that said they could turn a wrench. I think
[00:18:14] They hired our whole class
[00:18:17] man
[00:18:19] This was after Pearl Harbor. They hired your whole class
[00:18:22] Right at graduation. Oh graduation graduation six months before got it pile Harbor
[00:18:29] And I can remember to this day
[00:18:31] well every guy if we're a war two guy knows where he was December 7th and
[00:18:39] We were working 24-7 and
[00:18:42] Being the kids young guys they put us on the graveyard shift
[00:18:48] and I just got none days and
[00:18:54] And I remember Sunday
[00:18:56] I came around later in the day and
[00:19:02] Said hey you you you
[00:19:05] Go home and come back at midnight. Jeff's just attacked us at Pearl Harbor
[00:19:10] God, I didn't even know where Pearl Harbor was
[00:19:14] But I knew the impact of that was
[00:19:18] Oh, we're at war and
[00:19:22] I was still
[00:19:24] 19
[00:19:27] And
[00:19:28] So I had to wait one month. I
[00:19:31] Went down on my birthday and a few days later. I
[00:19:36] Raised my right hand and I was on my way
[00:19:42] You say in the book on the 13th of January my 20th birthday I went in to sign up
[00:19:47] They had a recruiting office right there on base
[00:19:50] They gave me a physical and I was so keyed up with anticipation that they gave me the
[00:19:54] Schneider test a blood pressure and pulse check the doctor said I was borderline there might be a problem
[00:19:59] My heart was pounding away like a jackhammer. I was told to come back in a couple days
[00:20:03] They test me again after I was accepted
[00:20:05] I couldn't wait to tell Lloyd
[00:20:08] Geraldson an older guy who'd been a pilot and done some barnstorming
[00:20:12] He worked at the depot and we often carpool together
[00:20:15] I looked up to him like to listen to him talk about flying. I told him the moment he got in the car and
[00:20:23] He leaned back against the passengers door and stared at me silently
[00:20:28] Son he said after a while. Let me tell you something. You've just signed your own death warrant
[00:20:33] That's a heavy statement. Yeah years later
[00:20:48] We talked about it years later and he said he doesn't remember saying that
[00:20:55] He was just throwing it out there it had a little impact on me, but not much
[00:21:01] Hmm
[00:21:03] So then you start flight training. Yeah, and it was all the flight training down in San Diego
[00:21:08] Just my primary. Okay, so you go down there and from the book it sounds like you you already knew how to fly
[00:21:15] So got a private pilots license. Did that make it just a lot easier than the other people were having I?
[00:21:23] Don't remember having any trouble
[00:21:26] Going through the military
[00:21:28] I
[00:21:30] I
[00:21:32] I
[00:21:34] I
[00:21:36] I
[00:21:38] I
[00:21:40] I
[00:21:42] I
[00:21:44] I
[00:21:46] I
[00:21:48] I
[00:21:50] I
[00:21:52] I
[00:21:54] I
[00:21:56] I
[00:21:58] I
[00:22:00] I
[00:22:02] I
[00:22:04] I
[00:22:06] I
[00:22:08] I
[00:22:10] I
[00:22:12] I
[00:22:14] I
[00:22:16] I
[00:22:18] I
[00:22:20] I
[00:22:22] I
[00:22:24] I don't think there was too much
[00:22:26] of that
[00:22:28] Tell you the truth
[00:22:30] It probably just pilot maybe yeah
[00:22:34] So you guys were busy creating the aura that guys like Dave Burke would get to live off of
[00:22:42] So you get your wings do you get your wings at the end of primary?
[00:22:46] No, you got to go through three flight schools
[00:22:49] Primary basic and advanced about three months along
[00:22:55] And do you know that you're going to be a fighter pilot? I mean because you could be a transport pilot
[00:23:01] How do you how do they figure out who's going to get to be a fighter pilot especially?
[00:23:05] At that time when I went in
[00:23:08] if you
[00:23:11] Knew what you wanted to do
[00:23:14] And I could convince your instructor
[00:23:17] That you'd be a good fighter pilot
[00:23:20] Your chances were pretty good of getting what you wanted
[00:23:24] We needed they were trying to build up
[00:23:29] From
[00:23:32] You know a few few
[00:23:35] Hundreds of pilots
[00:23:38] To 225,000 pilots
[00:23:42] And don't let safety get in the way of progress
[00:23:45] progress
[00:23:47] And I'd like to I don't think this is in my book, but uh a sad
[00:23:56] Statistic of world war two is
[00:23:59] We killed more of our own pilots in training
[00:24:04] Than we did in combat
[00:24:06] Wow
[00:24:09] Wow
[00:24:10] That's uh, that's definitely a crazy statistic especially
[00:24:14] Like the new generation like Dave the safety was number one
[00:24:18] 100% right
[00:24:20] Yeah, I mean safety is a huge thing
[00:24:23] You did say something I wanted to ask about though
[00:24:26] Didn't everybody want to be a fighter pilot or are there guys that actually wanted to fly other airplanes?
[00:24:32] I think there was
[00:24:35] An equal number of wanted to fly multi engine
[00:24:39] Gotcha
[00:24:41] Um, and I don't know where my fighter pilot thing came from actually
[00:24:47] I think it was watching the
[00:24:52] Battle of britain newsreels
[00:24:56] You know wow and
[00:25:01] Then I thought you know
[00:25:05] If I'm a fighter pilot in a single place
[00:25:08] fighter
[00:25:10] I'm responsible for keeping me alive
[00:25:14] And I'd be the pilot the navigator the radio man the gunner
[00:25:18] the
[00:25:19] bomber bombardier all of those things
[00:25:23] And then I would not have to depend on 10 more
[00:25:27] 10
[00:25:29] crews of 10
[00:25:32] And besides that I thought the fighters were a little bit cooler
[00:25:35] Well, I mean you want to talk about the building the aura of pilots
[00:25:40] I mean the battle of britain if you're watching that thing happen and you're seeing those spitfires and the
[00:25:46] Spitfires going out there and doing their work that had to at least start the momentum going for fighter pilots becoming what we now know as fighter pilots
[00:25:59] So once you do get trained you go you get sent to uh,
[00:26:02] San Francisco and you start flying a p39 for the 328th fighter group
[00:26:09] Correct, and you're flying coastal defense
[00:26:14] Well, I think that's just because we were there
[00:26:18] And we were flying military airplanes and they we didn't have any coastal defense
[00:26:24] And so you know you grabbed what you had and said okay you were part of it
[00:26:29] Yeah, it sounds like a job that
[00:26:34] Sounds like a job they kind of need something for you to do
[00:26:38] And they're not sure what although Dave you threw you flew combat air patrols over
[00:26:43] LA after september 11th, right? May our squadron right at right at starting on 9 11. We had a
[00:26:48] Mission starting that morning where we were flying missions up and down the coast
[00:26:53] Yeah, so that's uh kind of similar right
[00:26:56] I imagine it came from from not knowing what was going to happen next
[00:26:59] You know we had none of a clue. Yeah, and we we uh stayed up all night one time
[00:27:06] Because there was a report of a
[00:27:09] Japanese fleet
[00:27:11] You know coming toward the coast
[00:27:14] And it was it was ours
[00:27:18] They didn't tell anybody
[00:27:21] Well, that's not a good side
[00:27:23] You ended up losing your wingman
[00:27:25] In that time frame
[00:27:27] Is that right? Oh
[00:27:30] Yeah, I had a wingman. We were doing a
[00:27:34] You know he was a brand new and so he was just getting checked out
[00:27:41] And I
[00:27:42] Had him on my wing and I'm flying on here come a couple of navy planes
[00:27:47] And that wasn't uncommon. You know we had a lot of navy there in the Bay Area too
[00:27:55] And so it wasn't unusual that we would
[00:28:02] Attack each other and
[00:28:05] Have a little dog fight
[00:28:07] and the two navy planes came by and came across this and
[00:28:14] and
[00:28:16] I started heading down
[00:28:18] towards towards us
[00:28:21] and
[00:28:23] I was wagging my wings like
[00:28:25] Hey, wait a minute. Don't bother me now
[00:28:29] But that may have maybe waving my wings, but hey
[00:28:34] Let's have a dog fight. You know who knows
[00:28:38] and so
[00:28:40] I made a
[00:28:42] Pretty steep turn into them
[00:28:44] And my my new wingman just just maybe his second ride in the fighter
[00:28:53] Got in here and stalled the thing
[00:28:56] And I watched him
[00:28:58] Go into the bay
[00:29:03] Yeah, um
[00:29:04] Reflecting on that in the book you say
[00:29:08] Dying was easy a piece of cake lots of people would die
[00:29:12] And I and so I suppose I began putting up walls
[00:29:17] I knew I had to concentrate on what I was doing and block out the rest
[00:29:22] Jager wrote about that in his book how he stayed away from people didn't want to get close
[00:29:28] I don't know that I consciously carried it to that extreme, but it came out the same
[00:29:33] If you fly airplanes drive race cars do stunts for movies or maybe walk a high wire with the flying willendas
[00:29:40] Anything truly hazardous
[00:29:43] Then losing friends goes with the territory
[00:29:46] We're talking serious stress here and you either cope or you don't
[00:29:50] Death is a thing that you have to get used to as cruel and hard as it sounds
[00:29:56] From that point on from that point on I resolved to control my emotions no matter how hard that might be
[00:30:06] And you got some other
[00:30:08] Um
[00:30:10] Some other things that you talk about
[00:30:13] Just about being a good fighter pilot
[00:30:15] Uh, you because you're you know, you're mentioning that you got to control your emotions
[00:30:18] You also say a fighter pilot mentality was taking firm route now living close to the edge
[00:30:24] Sort of went with the job
[00:30:26] Daring audacity creativity flare
[00:30:29] These things were as much a part of being a
[00:30:31] Good fighter pilots makeup as skill and sound judgment and were encouraged within certain parameters
[00:30:39] Sometimes of course we stretch those a little the rest of the time more than a little
[00:30:46] You measured a pilot by his formation flying as much as by dog fighting
[00:30:49] Some guys would weave in and out just couldn't hold it there and some the talented ones could stick to your wing like paint
[00:30:56] You'd bank and go down and the good ones would stay right there no closer no farther away
[00:31:02] This was wartime however, and there was the other kind too
[00:31:06] We needed pilots so there was reluctance to wash people out and even more so once they'd gotten their wings
[00:31:12] marginal pilots slipped through not many and almost no truly bad ones at least not in fighters
[00:31:20] But there were pilots that made you uncomfortable wingtip to wingtip
[00:31:24] Chuck Jaeger was in the first group of pilots that joined us at tonapah
[00:31:30] We had only six months more experience than the guys straight out of flying school
[00:31:34] But that was a lot we knew how to fly p 39s the new guys hadn't seen one
[00:31:39] Some found the transition tricky at first but not Jaeger
[00:31:42] Chuck became the first the yardstick by which we would measure the rest as they joined us several each month
[00:31:49] Jaeger could fly right from the start. He was pretty impressive
[00:31:52] Jaeger and Chuck McGee had been flying sergeants graduates of a program for non commissioned officers
[00:31:58] Then someone decided pilots had to be officers. So they made up a rank flight officer
[00:32:04] equivalent to a warren officer one grade below second lieutenant
[00:32:07] So these guys were unusual what we called blue bars after the color of their insignia
[00:32:13] The two lowest ranking pilots in the squadron
[00:32:16] He was from West Virginia and had a terrible draw
[00:32:19] Over the years I got the impression that he loved to use it
[00:32:22] Never tried to hide it practiced it for all I knew
[00:32:26] He had such a distinctive voice you had no trouble picking him out on the radio
[00:32:29] And he had those eyes hunter's eyes
[00:32:32] Most of the aces could pick up far off airplanes a little quicker than the rest of the men
[00:32:37] But as often as not it was Jaeger spotting the enemy first and announcing it over the radio
[00:32:42] Making it sound like the Grand Old Opry
[00:32:45] When it wasn't him calling them out it was usually me
[00:32:51] So that's a big deal to have the eagle eyes that you guys had
[00:32:55] Yeah it really was when you think about it we didn't have any kind of a
[00:33:04] Ground control you know toward you know many bandits at 12 o'clock
[00:33:09] You had to see him
[00:33:16] It was an incredibly important in combat
[00:33:21] Dave you got good eyes don't you?
[00:33:23] I was uh I was given the gift of of really good vision and so
[00:33:27] But it's not as important now no because you just get basically in a modern
[00:33:31] You just got to be able to see the screens in front of your face, right?
[00:33:35] Thanks
[00:33:36] It's
[00:33:37] I would not draw a comparison of what what Colonel Anderson
[00:33:41] Needed in terms of the vision but having good eyesight even today
[00:33:45] Is a huge advantage because at some point all the computers all the information
[00:33:51] You were talking about even someone on the ground telling you where to go and where to look
[00:33:54] Eventually you have to see him yourself
[00:33:57] And the sooner you see him the better and the better your eyes are the sooner you see him. So
[00:34:03] For me
[00:34:04] 50 years later to me
[00:34:06] 50 years later listened you describe a fighter pilot daring creative stretching limits
[00:34:14] It's the exact same way we think about it 50 years later
[00:34:17] So your explanation is is timeless for what a good fighter pilot makes so it was really cool to read that and hear that from you
[00:34:25] Now you get trained up and eventually you get orders to europe
[00:34:29] You get orders to europe and again to fast forward a little bit through the story here
[00:34:33] And people got to get the book to get the all the details
[00:34:36] But you guys ride over
[00:34:38] To england on on the queen elizabeth
[00:34:41] right
[00:34:42] So but I it's not exactly the luxury liner that you wanted it to be right
[00:34:47] They'd pack you in there with what 17 000 guys
[00:34:51] Yeah, it was something like that
[00:34:54] A division
[00:34:56] infantry division
[00:34:58] Plus the fighter group and yeah, I did something like that. Yeah, it's a big number
[00:35:05] The air conditioning I assume wasn't great on that on that ride over. Well, it was for our gis
[00:35:12] They had to ride
[00:35:14] 24 hours on that open deck. They had plenty of air conditioning
[00:35:20] and then 25
[00:35:22] 24 hours in the hole
[00:35:25] Yeah, but I was a captain
[00:35:27] So I got a honeymoon suite on the
[00:35:32] Fourth floor nice with 17 other guys
[00:35:39] Uh, and you had to be were you thinking all about like you boats like getting oh my gosh, yeah
[00:35:46] We had not won the battle before the Atlantic yet
[00:35:50] and we were taking
[00:35:53] Pretty good losses
[00:35:55] Yeah, and I figured that the queen mary and the queen elizabeth had to be primary targets
[00:36:02] You know that there was to be a ring of them out there off of new york
[00:36:08] And which we'd have to go through
[00:36:11] But you know, they did that the whole war and
[00:36:16] ours, I'm no were never damaged or anything
[00:36:21] They were fast
[00:36:23] And
[00:36:25] They'd change course, you know every so often
[00:36:32] They would take alternative routes instead of going directly across
[00:36:37] I remember we went down by the azores on our trip to the anglin
[00:36:44] and so
[00:36:47] Yeah thinking thinking
[00:36:49] About you boats was was very high on my list
[00:36:56] Yeah, that's gotta be scary
[00:36:58] And you know, they didn't have enough lifeboats for 10 or 15,000 people on that
[00:37:03] Oh my god, I don't know whether they did or not, but we had lifeboat drills all the time
[00:37:09] Wow
[00:37:11] Uh, you end up arriving in england
[00:37:15] December 4th 1943
[00:37:18] And
[00:37:20] I'm gonna get into a little section here
[00:37:24] You say I don't remember when or how I learned about jack
[00:37:29] He'd been shot down over germany on november 13th and was listed as missing
[00:37:34] But I don't remember how I found out
[00:37:37] It seems clear I had a note from my sister, but I have no memory of it
[00:37:41] I don't recall what my emotions were
[00:37:44] Though in thinking this book through I've tried
[00:37:46] I'm certain I wrote a letter about it to elinor saying how terribly sorry I was
[00:37:52] But I have no memory of what the letter contained exactly
[00:37:57] And and elinor was was jack's wife
[00:38:00] Like most men who've known combat
[00:38:02] I can remember the finest detail the nuances what airplanes look like in my gun sights what I felt in the swirl of battle
[00:38:09] What I said to people and what they said to me on certain days 40 odd years ago
[00:38:14] I can remember silly things the words to some glenn miller tunes the first points I ever scored in a basketball game
[00:38:22] These things are burned into me. I can summon them up in an instant
[00:38:27] But as for things in my heart on the day I found out my best friend had been shot down and possibly killed
[00:38:33] No clue remains
[00:38:35] All of that is blocked out
[00:38:38] The screen is blank
[00:38:40] Before anyone thought up computers or knew what delete buttons were I had one and I punched it
[00:38:47] That was how we all managed
[00:38:50] On December 12th, I wrote my parents. I received june's letter
[00:38:55] Although it had been bad news about jack. It still was swell to get my first mail here
[00:39:00] I can imagine how you can imagine how I feel about it
[00:39:05] But as long as he is just reported missing
[00:39:07] I won't worry about him
[00:39:11] Much later we would learn he'd survived the bailout from his p-38, but it died in hospital
[00:39:18] Jack stacker is buried in belgium in one of those sprawling white on green military cemeteries
[00:39:24] That we americans maintain so meticulously the cross is all in row
[00:39:30] He was married two weeks before he went off to war and then never came home
[00:39:34] Like 291,130 other american boys in that war
[00:39:41] It was just his fourth mission
[00:39:49] So this I mean this is jack the boy that you grew up with the boy that you were obsessed with airplanes with
[00:39:55] The kid that you both wanted to go and fly
[00:39:58] And here you are basically almost as soon as you arrive in england you find out that
[00:40:05] That he's been shot down
[00:40:08] Yeah, yes
[00:40:16] I don't know what else I can say other than what you just read
[00:40:19] Um, it was a blow to me
[00:40:27] But then it
[00:40:30] We knew he was in the hospital we learned that
[00:40:34] And so he had to been alive
[00:40:38] So there was some hope, you know, you know, drag along and on and on and then you find out he's killed
[00:40:44] it's uh
[00:40:47] Maybe a easy way to break him on it, but it's still a blow no matter how you slice it
[00:40:57] Meanwhile you guys get issued the first
[00:41:02] P-51s that are going to enter the war
[00:41:06] And
[00:41:08] Tell me about that p-51 the first time you got to fire that thing up
[00:41:12] Well, I'm going to go back further than that when we got the word
[00:41:19] I don't think any of us had even seen a Mustang let alone fly one
[00:41:27] And then after we got to fly or fly him
[00:41:31] Uh
[00:41:33] It was kind of a
[00:41:35] Do-it-yourself checkout
[00:41:37] Uh
[00:41:39] We would send a guy up to the port where they were assembled
[00:41:45] Find a crew chief
[00:41:47] Learn how to start it
[00:41:50] And bring it back and check out the next guy
[00:41:54] And uh
[00:41:57] I can hear again. I'm I'm one of these lucky guys
[00:42:02] About this time a group commander came by and says hey, but we're gonna
[00:42:07] Uh
[00:42:09] They call me Andy actually
[00:42:14] You're gonna go to the
[00:42:17] Royal Air Force central
[00:42:19] flight instructor school gunnery instructor
[00:42:25] And uh
[00:42:26] Take a p-51 and fly the course with a p-51 instead of
[00:42:34] a spitfire
[00:42:35] Which is what the course
[00:42:38] was taught in
[00:42:41] So that gave me 35 hours in the Mustang before combat
[00:42:46] Where other guys were lucky to get
[00:42:50] Uh two or three flights
[00:42:54] Uh
[00:42:56] I make that sound
[00:42:59] You know really bad but
[00:43:01] It was so much better than the p-39 and we knew it and boy we weren't gonna bitch
[00:43:12] But the bad thing about it was the handbooks didn't even come with the airplane
[00:43:19] And so we're we're making it up
[00:43:23] And
[00:43:25] And it didn't have to be that way because the pioneer Mustang group was already in
[00:43:30] The theater checked out
[00:43:34] But they just didn't have a way of passing the word to you guys well, I don't know why though
[00:43:43] Dave what do you want to know about the p-51 Mustang?
[00:43:46] I'm trying to imagine that feeling of of and I think you described it
[00:43:50] They didn't quote tell you where you were gonna go, but you knew where you were going
[00:43:54] Oh, yeah, but you left your p-39s behind
[00:43:57] Yes, so did you know did you have a thought that they were going to be p-51s there or was that a surprise when you found out?
[00:44:04] well
[00:44:07] When when I
[00:44:11] Looking back at it
[00:44:19] We wondered where we would go, you know with p-39s
[00:44:23] And
[00:44:26] be in North Africa or
[00:44:29] South Pacific where they were
[00:44:33] being used
[00:44:36] And so
[00:44:39] We heard at the same time we're going to go to England and we're getting the brand new p-51 Bravo
[00:44:48] So that one was a surprise but
[00:44:51] When we got there
[00:44:54] Not having airplanes there waiting for us was a little bit of a surprise
[00:45:01] And so then that's when we learned that oh, we're gonna go to the port and bring bring your own airplane home
[00:45:09] Oh, Jesus
[00:45:11] Uh, and we thought we thought once we flew the airplane
[00:45:19] Boy, we didn't bitch about a thing
[00:45:23] It was so much better than the p-39
[00:45:28] You know, we didn't want to get bitch bitch too much said okay guys you can go to african
[00:45:34] fly your old p-39
[00:45:37] We love that Mustang
[00:45:39] Ah, it was it was a great airplane and it was
[00:45:46] It it
[00:45:49] It was a perfect airplane for the european theater
[00:45:53] It had such long range and endurance
[00:45:57] highly maneuverable
[00:46:00] and
[00:46:02] Just no negative things people said oh well it was liquid cool and one bullet hole in there would
[00:46:10] ruin your whole day. Well, we didn't have many of those believe it or not
[00:46:16] and so even that didn't
[00:46:19] turn out to be a
[00:46:21] You know a big negative factor
[00:46:25] And I gotta say
[00:46:26] A thing or two here that might cannot come out clear in my book
[00:46:35] They arrived with a Mustang in europe
[00:46:40] And jimmy do little taken over the eighth air force
[00:46:46] Made a significant impact on the air war in europe and the eventual downfall of germany
[00:46:54] What was the what was what was the correlation there? Okay, let's see
[00:47:02] In late 43
[00:47:05] The eighth air force
[00:47:08] But their b-17s b-24s
[00:47:13] Had a bombing halt they stopped doing what they were doing
[00:47:17] And they're making you know they were supposed to kill the luft waf so we could have the invasion
[00:47:26] of of europe
[00:47:28] And you can't go without it
[00:47:31] you got to kill the
[00:47:34] enemies air
[00:47:36] and
[00:47:38] The way they were trying to do it was uh, they thought they could do it alone. They thought they could go without
[00:47:45] it
[00:47:46] fighter escort or anybody
[00:47:50] And they forgot to tell the luft waf of about it and they were having tremendous losses
[00:47:58] So they have a
[00:47:59] Bombing halt and said okay. We've got to have escort we
[00:48:05] And they said oh by the way then pioneer Mustang group is over here in europe
[00:48:10] In the ninth air force which was a tactical air force that was going to go with the invasion
[00:48:20] And they put the pioneer Mustang was signed to it the ninth air force
[00:48:26] Said we understand they have pretty good range and everything. Why don't we try them so they've blown the uh
[00:48:34] through 54th fighter group the
[00:48:36] uh pioneer group to the
[00:48:40] 8th air force and they were so wildly successful
[00:48:45] That they air for 8th air force demanded that they get
[00:48:49] p-51s
[00:48:51] We're the next one coming
[00:48:53] so we go
[00:48:55] Almost directly to the 8th air force. We were we were assigned to the ninth for a short time
[00:49:03] and uh
[00:49:05] When we got our airplanes
[00:49:08] well then
[00:49:10] tactics
[00:49:12] The 8th air force was in charge
[00:49:16] and the 8th fighter command
[00:49:18] Told us how to escort
[00:49:22] They said we want to see you we want you close
[00:49:25] Uh when the enemy comes in we want just to drive it away and
[00:49:36] When just drive them away and then come back
[00:49:41] You know is this this being videoed? Yes, it is people people to be able to watch your hands
[00:49:48] Fighter pilots can't tell their story without using their hands
[00:49:52] It's impossible if I had to put my hands down here. I couldn't tell you we would just stop recording
[00:50:00] No, we can see you and they can see you and so uh
[00:50:05] So their tactic was just we actually had uh
[00:50:09] An altitude limit we we could take them to 18 000 feet if you haven't shot him down
[00:50:16] Break it off come back up
[00:50:18] It wasn't the way to do it as it turned out
[00:50:22] But we do what we're told
[00:50:26] And further they were um
[00:50:30] their ideas of um
[00:50:33] Oh, they have all the strategic air command was you know was their basic
[00:50:41] Uh thinking that the bombers could go in
[00:50:44] And didn't need help they could destroy the enemy's war making capability
[00:50:51] And the troops could just walk in
[00:50:54] Well, like I said, they didn't tell the Luftwaffe about it
[00:50:59] So um
[00:51:02] They were even so upset. Oh, they were bombing factories oil
[00:51:08] Anything to do with a production of fighters or just fighters on the ground, you know inventory
[00:51:20] So uh
[00:51:22] The the chief of staff was so upset about it. He uh
[00:51:28] Had given them several
[00:51:31] Written instructions
[00:51:33] You got to kill the
[00:51:38] Luftwaffe
[00:51:40] And they just weren't doing it
[00:51:43] So they fired the 8th Air Force commander
[00:51:47] And brought in Jimmy Doolittle
[00:51:50] Who had a personal talk with the chief of staff
[00:51:54] And he said Jimmy Doolittle
[00:51:58] The mission is to destroy the Luftwaffe
[00:52:01] I don't care how you do it
[00:52:04] And so
[00:52:06] He was well, you guys all know who he is and what
[00:52:11] Things he'd done
[00:52:13] Doolittle read shortly after Pearl Harbor, you know incredible stuff
[00:52:18] Blind flying
[00:52:21] And uh
[00:52:23] So he was more primal and uh
[00:52:28] He uh
[00:52:30] He came down to I didn't know this I read it in his book later
[00:52:38] He came down to visit the 8th fighter command headquarters
[00:52:44] I went you know
[00:52:47] first time
[00:52:49] And they walked through and they had this single visit door
[00:52:54] The mission of the 8th fighter command is to bring the bombers home safely
[00:52:58] Something like that
[00:53:00] He said
[00:53:03] Who put that who put that up there?
[00:53:07] And general Kepner said I don't know it was here when I got here
[00:53:13] And he says well tear it down
[00:53:16] The mission of the 8th fighter command
[00:53:20] Is to destroy the Luftwaffe
[00:53:24] No more 18,000 feet
[00:53:26] Now it was pursuing destroy that was of official
[00:53:32] Our orders were now you fighters you're turned loose
[00:53:40] And you know we had felt like we were my first month I guess I was old there was under those
[00:53:48] restrictions
[00:53:50] And we did have the feeling that you were tight you know you had your hands by we wanted to get into the fight
[00:53:59] We just
[00:54:00] Were also eager
[00:54:03] It was incredible
[00:54:05] And what that happened he turned that the energy loose
[00:54:10] And that's actually
[00:54:12] How we defeated the Luftwaffe
[00:54:15] We shot down their experience test pilots one by one
[00:54:21] And by spring
[00:54:25] Oh no that's the spring of 41
[00:54:29] 41 yeah
[00:54:31] And
[00:54:33] The invasion was
[00:54:36] Was planned for
[00:54:38] 6th June
[00:54:40] And
[00:54:42] So by the you know by May
[00:54:49] The Germans could not put up a mass
[00:54:53] Against us
[00:54:55] Well, we were we were putting up
[00:54:57] thousand bombers
[00:54:59] and
[00:55:00] Eight nine hundred fighters maybe you know that would be the maximum we go we get those kind of missions
[00:55:09] and
[00:55:11] When we were trying to do it the beginning
[00:55:18] The Germans would put up a big a big fuss about it
[00:55:23] I mean hundreds of airplanes
[00:55:26] and
[00:55:27] By they by May
[00:55:30] They could not do that anymore
[00:55:33] And that allowed the
[00:55:37] Invasion to start
[00:55:39] And led to the eventual
[00:55:42] downfall of
[00:55:44] Of Germany
[00:55:46] And I credit general do little
[00:55:52] Turning the fighter pilots loose
[00:55:54] his policies
[00:55:57] And they were able to the Mustang of having a significant impact
[00:56:02] on the war in Europe
[00:56:05] when you guys
[00:56:06] Took the Mustang out when you're flying it how much intel did you have
[00:56:12] About the enemy fighters. Did you know when you got that
[00:56:15] Mustang up going as fast as it could go. Did you think to yourself or did you know?
[00:56:20] Hey, the mischishment can only go this fast the Junker can only go that fast
[00:56:25] Did you did you you know nowadays?
[00:56:26] We kind of analyze maybe even over analyze the enemy, but we have pretty good intelligence about what their capabilities are
[00:56:32] When you got that Mustang did you pretty quickly realize you were going to have the upper hand?
[00:56:38] Pretty pretty soon. I felt I felt like I learned it real quick
[00:56:46] Uh, especially in altitude I learned later that um
[00:56:53] A measure smith in the hands of a good pilot down low
[00:56:58] Could give a Mustang a hard time
[00:57:00] Mm-hmm, but I never experienced that
[00:57:07] Fortunately, I guess I'd like to say a little bit about the Pacific of the
[00:57:19] European theater
[00:57:22] The airplanes in the in the European war
[00:57:26] We're all very close in performance
[00:57:32] 109 190
[00:57:36] Uh, not the the twin engine ones. You could just forget them first guy there got the most
[00:57:44] Um
[00:57:54] Oh so compared to the zero, you know where you had to we had we had and
[00:58:02] We're faster and could climb higher and they were
[00:58:05] But don't turn with a zero, you know, it's what I
[00:58:09] get I never had to but I
[00:58:11] that's when I
[00:58:13] heard
[00:58:15] intelligence
[00:58:17] Reports
[00:58:21] Therefore I'd say in Europe
[00:58:25] The pilots made a lot of difference
[00:58:29] Whereas not so much in the
[00:58:32] Japanese theater
[00:58:34] You you you had to use tactics, you know, don't dogfight
[00:58:39] So
[00:58:44] I think that that that was a factor in the
[00:58:48] In the European war
[00:58:51] Where was I?
[00:58:52] No, that's it. You were just wanting to point out the differences and we it's
[00:58:56] We have to bring up your bird. You your bird was named old crow
[00:59:04] After the whiskey
[00:59:06] Well, I tell my Baptist friends it's named after the most intelligent bird that flies in the sky
[00:59:15] But my drinking buddies all know it is named after that bourbon
[00:59:20] And I wouldn't call it good old anymore because it's it it's down on the bottom shelf
[00:59:28] It was the cheapest stuff we could find
[00:59:30] Oh, yeah, it's great these pictures of your of your bird
[00:59:36] Uh, you know, you can see very prominently. It's painted old crow is on there. Everybody knew who you were
[00:59:43] Uh, you know just talking about these bomber escort missions a little bit you go over some of the stuff in the book
[00:59:47] But the the bomber crew tour
[00:59:50] Was 25 missions. That's something that a lot of people talk about that that if you were in a bomber crew
[00:59:55] You had to go and execute
[00:59:57] 25 missions if you got through 25 missions, you were done. You could go home
[01:00:03] Now what's interesting is as you pull as you pull the
[01:00:07] The thread on that number
[01:00:10] Well, they expected and anticipated
[01:00:13] That on each one of these big bombing missions there was going to be 4 losses
[01:00:19] So what does that mean? You take somebody with a 4 chance of getting shot down you multiply that times 25 and you get 100
[01:00:25] percent chance of getting shot down is what they had these
[01:00:28] Bomber guys doing and what's it what's even scarier than that was that the actual life expectancy the actual
[01:00:36] Number that you would get shot down on it was between 12 and 14 missions. So the 4 was a low number
[01:00:43] now
[01:00:44] interestingly my great uncle who I'm named after his name was George Gretin my middle name is Gretin
[01:00:50] And he was a bombardier in the 306th bomb group and he he was uh
[01:00:56] He flew in a b-17
[01:00:58] Which was known as tarheel peggie
[01:01:02] And tarheel peggie
[01:01:04] Was shot down on april 24th 1944 and this was right when you were flying in that area
[01:01:11] I don't know if you flew on that day, but he was shot down april 24th 1944
[01:01:16] There was 10 crew members on board as you were talking about five were killed and five were killed
[01:01:22] Five were made it out parachuted down
[01:01:26] Became POWs that actually includes my great uncle George Gretin
[01:01:30] He was a POW and he survived prison camp and eventually came home
[01:01:34] But that job that you guys had
[01:01:37] To go and protect these bombers that were going in and you you mentioned a little bit of the scale
[01:01:42] Uh, here's the scale of some of these missions that you all were doing. There was there was this operation
[01:01:49] Which was called operation argument, which you refer to in the book as the big week
[01:01:55] That started it. So the big week
[01:01:59] On one of these one one mission. This is one mission happening
[01:02:03] 417 b-17s hit one set of targets
[01:02:07] 314 b-17s hit another set of targets
[01:02:12] 272 b-24s hit another set of targets
[01:02:17] So so right there you've got what's almost a thousand bombers heading in and they were escorted by
[01:02:26] 94 p-38s
[01:02:29] 668 p-47s and 73 p-51 mustangs
[01:02:35] This this like level
[01:02:38] A scale of combat is something we can't my generation Dave's generation
[01:02:44] We can't even comprehend what it means to have a thousand aircraft Dave
[01:02:48] What was the most number of aircraft you had in the sky over iraq or afghanistan?
[01:02:53] The missions that it was probably a big one was in the 20s 24 airplanes
[01:02:56] That was a mission commander for 24 airplanes and that was a handful
[01:03:00] Yeah, so what does it look like when you're in the air with close to 1500 or 2000 aircraft?
[01:03:10] Well, the beast the bombers would go in they take off real early in the morning
[01:03:17] assemble and then
[01:03:20] Get get lined up and all start climbing at the same time
[01:03:24] And especially in the winter or cold temperatures up there
[01:03:34] We'd leave
[01:03:38] Intense
[01:03:41] What the hell am I trying to oh like trails contrails and
[01:03:47] They would last
[01:03:49] You know, they were long
[01:03:51] And last we sometimes we made our own overcasts with all these
[01:03:58] Then the fighters
[01:04:00] Join them later
[01:04:03] You know
[01:04:06] We could see them we could see them for a hundred miles, you know forget up on top of
[01:04:12] the last overcast and
[01:04:16] And so we went ahead and we had a heading
[01:04:19] And he'd arrive up there
[01:04:23] Hopefully at the proper time
[01:04:26] But if it wasn't
[01:04:28] You remember on the tails of the b-17s they put these big letters
[01:04:34] Square d a
[01:04:37] Big big letters
[01:04:40] We would join see what the letters were
[01:04:43] And then fly up and down and find ours
[01:04:46] God it was
[01:04:47] It sounds
[01:04:52] It sounds hard, but actually when you're doing it every day
[01:04:56] It wasn't so bad, you know, just kind of routine go up here. Okay. Oh
[01:05:01] That's not ours
[01:05:03] You know go up here and there go back and would you would you be assigned to one bomber or like a group of
[01:05:10] How many how many would you would you and your team be covering?
[01:05:13] Well, that's a good question. They flew in little three-shot bees
[01:05:23] And there'd be about 60 of those
[01:05:27] 60 more 60 more 60 more
[01:05:32] And um
[01:05:38] We would
[01:05:40] God, I don't know
[01:05:43] You covered just justice. Well, how many how many different radio frequencies would you have?
[01:05:50] Four different radio frequencies and you just flip from channel to channel
[01:05:55] Was there a common frequency? How can you have a common frequency with a thousand or two thousand aircraft? Well, that was the
[01:06:03] Emergency channel got it
[01:06:07] Everybody and his brother was on
[01:06:09] That must have just been like filled with chatter the whole time. Yeah, that was really
[01:06:16] And then you had a bomber fighter
[01:06:21] Then we had our
[01:06:24] Our own channel
[01:06:28] And we used that sometimes to come home we did we'd get a steer
[01:06:34] We'd uh, we'd get a practice steer, you know, what's it? What do you mean by that? What's a practice steer?
[01:06:44] Just terminology, but what does it mean? I don't know what it means Dave. You know what it means
[01:06:49] I think he's talking about giving you a vector
[01:06:51] So so you knew which way to go to get back to where you needed to be
[01:06:54] And you wouldn't want to say he didn't you wouldn't want to say I really need this now
[01:07:00] You know it was a practice
[01:07:01] You don't want to admit your you need a heading so he gave me a practice steering
[01:07:05] They go I want you to go 180 and and that was them telling you how to get home without having to admit it
[01:07:16] You probably use somebody else's voice when you're asking for those practice steers so you didn't sound like yourself
[01:07:24] Um
[01:07:26] Yeah, it's just hard for us to even imagine a 2000 aircraft in the sky. What do you when you're when you're flying in
[01:07:33] What's your first indication? How do you know it's how do you know the enemy's coming?
[01:07:36] Is it the first the anti aircraft that starts to come up the ack ack? No, you got that all the time
[01:07:43] That's just whenever they felt flew over
[01:07:47] Um, we're all wrong place
[01:07:50] Um
[01:07:52] And is that just a matter of chance whether it hits you or not some the fighters we didn't we didn't worry too much about the flag
[01:08:01] That was that really was after the
[01:08:05] bombers
[01:08:07] But they would shoot us
[01:08:09] too
[01:08:10] You were talking one time about looking off in the distance and and it looked like little gray puffs of smoke
[01:08:16] You'd see hundreds of airplanes and you and I guess probably chuck yeager more than anybody
[01:08:20] But you could see the enemy aircraft coming
[01:08:23] But it didn't look like airplanes at first. I think your description was almost it looked like little clouds
[01:08:29] Yeah, and it used to be that was a little hundred ship
[01:08:36] No, that's another thing that you know that we had to get used to
[01:08:42] In practice
[01:08:45] We were lucky to um
[01:08:47] Sometimes get four ships up to practice formation. That was a big deal a four ship
[01:08:57] We did a lot of two
[01:09:00] for formation training
[01:09:04] And every day
[01:09:08] In england when we flew we flew with
[01:09:12] 16 ship formation per squadron
[01:09:18] three squadrons
[01:09:20] lead one over here and one over here
[01:09:24] and uh
[01:09:28] Two spares they flew across the channel
[01:09:32] turn around
[01:09:34] if they weren't needed
[01:09:37] and
[01:09:38] flies through two or three
[01:09:40] layers of overcast
[01:09:43] Probably more likely than not
[01:09:48] And we had never never flew
[01:09:53] I don't I think I can remember flying in a group formation one time
[01:09:58] in training
[01:10:00] Were there mishaps
[01:10:02] with
[01:10:03] Fighters hitting each other and american fighters and bombers just on the way over to the target
[01:10:08] Did that happen or was it was it pretty well coordinated guys figured it out really fast?
[01:10:13] It was pretty good
[01:10:15] considering
[01:10:17] but
[01:10:18] My own flight. I lost a wingman
[01:10:22] two flights here
[01:10:24] and
[01:10:26] Climbing through
[01:10:29] And somehow these two guys drift together
[01:10:33] One of the worst ones I ever saw was
[01:10:35] uh
[01:10:37] B17s, you know how you can have days when you can
[01:10:42] Look down and see pretty good, but you can't see forward
[01:10:48] Well, there was a lot of those
[01:10:51] and
[01:10:52] We see these two columns of b17s
[01:10:56] We're sitting up here
[01:10:59] And they're going along at the same rate
[01:11:02] So you can see it looking down? Yeah, and they're same altitude
[01:11:08] And they're going
[01:11:10] And they got a mission recall
[01:11:13] Canceled the mission
[01:11:16] And these guys went like this
[01:11:18] Oh my god, you could see it coming, you know
[01:11:23] Nothing you can do
[01:11:25] You know, they lost about four guns right there
[01:11:28] That was a hell of a sight to see a bomber go down. I mean to us
[01:11:39] Oh
[01:11:43] You you um
[01:11:45] Going to the book here a little bit and when you're you're now flying you say we were fighter pilots
[01:11:51] Flying the damnedest fastest most lethal airplanes anyone ever dreamed up the forward line in defense
[01:12:00] Of the entire free world
[01:12:03] We were 22 years old give or take two years and carrying the entire war on our shoulders
[01:12:08] And doing a pretty good job of it too to judge by what the new newspapers told us
[01:12:14] We were winning the fight and developing egos that would make musselini look humble
[01:12:19] We weren't like other people at least not in our own minds
[01:12:24] We were bolder braver smarter more spirited
[01:12:29] Better
[01:12:30] Our eyesight was keener our reflexes quicker. We were risk takers too who worked and played hard
[01:12:37] We were confident self-reliant able to stand on our own and proud of it
[01:12:42] Most of all we were motivated
[01:12:45] aggressive
[01:12:46] Only the fittest and most competitive survived the training and then the deadly winnowing out imposed by our last and best teacher
[01:12:54] the german air force
[01:12:56] I was no fighter by nature at least not with my fists. I can count the fights of my youth on one hand
[01:13:02] But I enjoyed competing and racing cars or dueling with airplanes
[01:13:06] Was a way of compensating for my slender build and testing myself against anyone
[01:13:11] I enjoyed combat which is not quite the same thing as saying that I enjoyed killing
[01:13:18] Combat was exciting
[01:13:19] Addictive a test of our metal and manhood a crucible in which men became a cut above the ordinary
[01:13:27] We thought that we we thought we were that and we were encouraged to think it all through our training
[01:13:34] Because we couldn't have done what we did without thinking it
[01:13:37] Why else would they have let us fly under bridges and buzz people's houses?
[01:13:41] It took a big ego to fly to Berlin with anything resembling enthusiasm
[01:13:45] We were never afraid most of us anyway. I truly believe that scared sometimes you would have to be stupid not to be concerned
[01:13:54] respectful
[01:13:55] But never afraid the way a little kid is afraid of the dark or the way you might fear some dark alley knowing something is there waiting for you
[01:14:03] Waiting for you. We were so young. I suppose we just didn't know any better
[01:14:09] Combat is like a near miss in an automobile
[01:14:13] It happens and you react instinctively to it and later on you might say
[01:14:18] That was close and your fingers might tremble a little but while it's happening you don't pause to assess it and say
[01:14:24] My god, I'm going to die here
[01:14:26] There simply isn't time. You just do what you have to do
[01:14:29] I never saw a man crack not in our group. I don't remember anyone standing down because he was what we called
[01:14:37] Flack happy
[01:14:39] There was a guy who lost a brother and wept openly every so often about it
[01:14:44] But he flew he did his job
[01:14:47] Nobody had to be lifted out of his cockpit frozen up staring
[01:14:51] Stress at least in our corner of England wasn't what hollywood might have you believe
[01:14:56] Although it was there no denying it
[01:15:03] So there's the attitude
[01:15:05] You know you point something else you point something else out in here. I had a violet, right?
[01:15:10] sir
[01:15:11] This is like I have to deal with Dave all the time on this stuff
[01:15:14] The description couldn't be better. It's written perfectly
[01:15:19] You also mentioned in the book and I don't think I have it marked out to read but
[01:15:23] You talk about how when you look at the films that they made
[01:15:27] after the war
[01:15:28] All the pilots are 30 30 30 years old or 35 years old
[01:15:33] You know in the in the famous world war II fighter pilots
[01:15:37] And you say it was a bunch of kids that were 20 21 22 years old
[01:15:42] Yeah
[01:15:43] That's right
[01:15:46] I'm going to go to a little combat here
[01:15:48] Flying skill I've always felt meant more in Europe than it did in other theaters where the airplanes had different
[01:15:54] differing strong points the p38 was successful in the pacific
[01:15:58] Although it couldn't turn with the zero because it was much faster when diving
[01:16:02] Its pilot could attack from above and then keep going and the zero had no chance of catching it
[01:16:06] Same with the p40 earlier on
[01:16:09] The fog wolves and measurements had more speed
[01:16:12] The pacific tactics wouldn't work on these aircraft and the p38s was much less effective against them
[01:16:19] To beat them you had to turn with them like i'm turning with this 109
[01:16:24] Right now northwest of Hanover. We're flying in interlocking circles, but on differing planes
[01:16:31] Descending we pass one another once twice three times at ridiculous angles
[01:16:38] With neither of us in a position to fire
[01:16:40] I feel like i'm gaining but not very much and i'm excited and impatient and getting terribly frustrated that I can't get a shot
[01:16:48] I've worked the angle down to where our paths are crossing at 40 to 60 degrees
[01:16:53] What you want ideally is zero to 10 with the enemy either moving almost directly away or coming almost straight at you
[01:17:01] Anything over 30 degrees. It's almost pointless to shoot with a fixed sight
[01:17:06] Of course these same numbers this same geometry problem are probably running through the mind of the meserschmitt pilot
[01:17:15] I'd been considered a rather good marksman in the p39 and t6 at both our gunnery school and later at the rafs
[01:17:22] Now i've flown nine missions triggered my guns only once and still have no kills, but i'm cocky enough to try something bizarre
[01:17:30] I decide to pull my sights through the german keep pulling my nose up until i can't see him then fire
[01:17:37] Hose him and hope against all odds that he flies through the stream. What the hell worth a try?
[01:17:44] I pull up and fire off a quick stream of tracer as he disappears underneath me
[01:17:50] And another for luck. I ease the stick back and he flies back into my view hot damn
[01:17:55] Hot damn. He's spilling coolant back into his slipstream. I got him
[01:18:01] Got a goddamn golden bb on him
[01:18:04] Punctured his radiator or severed a coolant line got my first kill
[01:18:10] And while i'm whooping like i just scored the touchdown that won the rolls bow rolls bowl
[01:18:16] He throws the canopy off and bails out
[01:18:19] His 109 goes straight in
[01:18:22] exploding
[01:18:24] That's your first kill right there
[01:18:27] Still putting a smile on your face
[01:18:29] You haven't read the rest about there. Well, yeah after this a guy sneaks up on you, but luckily it's it's another p51, right?
[01:18:40] Yeah
[01:18:42] Yeah, uh, what happened afterwards
[01:18:47] I felt
[01:18:49] Oh, you know, I got a here's a guy. He's flying close formation with me right now. He pulled right up there
[01:18:58] pretty quick after the
[01:19:00] the kill
[01:19:03] How do you down low he had his mask off and he was grinning and he gave me something like that, you know, or
[01:19:10] I don't know. I didn't and I thought wait a minute
[01:19:14] Did he shoot that thing down out from under me? You know
[01:19:17] And I thought I my shot had to be the luckiest shot in the world, you know
[01:19:24] to be able to
[01:19:26] Blindly get that lead
[01:19:29] And then see him come through
[01:19:32] So all the way home I
[01:19:36] I convinced myself. I probably did not shoot that airplane down that he got it
[01:19:41] And it was Johnny England England Air Force Base. That was the guy that the base was named for
[01:19:50] And so I get home. He's in a different squadron
[01:19:54] and I
[01:19:58] Get home
[01:20:00] I make a claim to the intelligence
[01:20:04] Officer briefing
[01:20:06] And then I said but just hold it. I got to go get confirmation from a
[01:20:13] Guy that's obviously saw what was going on
[01:20:19] So now I'm riding uh
[01:20:22] Going in the jeep or to the officer's club and can you tell who the other pilot is or you just know what squadron he is
[01:20:29] No, I know who he was. Oh, so you could see him. You're that close to him. You look at
[01:20:32] Oh, yeah, I got his mask and I could see his
[01:20:37] The name on his airplane. He already had two kills
[01:20:41] and so
[01:20:44] I think how am I going to bring this up?
[01:20:47] You know, am I going to say hey you asshole?
[01:20:51] Did oh, you could you could bleep this out
[01:20:55] You're good. You're good. We're amongst friends
[01:20:58] I I asked, oh, did you shoot that thing down out from under me?
[01:21:04] um
[01:21:06] Or you know, just how am I going to
[01:21:10] Put it to him
[01:21:12] So I go in the officers club and he's over here
[01:21:17] He sees me and he comes running over to me
[01:21:21] And he says Andy
[01:21:23] He says that was the best shot I've ever seen. You got that guy out there about 60 degrees angle off
[01:21:29] I said, oh Johnny
[01:21:32] Lucky shot
[01:21:34] And as soon as we were through I rushed to my phone and I got my first kill. There you go
[01:21:41] Did you guys put the did you guys put the the swastika on your plane the little mini swastika for a kill very quickly very quickly?
[01:21:53] Oh, that's awesome
[01:21:55] uh
[01:21:56] You got a section in here
[01:21:59] um
[01:22:01] That it's about another dogfight and I I believe it's probably the one you remember the best you
[01:22:06] It's called the straight up encounter. Oh, yeah
[01:22:09] And I've got to read this. This is just an incredible
[01:22:13] um
[01:22:15] Situation here and I'm going to go to the book
[01:22:18] I am in this steep climb
[01:22:21] Pulling the stick into my navel making it steeper steeper
[01:22:26] And I'm looking back down over my shoulder at this classic gray
[01:22:30] Me 109 with black crosses that is pulling up to steeper steeper the pilot trying to get his nose up just a little bit more
[01:22:39] And bring me into his sights
[01:22:42] There's nothing distinctive about the aircraft no fancy markings
[01:22:46] Nothing to identify it is the plane of an ace as as one of the dreaded yellow noses like you see in the movie
[01:22:53] Some of them did that I know but I never saw one
[01:22:56] And in any event all of their aces weren't flamboyant types who splash plane on their paint on their airplanes to show who they were
[01:23:05] He was someone who was trying to kill me is all
[01:23:07] So I'm looking back almost straight down now and I can see this 20 millimeter
[01:23:14] Canon sticking through the middle of the fighters propeller hub
[01:23:19] In the theater of memory. It was enormous
[01:23:22] an elephant gun
[01:23:25] And that isn't far wrong
[01:23:26] It is a gun designed to bring down a bomber one that fires shells as long as your hand
[01:23:32] Shells that explode and tear big holes in metal
[01:23:35] Is the single most frightening thing I have seen in my life then and now
[01:23:43] But I'm too busy to be frightened
[01:23:45] And I am extremely busy up here
[01:23:48] Hanging by my propeller going almost straight up full emergency power
[01:23:54] Which a Mustang could do for only so long before losing speed
[01:23:58] shuttering
[01:23:59] Stalling and falling back down and I am thinking that if the Mustang stalls before the Messerschmitt stalls
[01:24:06] I have had it
[01:24:09] I look back
[01:24:10] And I can see that he's shuttering on the verge of a stall
[01:24:14] He hasn't been able to get his nose up enough hasn't been able to bring that big gun to bear almost but not quite
[01:24:23] I'm a fallen down dead man almost
[01:24:26] but not quite
[01:24:28] His nose begins dropping just as my airplane too begins shuttering
[01:24:33] He stalls a second or two before I stall drops away before I do
[01:24:39] Good old Mustang
[01:24:42] He is falling away now and I flop the nose over and go after him hard
[01:24:47] We are very high by this time six miles and then some and falling very very fast
[01:24:52] The Messerschmitt had a head start plummeting out of my range, but I'm closing up quickly
[01:24:57] Then he flattens out and comes around hard to the left and starts climbing again as if he wants to come at me head on
[01:25:05] Suddenly we were right back where we started
[01:25:08] A lot of this is just instinct now things are happening too fast to think everything out
[01:25:13] You stay with your right hand and feet
[01:25:15] The right hand also triggers the guns with your left you work the throttle and keep the airplane in trim
[01:25:20] Which is easier to do than to describe
[01:25:23] Any airplane with a single propeller produces torque the more horsepower you have the more prop will pull you off to one side
[01:25:32] The Mustang I flew used a 12 cylinder Packard Merlin engine that displaced
[01:25:38] 1649 cubic inches
[01:25:42] That's 10 times the size of the engine that powers an Indy car
[01:25:46] It developed power enough that you never applied full power sitting still on the ground because it would pull the plane's tail up off the runway
[01:25:54] And the propeller would chew up the concrete
[01:25:56] With so much power you are continually making minor adjustments on the controls to keep the Mustang and its wing mounted guns pointed straight
[01:26:07] It's a little unnerving to think about how many things you have to deal with all at once to fly combat
[01:26:13] So the mischish mid is coming around again climbing hard to his left and I've had about enough of this
[01:26:20] My angle is a little bit better this time
[01:26:22] So I roll the dice instead of cobbling it like before and sailing on by him
[01:26:27] I decide to turn hard left inside him knowing that if I lose speed and don't make it I probably won't get home
[01:26:37] I pull back on the throttle slightly
[01:26:40] I pull back on the throttle slightly put down 10 degrees of flaps and haul back on the stick just as hard as I can
[01:26:49] The nose begins coming around
[01:26:51] slowly slowly
[01:26:54] Hot damn. I'm going to make it. I'm inside him pulling my sights up to him
[01:27:00] And the German pilot can see this
[01:27:02] This time it's the mesheshmit that breaks away and goes zooming straight up engine at maximum power without much alternative
[01:27:10] I come in with full power and follow him up and the gap narrows swiftly
[01:27:16] He is hanging by his prop not quite vertically and I am right there behind him
[01:27:21] And it is terribly clear having tested this theory less than a minute ago that he is going to stall and fall away before I do
[01:27:30] I have him
[01:27:32] He must know that I have him
[01:27:34] I bring my nose up he comes into my sights and from less than 300 yards I trigger a long merciless burst from my brownings
[01:27:44] Every fifth bullet or so is a tracer leaving a trail of thin smoke marking the path of the bullet stream
[01:27:51] The tracers race upward and find him the bullets chew at the wing root the cockpit the engine
[01:27:58] making bright little flashes
[01:28:01] I hose the mesheshmit down the way you'd hose down a campfire methodically from one end to the other not wanting to make a mistake
[01:28:09] The 109 shakes like a retriever coming out of the water throwing off pieces
[01:28:16] He slows almost stops as if parked in the sky his propeller just wind milling
[01:28:22] And he begins smoking heavily
[01:28:24] My momentum carries me to him. I throttle back to ease my plane alongside just off his right wing
[01:28:30] Have I killed him? I do not particularly want to fight this man again
[01:28:35] I'm coming up even with the cockpit
[01:28:37] Cockpit and although I figure less I know about him the better. I find myself looking in spite of myself
[01:28:45] There's smoke in the cockpit. I can see that and nothing more
[01:28:50] Another few feet
[01:28:52] And then he falls away suddenly left wing down right wing rising up obscuring my view
[01:28:59] I am looking at the 109's sky blue belly the wheel wells twin radiators grease marks
[01:29:05] Streaks from the guns the black crosses
[01:29:08] I am close enough to make out the rivets
[01:29:11] The mesheshmit is right there and then it is gone just like that rolling away and dropping its nose
[01:29:17] Falling almost straight down leaking coolant and trailing flame and smoke so black and thick it has to be smoke or oil
[01:29:27] It simply plunges headed straight for the deck no spin not even a wobble no parachute
[01:29:34] And now I am wondering
[01:29:36] His ship seems a death ship
[01:29:39] But is it
[01:29:41] Undecided I peel off and begin chasing him down
[01:29:43] Did I squander a chance here? Have I let him escape? He's diving hard through
[01:29:49] He is diving hard enough to be shedding his wings harder than anyone designed those airplanes to dive
[01:29:55] 500 miles an hour and more and if 109's will stall sooner then the Mustang is going straight up
[01:30:01] Now I am worrying mate that maybe their wings stay on longer
[01:30:06] At 25,000 feet I begin to grow nervous
[01:30:09] At 25,000 feet I begin to grow nervous
[01:30:13] I pull back on the throttle ease out of the dive and watch him go down
[01:30:18] I have no more stomach for this kind of thing and right now
[01:30:21] Not right now not with this guy
[01:30:25] enough
[01:30:26] Let him go and to hell with him
[01:30:29] Straight down he plunges
[01:30:31] From his highest 35,000 feet
[01:30:33] Through this beautiful crystal clear may morning toward the green on green checkerboard fields
[01:30:40] Leaving a wake of black smoke
[01:30:43] From four miles straight up I watch as the mischersmith and the shadow
[01:30:47] It makes on the ground rush toward one another
[01:30:51] And then finally
[01:30:54] Silently
[01:30:56] They merge
[01:31:05] I think I just found a guy for my my audio book
[01:31:10] I know how you feel
[01:31:14] That's just um
[01:31:16] Yeah, Dave what's your breakdown of that it's give us give us a breakdown. I I'm actually just
[01:31:27] I'm kind of at a loss for words and I know this sounds maybe even sounds a little arrogant
[01:31:31] I can picture what he's saying. So even when he's talking about
[01:31:35] He you're right here
[01:31:37] Sir, even when you're when you're talking about looking down your wing lines seeing his nose come up to you and you know
[01:31:42] If he's got two or three more degrees on you, which is which is kind of like a matter of inches really in an airplane
[01:31:50] that he's gonna get
[01:31:52] That this measurements gonna get a shot
[01:31:55] And the the sinking feeling that comes with seconds later the elation of watching him shudder and you know that he can't keep his turn
[01:32:03] even the angles and the fault so
[01:32:05] Your ability to get another pilot to see through their eyes what you're seeing
[01:32:09] Is it is it is remarkable how well it is written in a way to describe it
[01:32:18] So I can feel what you're seeing not just see it
[01:32:21] It is just unbelievable to listen you describe that
[01:32:25] And then the shadows you know merging with the airframe and then at your altitude
[01:32:29] It's probably a fireball, but you don't hear anything
[01:32:32] And everything in between there is just
[01:32:36] I have never seen something written
[01:32:38] Well enough to see it with my own eyes as what you wrote in that dogfight
[01:32:44] Um, it's it's really amazing for me to hear and I'm really grateful that you have the ability to get that on paper and capture that forever
[01:32:51] We may uh
[01:32:54] blame
[01:32:55] Joe hamlin. Yeah, well
[01:32:58] He didn't fly the airplane. I know that well the stories are all mine
[01:33:03] And when it came to
[01:33:05] Oh, well, we first had to get together
[01:33:10] And he'd go home and write
[01:33:13] A couple of chapters and then we would
[01:33:16] Come back and review them and I said Joe this word isn't even in my inventory
[01:33:23] You know and uh
[01:33:27] We'd go on and on like to say I don't even know what that means
[01:33:32] and
[01:33:34] We had that and then when it came to the flying
[01:33:40] He would try it and I said
[01:33:43] Joe give me a yellow pad over there
[01:33:47] And I'd write it all out in the long hand
[01:33:51] I said don't change a word
[01:33:54] And but after we got together so many times
[01:34:00] He really got into my head
[01:34:02] Yeah, he did a marvelous job
[01:34:06] And uh and then
[01:34:09] Even when I said don't change your word sometimes he'd try
[01:34:16] And I might or might not
[01:34:18] Leave it because he
[01:34:20] He was he is a good writer
[01:34:23] Absolutely, I would have taken my book and say
[01:34:27] I was born on January 13th 1922 blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah you know
[01:34:35] But you know the way he mixed
[01:34:37] Mixed it through the book, right? I think was really good. Yeah, no, that's so that's the just for everyone that's listening
[01:34:43] That's the the the co-author of the book that helped write the book
[01:34:48] Joe Hamlin did a great job
[01:34:51] When when you're so when you're looking over your shoulder at this measuresmith
[01:34:55] And they're start he's starting to stall
[01:34:58] So you can see that you can see the plane start to kind of shake I said
[01:35:03] I
[01:35:05] Seem shutter right but
[01:35:07] I don't think you can see it shutter shutters a feel in the airplane. You know you feel
[01:35:13] But there's some visual thing that's going on that you go. Oh, he's not gonna make it much
[01:35:18] Sloppy he got sloppy, you know, that's the beginning of a stall
[01:35:22] And that's the beginning of a stall and you can probably sense when you're about done
[01:35:28] Going up too. So you knew that you were close. Oh, yeah
[01:35:36] And then when you're shooting
[01:35:39] That that aircraft
[01:35:41] You have to make little micro adjustments with your nose to get like you're saying you hose it down like you would a campfire
[01:35:48] So you're making little tiny adjustments to kind of sweep up and down on that aircraft with your
[01:35:54] maneuvering. Yeah, you know maneuvering was maneuvering is just a little bit of rudder
[01:36:00] Yeah
[01:36:02] Small amount you had to keep it in trim
[01:36:06] And I don't what I mean in trim keep the ball centered
[01:36:11] If you had a ball off
[01:36:13] Then you're you know, you're shooting
[01:36:19] And the airplanes over here
[01:36:21] You can't you gotta you can't
[01:36:24] Oh, so this makes whereas normally you could get away with having trim be off a little bit because you're still just maintaining some kind of a bearing
[01:36:32] But in this situation if your trim is off a little bit your guns pointed in the wrong direction might might be you know
[01:36:37] And you've got you're making these constant micro adjustments and I actually
[01:36:40] That's a part of the book that I didn't quite go into the
[01:36:45] Level of detail that you have to do to keep that trim
[01:36:48] But I failed to understand why that's so important in a gunfight when you have fixed sights
[01:36:55] Because like if you're flying an aircraft, I mean I've taken off an air small airplanes before where there's a strong crosswind
[01:37:01] The plane is going if you look at the heading of the plane. It's like 10 degrees off the direction you're heading
[01:37:06] But you're still going in the right direction
[01:37:08] So if you do that with your gun that's going to be a problem
[01:37:12] So you've got to keep that thing perfectly trimmed all the time
[01:37:15] Dave you didn't have to do any of that. Well, he had a computer doing all this for him, sir
[01:37:19] Well, we we got the early computers
[01:37:23] You had it harder than I did because in a jet moving the throttles in a jet doesn't change your trim
[01:37:29] Every time you move the throttle on a propeller you change the torque
[01:37:33] Every movement of a throttle and I have a little bit of propeller time
[01:37:36] I learned to fly on a propeller airplane every time you move the throttle forward or back you have to adjust the rudder trim
[01:37:41] So when he talks about the ball, we called it stepping on the ball
[01:37:44] Which is a little literally a little gauge that has a little white
[01:37:48] background in a little black floating ball that would tell you if your nose and tail are aligned
[01:37:53] It'd be like pointing a gun with your wrist cocked in one direction or another
[01:37:57] Every time I move the throttle on the jet the computer said we're okay. Don't worry about it
[01:38:01] The ball is always centered every time in a prop prop you have to either use your feet or use the rudder trim
[01:38:07] So when he's talking about
[01:38:09] Moving the throttle what he's not saying is that every single movement of that throttle meant moving my feet
[01:38:15] Moving with my thumb moving my hand. So the the intricacy to be able to track
[01:38:20] An me 109 that's probably what 30 feet long and 30 feet wide
[01:38:24] We're the the the accuracy to do that is so precise to be able to do that in a dogfight like that is so hard to do
[01:38:34] I got the kernel here. It was like the humblest guy in the world saying Joe's a good writer, which I know he is
[01:38:38] But he didn't track that any 109 with his p51
[01:38:43] The way that you did so I still just it's remarkable that you're able to capture that and and I'm trying to do justice to how
[01:38:50] How difficult that is and how intricate that physical movement is in your airplane
[01:38:55] Also, the fact that you describe this one-on-one engagement that's something that I always loved as a fighter pilot
[01:39:01] Was ultimately at the very end what it would come down to you and somebody else
[01:39:05] But what's hard for for me to really truly grasp is that there's a war going on around you
[01:39:09] You weren't the only two airplanes in the sky at that time
[01:39:12] So your ability to compartmentalize and focus on this one airplane as part of a much larger thing going on is
[01:39:18] To me equally as remarkable and the thing is is that
[01:39:22] what we call
[01:39:25] situational awareness
[01:39:27] You have to do that. You have to know
[01:39:31] And I've got a real good example of when we were doing a dogfight
[01:39:37] I saw a shadow
[01:39:40] and
[01:39:42] When we were through I said hey guys, do you see anything shadow or anything? No, no, no
[01:39:50] Okay, come on down get lined up here. I said I knew it was going west generally speaking and
[01:39:57] So I go along here
[01:40:00] Pretty soon
[01:40:02] We come up and I see the shadow again
[01:40:06] Before I can see the airplane
[01:40:08] And that was a bright sunny day, you know, it was a green hungry
[01:40:16] Camel
[01:40:18] And if it'd been hazy I never would have seen him
[01:40:22] And so I come up and that's a hunk of 111 K
[01:40:28] Poor guy
[01:40:29] all obsolete
[01:40:32] Battle of Britain bomber
[01:40:35] and
[01:40:37] We had a gunner we silenced the gunner
[01:40:42] And we got both engines spoken
[01:40:45] And so I scored my I bumped back over here on the
[01:40:51] From this side to that side
[01:40:53] And I'm scoring them as they as they shoot
[01:40:58] So that's how you get a quarter of a kill
[01:41:01] share the whole thing
[01:41:03] And my number four guys a new head, you know new
[01:41:08] inexperienced guy and he
[01:41:10] He fired every round on one pass
[01:41:15] And you could imagine where the bullets were going
[01:41:21] He burned the barrels out, you know
[01:41:24] And we only had 30 seconds of
[01:41:27] of
[01:41:28] Gunfire
[01:41:30] Yeah, that's not not much. I know
[01:41:36] He come home a couple of times with no ammo
[01:41:41] How many seconds do you fire with that mesh which made on the in the straight up encounter?
[01:41:46] Three four five seconds something something like that. Yeah, that's still a lot of rounds to receive
[01:41:52] I don't want to be the receiving the 50 cows
[01:41:55] Uh you go on here
[01:42:00] Talking about that straight up encounter you say Eddie Simpson joins up with me both wingman two
[01:42:06] Simpson my old wingman and friend had gotten the one who'd climbed out. This is another aircraft
[01:42:12] We bagged three or four three of the four. We were very excited. It had been a good day
[01:42:17] I had lived and my opponent had died
[01:42:20] But it was a near thing
[01:42:22] It could have been the other way around just as easily and what probably made the difference was the airplane I flew
[01:42:29] Made in America
[01:42:32] I would live to see the day when people would try and tell me that the United States can't make cars like some other folks do
[01:42:38] What a laugh
[01:42:40] I didn't wonder if I just made a new bride a widow or if he might have kids any more than I would have wondered about a snake's
[01:42:47] mate in offspring
[01:42:49] I may have given some thought to how many of my friends he had killed or I might have or he might have killed in the future
[01:42:56] Or how many bombers he might have shot down had he lived
[01:42:59] But that's as far as it went
[01:43:01] From what I could tell he hadn't been overly concerned about me
[01:43:06] People ask about that all the time people usually ask it hesitantly as tactfully as they can but they ask it
[01:43:13] Did I wonder and worry about the mothers and children's and wives of the men I shot down?
[01:43:18] Did I carry any guilt or regret?
[01:43:22] No
[01:43:24] Not then and not now
[01:43:27] World war two was a total thing
[01:43:30] Us against them when being against them was unquestionably the right thing to be
[01:43:36] I flew from my country and was proud I could help in any way that I could
[01:43:42] Besides all of my opponents were trying to kill me
[01:43:45] And frankly I always was elated they hadn't
[01:43:52] This one had almost gotten a beat on me. He'd come as close as anyone would
[01:43:58] When it was done
[01:43:59] 480 hours of combat flying in p-51s and another 25 missions are so in vietnam almost all of those in f-105s
[01:44:08] I never once suffered a hit in air-to-air combat
[01:44:11] The sum total of the damage all my aircraft absorbed amounted to one small arms round
[01:44:18] That found one of my wings during a strafing run after d-day
[01:44:23] It bored a hole the size of my little finger
[01:44:26] It didn't even go all the way through just punctured the underside skin
[01:44:31] Nobody noticed it until the next day needing a patch the size of a coin
[01:44:35] That's exactly what my crew used a british shilling
[01:44:38] People on the ground often shot at me flak batteries machine gunners foot soldiers with rifles and pistols
[01:44:44] There may have been some who threw rocks who can say
[01:44:47] But this man on that day was the only opponent who was ever behind me and he couldn't quite bring me into his sights
[01:44:54] And he never did fire
[01:44:56] To my knowledge I was never I never was fired upon by an airplane in combat
[01:45:01] Skill had something to do with that. I suppose
[01:45:04] But there was certainly something more to it than skill
[01:45:08] Lots of hot pilots never came home
[01:45:11] I guess I was lucky
[01:45:13] or blessed
[01:45:18] Yeah, that american made p-51
[01:45:22] Was just next level in the sky, huh?
[01:45:25] When you guys were getting that thing it must have seemed like you know a lot of times for me, you know, I grew up
[01:45:30] I grew up the
[01:45:32] The p-51 was like an antique right it was like an antique thing
[01:45:37] But for you guys this was like a piece of
[01:45:40] The newest technology imaginable
[01:45:46] Just a just an incredible bird
[01:45:49] I mean Dave
[01:45:50] That's like you getting into an f-22 or an f-35 for the first time. It is
[01:45:56] I can't imagine, you know
[01:45:58] Certainly the the prominence of that air is just so much better
[01:46:01] The the prominence of that airplane, but it had to feel good to know
[01:46:06] And I fully appreciate and I'm so glad you wrote about it
[01:46:09] What it always came down to was the man in the in the cockpit. That's the ultimate
[01:46:14] Factor, but it had to feel good to know
[01:46:17] You were getting into an airplane
[01:46:19] That was gonna
[01:46:20] Level the playing field or give you an advantage over what the Germans had so you didn't have to mitigate
[01:46:26] The deficiencies of that p-39 or something else
[01:46:28] It had to be a confidence builder to say if you want to go fight me one to one
[01:46:33] Any in up down left right any environment this airplane will be just fine. So
[01:46:38] That feeling of getting into that p-51 knowing you're going to war had to be a lot better than what you might have been flying in anything else
[01:46:45] And I felt that when I got in my first fight in f-22
[01:46:49] I felt like
[01:46:50] I'll fight anybody anywhere. How did that happen? How did you?
[01:46:54] Be a marine. How would you do that if I can steal a line from your book?
[01:47:01] I was very lucky
[01:47:04] Yeah, a lot of timing a lot of just good fortune a lot of things just aligned the right place right time need
[01:47:10] requirements
[01:47:11] Qualifications and at the end it's really hard for me to take credit for being the only marine that's gotten to do it
[01:47:18] But I was very lucky. You're the only marine that got to fly the f-22 ever
[01:47:22] And the f-35 those marines that fly f-32. Yeah, I was the first marine only only marine to ever fly the raptor
[01:47:30] First marine to fly the f-35 be you know as operational. How'd you get how'd you get in the raptor?
[01:47:36] Short version of a long story the Marine Corps was going to buy
[01:47:41] F-35s is a whole new airplane. They didn't know
[01:47:45] How challenging it would be to go from old to new we hadn't done it in 30 years
[01:47:48] The Air Force had just introduced a new fighter called the f-22 to replace the f-15
[01:47:54] And they basically sent a spy go live with the Air Force for three years and learn all the lessons that they've just learned
[01:48:01] From going from the f-15 to the f-22
[01:48:03] We'll take those lessons and apply it as we replace the f-18s with the f-35
[01:48:08] So I got lucky to be selected for an exchange with the Air Force
[01:48:12] To learn all about the f-22 all about this new generation and all about the challenges of replacing a 30 40 year old
[01:48:18] airplane with the brand new airplane because the marine Corps hadn't done it since the early 80s
[01:48:23] And I was the guy that got to do it and I went straight from the f-22 to the f-35
[01:48:28] Lucky yeah, you two need to play the lottery
[01:48:33] So look I'm I I'm not going to read the whole book. You know, you've got a bunch of other encounters in here
[01:48:41] dogfights
[01:48:43] Incredible detail on the combat experience. You end up with 16 kills 16 and a quarter 16 and a quarter
[01:48:51] That's right. Don't let me leave off that quarter
[01:48:54] What what was the quarter for was the quarter for that one that you just described? Yeah, so there you go
[01:48:58] You got a little bit of that one too
[01:49:00] You end up with 16
[01:49:02] Kills you find you fly your last mission with Jaeger
[01:49:07] You guys are out there together. Okay
[01:49:11] um
[01:49:13] And again people get the book. It's incredible get those details
[01:49:18] But I'm gonna go back. I'm gonna skip forward a little bit here
[01:49:21] and you say
[01:49:24] I hadn't intended to get married. It just kind of happened
[01:49:27] I landed in the states on february 1st 1945 and married my pen pal
[01:49:33] the widow elinor cosby stacker 22 days later
[01:49:38] It took me a few days to get from the east coast to california and I know I asked her at least a week before we got married
[01:49:46] Figure it out. The courtship lasted no more than 10 days to two weeks pretty intense
[01:49:53] We were married three days before chuck and glennis
[01:49:57] It didn't sit all that well with our folks our moms didn't think it would last and you can understand why
[01:50:03] After we've been married about 20 years with our two kids almost grown
[01:50:09] My mother poured it all out to elinor. She told her I thought you'd run home to mama at the first sign of trouble
[01:50:16] I couldn't have been more wrong. You're a wonderful person. They had a good cry
[01:50:21] At another time el's own mother told her the same
[01:50:24] Ellie had been married to jack for two weeks and had mourned 15 months people thought she was vulnerable
[01:50:31] But she knew her own heart
[01:50:34] After 40 plus years. We're still happily married. No question. She's the best thing that ever happened to me
[01:50:40] Over the years. We've seen lots of couples break up
[01:50:43] Loving a fighter pilot is like loving a cop. He leaves work in the morning and you're never entirely sure he will come home at night
[01:50:52] Worse there are inescapable
[01:50:54] Inescapable agonizing periods of separation where the woman has to be both father and mother to the children
[01:51:01] Keep the house together manage the money and contend with the loneliness
[01:51:07] And there never is much money
[01:51:09] But we can look back and laugh now
[01:51:11] Surviving the trials is what brings people closer
[01:51:17] I ended up with 70 years
[01:51:21] She passed away
[01:51:28] And uh
[01:51:31] That's not in the
[01:51:34] That's a updated version, isn't it?
[01:51:37] I'm not sure which version is. I know I have two versions here. Let me see the cover
[01:51:41] The cover to this one
[01:51:43] I think this is the original one. I think this is the updated one. Oh, okay. Yeah, I have both versions
[01:51:51] Well, actually one of them's dave's version that he's had for 20 years or something
[01:51:56] What can I say about that the storybook romance, right? Right?
[01:52:02] No, it's um and then well
[01:52:05] What was like coming home and you I didn't mention this. It's in the book
[01:52:09] I came home for a little bit of leave in between and you got treated like the biggest hero in the history of America. Yeah
[01:52:16] Which is awesome
[01:52:19] But when you're now you come home again
[01:52:22] For good for for good so to speak
[01:52:25] Well, yeah, what you didn't know it would be for good. Maybe you would be going to japan or whatever
[01:52:30] But germany surrendered while you were back in america, right and
[01:52:34] So so how did that feel? Did you feel like we did it?
[01:52:39] I've
[01:52:41] I was pretty elated
[01:52:43] mm-hmm
[01:52:44] And you mentioned this in the book and I think it's definitely worth talking about so
[01:52:50] The 357th
[01:52:52] Who you are part of shot down 609 enemy aircraft
[01:52:57] 13 died in training
[01:52:59] 57 were killed in combat and that was from 16 accidents and then the others were killed in shot
[01:53:08] And there was 71
[01:53:10] POWs
[01:53:12] taken
[01:53:13] You had 28 original pilots in your crew in your group
[01:53:18] Nine of whom were killed seven of whom were shot down and became POWs
[01:53:24] Yeah 50 percent
[01:53:26] Oh
[01:53:29] You must have felt very lucky to be home
[01:53:33] Um
[01:53:34] But then it's like you're you're looking at japan, right? You had to be looking at japan like everybody else. Yeah
[01:53:40] It was always there. Yeah
[01:53:43] But but you ended up going to texas and did you become a flight instructor?
[01:53:47] Was that your job in texas? Yeah, but I had a lot of group, you know
[01:53:53] um
[01:53:54] I had a group of instructors
[01:53:57] and uh, I'm the I'm the
[01:54:00] group commander
[01:54:03] And I ride the I have to ride the
[01:54:06] I go to the
[01:54:09] Instructor school the central instructor school then come back
[01:54:16] And they only let me write do the wash rides
[01:54:20] What's a what's a wash ride?
[01:54:22] Tell a guy he's not gonna
[01:54:25] Make it. Oh, you're washing him out
[01:54:27] guys
[01:54:30] Uh, and then it's
[01:54:32] Next thing happens is so you're there working as an instructor and the next thing happens is vj day
[01:54:38] Yeah, and now the war is over. Yeah
[01:54:45] What was it what was the uh state what was the mindset of america on vj day?
[01:54:50] Uh just
[01:54:53] I don't know how to explain it but uh extreme joy
[01:54:59] And I don't think there's any remorse
[01:55:05] From a service man that served in that time about the use of the atomic bomb
[01:55:15] And I really
[01:55:17] true when
[01:55:19] He he did a good job. Yeah. Yeah
[01:55:23] No doubt about that and especially when you hear the stories from the guys that fought in the pacific
[01:55:28] On the ground against the japanese. I mean it was going to be absolutely
[01:55:34] horrendous if we had to go into mainland japan
[01:55:38] yeah, and
[01:55:41] You know, they were we know they were training their kids
[01:55:45] and the women to fight with sticks
[01:55:49] and hiding caves
[01:55:53] And
[01:55:56] We would have just wiped them out. Yeah, we would kill more japanese and then
[01:56:07] Americans, yeah
[01:56:10] Um
[01:56:12] So now that the war is over you you go and become a recruiter going for going recruiting duty
[01:56:18] Everybody's getting out
[01:56:21] Uh
[01:56:22] Yeager becomes a test pilot and it seems like he eventually recruits
[01:56:26] Basically recruits you to become a test pilot. Well, he allowed me to he got me a interview with the head of a flight test
[01:56:35] Uh
[01:56:37] You got a cool section in here during these test pilots a year test pilot years. Um
[01:56:44] Scary scary and I kind of wanted to
[01:56:47] Bring out the fact of what it was like being a test pilot because it was risky business back then
[01:56:53] Um, this section here you say on april 24th
[01:56:58] 1953 we took off in rendezvous with the b29 and a couple of chase planes at 25 000 feet
[01:57:04] In the chase aircraft were jake knight and bill ross the pilot scheduled to join john on the project
[01:57:11] I moved in on the b29
[01:57:13] Hooked onto its wingtip and again the dash panel light remained dark. No power damn
[01:57:20] Thoroughly frustrated by now
[01:57:22] I disconnected moved away from the mothership and davis moved in and hooked up
[01:57:27] So this was what you were trying to do what what we were trying to do as a country
[01:57:31] was get away to make the fighters be able to support the bombers longer and they devised some kind of system where you could actually take two fighter planes
[01:57:41] And hook into the wings of a big giant bomber that has a bunch of fuel and they're they would kind of pull you along
[01:57:50] Well, that that was one
[01:57:53] one um
[01:57:57] Concept that uh
[01:57:59] People latched on to
[01:58:02] but the basic program
[01:58:05] Was a theory by this german engineer that we brought back from world war two
[01:58:14] Uh to work work in right field
[01:58:19] And he theorized that you take a
[01:58:23] bomber
[01:58:25] If you could put a wing extension out here just a wing extension
[01:58:33] And you had some way of controlling it
[01:58:36] You increase the aspect ratio
[01:58:39] And that give you longer range
[01:58:44] And so they wanted to do it in a wind tunnel but they didn't have the priority and all that stuff so
[01:58:52] uh
[01:58:53] I said well, let's
[01:58:56] Let's try it with airplanes
[01:58:59] Well, that was okay except we haven't done that before
[01:59:04] And so that's why we developed the program with a c-47 and a little q-14
[01:59:12] And with a uh simple
[01:59:15] Locking mechanism like back again back again to it
[01:59:23] And then the drag would hold us it was a beveled ring
[01:59:28] Then we had a bevel ball with a with a dump bevel
[01:59:33] with a spike
[01:59:35] And it you had to go in front of it back end
[01:59:40] Which made about twice as hard
[01:59:43] and then
[01:59:44] it was
[01:59:46] locked when you pulled the throttle back
[01:59:50] But then if you wanted to get out just
[01:59:52] have throttle to it
[01:59:55] So as you're trying to do this you're you try bringing your plane in you connect
[01:59:59] But you're not getting the full connection
[02:00:02] And so then i'm going back to the book autopilot coming on he radioed so this is after davis moved in and hooked up
[02:00:08] This is a completely different project. Okay. Yeah, so what project is this one?
[02:00:12] This was
[02:00:15] Using two f-84s two airplanes one on each wing that was going to be the panel right
[02:00:23] And we hadn't gone through the manual flying of it
[02:00:28] and
[02:00:30] Done enough to give them confidence
[02:00:34] to go to an automatic pilot
[02:00:36] And uh, meanwhile i'd been
[02:00:42] Sorry
[02:00:44] I'd been uh
[02:00:47] I'd been there about five years which was
[02:00:51] way more than normal
[02:00:53] and uh
[02:00:56] I wanted to stay there and I told him I say this project's coming up
[02:01:00] Uh, the only other guy that can do it is john davis. He's been flying along but just flying
[02:01:08] I flew the data ship
[02:01:11] That got all the data on you know angles and speeds and
[02:01:16] And john was flying another airplane manually
[02:01:21] Just a standard fighter
[02:01:25] And so I could never get power
[02:01:27] This was something like the fifth
[02:01:32] fifth time
[02:01:34] and
[02:01:37] Everybody was getting nervous, you know, they wanted progress
[02:01:45] Look and the contractor was a low bidder on the autopilot
[02:01:55] um
[02:01:57] And I'm in the Pentagon now. I got a new boss
[02:02:01] And he's pissed off at me because I'm going away flying
[02:02:05] They ask him
[02:02:06] To let me go
[02:02:08] I should have told them a stick it was
[02:02:12] So they didn't they didn't see much
[02:02:15] Desire and keeping me there when I was when I knew this was coming up
[02:02:20] But they want the most experienced guy to make the first few flights and then turn it over to
[02:02:29] Check out some other guys
[02:02:32] and uh
[02:02:35] Now you're you're you're you're coming up on the bad part. Yeah, so
[02:02:41] So basically you had gone in to try and see if you could get it to work
[02:02:45] It didn't work. You didn't get the connection. You didn't get the um
[02:02:48] The power that you were supposed to get when you connected up to the bomber. Yeah, and so you break off
[02:02:56] and then davis comes in and he hooks up
[02:03:00] And and he I'll go to the book now autopilot coming on he radioed and I knew he would be trying to
[02:03:06] Set some kind of record for turning a switch on and off
[02:03:11] And then his airplane
[02:03:12] abruptly pitched up and over and smashed upside down onto the wing of the b29
[02:03:20] I saw the explosive bolts of fire if a certain angle between the wings works was exceeded
[02:03:27] They were to fire automatically blowing the connection apart, but it didn't matter
[02:03:33] It all happened too fast
[02:03:35] the spasm reaction of an autopilot far out of phase through the f84
[02:03:40] Over onto the bomber like the cover of a book slammed shut
[02:03:46] There was no time for anything not even a call on the radio
[02:03:50] The outer panel of the bomber's left wing peeled upward
[02:03:54] From the wingtip almost to the outboard engine and then the f
[02:03:58] f84 fell against the main spar the impact sheared the jets nose away
[02:04:03] Cleanly just in front of the cockpit the fighter bounced off and fell away in a glide
[02:04:09] I remember yelling for john to get out, but I got no response
[02:04:15] The bomber nosed over and with the most
[02:04:18] With most of the wing gone fell into
[02:04:22] big power spiral and augered almost straight in
[02:04:27] It wouldn't have been the simplest thing in the world to get out of pointed almost straight down inspiring
[02:04:32] And spiraling tightly and pressurized which would have made getting a door open even more difficult
[02:04:38] Earlier flights had been flown without pressurizing the cabin guarding against exactly this sort of incident
[02:04:45] But everything had gone so well flight after flight
[02:04:48] That's somewhere along the line the b29 crew had decided such precautions weren't necessary
[02:04:53] In the final seconds just before the bomber crashed into the bay one of the crew of five struggled free
[02:05:02] But he was too low by the by then and there wasn't enough time for his parachute to come all the way open
[02:05:08] Moments later the fighter burrowed into a forest throwing up a huge fireball
[02:05:13] Six men were dead one a close friend because engineers programming the autopilot had erroneously assumed the b29's wing to be rigid
[02:05:26] And because there wasn't an instrument to warn us of
[02:05:29] To warn us how out of phase the autopilot might be
[02:05:33] And because there were too many people involved in the project and because everybody was probably too much in too much of a hurry
[02:05:39] And because no one had fought up computers which probably could have worked out out the settings
[02:05:46] And because of Curtis LeMay had said keep working on it
[02:05:50] And of course because I hadn't said it's too damn tough at a time when saying it was almost certainly would have killed the project
[02:06:00] In war when death is all around a man can steal himself against it block out the heartbreak press on
[02:06:07] But this wasn't wartime and maybe I'd let my guard down
[02:06:12] Maybe of all the things that have happened to me in my life. This probably hit me the hardest
[02:06:19] I was a long time getting over it
[02:06:22] John Davis was dead and it could have been me probably should have been me
[02:06:26] We never did learn why I couldn't draw power from the b29's
[02:06:38] So, um horrible incident
[02:06:43] Yeah, I have to say
[02:06:46] that uh
[02:06:49] In all of my 30 years
[02:06:52] of service
[02:06:54] The hardest thing I had to do
[02:06:58] Was
[02:07:02] Drive back into the housing section
[02:07:06] and tell a
[02:07:09] widow that her husband's not coming back tonight
[02:07:15] I just uh
[02:07:17] I had to do that so many times you'd think I would have coped with it, but
[02:07:25] Somehow rather I just
[02:07:28] Was very difficult for me to do
[02:07:32] Well, there's uh
[02:07:34] You know you talk about this in the book. There's a one point where someone comes comes. There's so many accidents happening
[02:07:40] someone
[02:07:42] comes to do an assessment
[02:07:44] of the
[02:07:45] the program
[02:07:47] And they say there's no evidence of a safety program at edwards like it didn't even exist
[02:07:56] And and actually david and I were talking about this you you eventually got tasked with
[02:08:00] creating a the safety program there
[02:08:03] And david and I were talking about the term buying the farm which everybody knows what buying the farm is
[02:08:08] But I think we found the root of that in your book
[02:08:11] Was that you guys used to say if you if you die then your your widow is going to get a $10,000 insurance policy
[02:08:18] Which is enough to buy the farm or buy whatever you want. So that's where that from from what I know
[02:08:23] That's where that term comes from exactly buying the farm
[02:08:26] but you get tasked with
[02:08:29] coming up with that safety program
[02:08:32] And
[02:08:34] You know you're you're you're at how long are you at that test pilot program for forever. It's a long time. You got
[02:08:42] You got a pretty good story about about uh, yeager in here
[02:08:46] I kind of got to read this one
[02:08:49] Uh, you you're going to again, there's some background and I'm skipping through the book
[02:08:53] So buy the book to get the details chuck was involved in the testing and on one of the flights
[02:08:58] This in late 1963. I was practicing instruments in a t33
[02:09:04] Just happened to be in the air listening on the radio when chucks chase plane had a problem and had to abort
[02:09:10] I piped up and said hey, I'm available
[02:09:13] All a chase pilot does is follow as far as he can and then pick the man up coming back
[02:09:18] And stand by to help if he's needed. So you're out there just doing a normal flight
[02:09:22] Chuck's doing some kind of a test flight and his the person that's supposed to be observing him
[02:09:27] Something happens to his plane. Yeah, so yeah, so you say hey, I'm I'm up here. I got it
[02:09:33] As I circled in the general area where the nf 104 would return to my altitude. I listened and watched
[02:09:40] Chuck made a level run
[02:09:42] Then lifted the 104s nose and touched off its rocket
[02:09:46] Blasting almost straight up leaving a trail that could easily be seen
[02:09:51] At 100,000 feet. I learned later the 104s nose pitched up
[02:09:55] Which was always a danger in the starfighter when you ran out of speed and reached a certain critical angle
[02:10:02] A device made the stick actually shaking your hand to warn you as you approached this angle of attack
[02:10:07] And if you didn't correct then a stick pusher would move the nose down automatically
[02:10:14] Instead of stalling at this angle the 104 would pitch up
[02:10:17] Gyrate around and fall into a spin you could recover from if you had enough altitude
[02:10:22] Only this time the air was too thin for maneuvering and the small thrusters didn't have enough power to force the nose down
[02:10:30] Chuck's plane fell into what became a flat spin
[02:10:33] Bellied down like a frisbee the kind of spin you can almost forget getting out of
[02:10:39] He tried everything to book in the book to recover
[02:10:43] He even popped the landing drag shoot trying to get the nose down with no luck
[02:10:48] I followed him down from 25,000 feet circling his spinning aircraft as we reached 10,000
[02:10:55] I was yelling for him to get out
[02:10:58] He fired the rocket powered ejection seat and while I was calling for the chopper to fly out and get him
[02:11:04] I watched his parachute billo
[02:11:07] I came over low as he landed to see if he was all right
[02:11:11] He was lying down and as I flew by he waved
[02:11:14] The way he was lying seemed awkward, but I wrote that off to the cumbersome spacesuit
[02:11:21] I came by again and he was standing up waving
[02:11:25] I circled until the chopper arrived and took him off to the hospital
[02:11:29] I was stunned to learn he'd been burned
[02:11:32] By the time I got to the hospital his head was swollen as large as a basketball
[02:11:37] As he'd ejected the seat had become fouled in his parachute lines
[02:11:41] And the pull of his shoot popping open had slammed the seat into chuck
[02:11:47] The still hot rocket attached to its underside hit him smack in the face splitting open his helmet his helmet's face plate
[02:11:54] The spent rocket was still spitting some flame and it flashed inside his
[02:11:59] Split helmet fueled by Chuck's oxygen. He managed to get the face plate open which shut off the oxygen or it might have been worse
[02:12:07] As it was his glove caught fire and his face was badly seared
[02:12:12] The doctors had to peel away the skin
[02:12:14] Daily for weeks. It must have hurt like hell. You can still see the scars though. You have to look closely
[02:12:23] So that's a day in the life of the dang fighter test pilots back then
[02:12:31] Uh just kind of crazy stuff you guys were doing
[02:12:34] Well the cold order was still on
[02:12:40] But what he was doing was uh
[02:12:45] Trying to set out a new official
[02:12:51] Speed uh
[02:12:54] Time to climb record and that was especially modified
[02:12:59] Uh F104 that they were going to try to use in the test pilot school. He was
[02:13:08] Running the test pilot school at that time. So
[02:13:12] He was doing some of his own flight testing but
[02:13:18] We had already flown the airplane to 100 and
[02:13:21] 120 something thousand feet and uh
[02:13:30] What space isn't space 50,000 feet the what how how how high up is space?
[02:13:37] I forget what there there is an official
[02:13:40] Yeah, I think it's probably closer to 80 80,000. It's definitely above 50. I've been to 60
[02:13:44] Oh, we're just kind of laughable by these standards. It's not space. Is this the scene is this the scene that they show in the in the book
[02:13:52] Or in the movie the right stuff and in the book the right stuff
[02:13:54] This this scene right here. Are you familiar with that movie the right stuff? Yeah
[02:13:59] Is this what they when they portray?
[02:14:01] Jaeger crashing and he comes walking out of the fire
[02:14:05] And the guy says now, what is that? That's a man
[02:14:08] I forgot that
[02:14:18] So you spend this time out there
[02:14:21] um eventually you get signed
[02:14:24] to the
[02:14:25] In like 1965 you get assigned to the 18th tactical fighter wing. This is an oka now
[02:14:31] Your son meanwhile
[02:14:33] Jim goes to the Air Force Academy. Yeah
[02:14:35] So I guess he was he was following his father's footsteps. How'd you feel about that?
[02:14:42] I was really proud of him. I am proud of him
[02:14:49] He's a real good guy
[02:14:52] That's uh, that's a pretty amazing story. I took him for a ride in uh
[02:14:59] F105 he came to okinawa
[02:15:01] Oh, okay. Wait, how old was he when he went for riding on a 105?
[02:15:08] Oh
[02:15:10] I forget what the academy. Oh, so he was at the academy. Yeah, he was a cadet
[02:15:19] And then of course later on
[02:15:23] He took me on a combat machine
[02:15:25] Okay, well go ahead and tell us that story. I think we already did well. We weren't hit we hadn't hit record yet
[02:15:32] And I was only catching pieces of it because I was getting set up
[02:15:35] So what happened? How'd you end up doing a combat mission with your son in vietnam? Well?
[02:15:41] He when he got out of flying school
[02:15:45] He wanted to go to fighters
[02:15:49] No, I had B 52's, you know
[02:15:52] Long down
[02:15:54] And so he finally decided well if I can't get fighters I might as well go to vietnam
[02:16:02] So he went to a special operation squadron
[02:16:07] This was on the
[02:16:09] choose list
[02:16:12] And flying an old two
[02:16:15] Which is a push puller
[02:16:17] Uh, a Cessna 337
[02:16:22] standard 337 modified for
[02:16:26] special operations and
[02:16:30] Then shortly after he got there I got assigned to talk Lee in thailand
[02:16:38] 105s
[02:16:40] in the sassy Asian war
[02:16:45] and
[02:16:46] The seventh air force was having a all commanders
[02:16:53] Meeting in in Saigon
[02:16:57] And so he'd live he was at benoise so right next door
[02:17:02] So I called him and I said hey, maybe we could get together, you know
[02:17:08] And then he comes back with
[02:17:12] Hey, you want to go into combat mission with me?
[02:17:14] I
[02:17:16] Says you got to be kidding
[02:17:19] You'll never get that permission to do that
[02:17:24] And I certainly would not have permitted it in my wing
[02:17:30] And uh, so he says stand by and on he's a new guy
[02:17:38] And stand by
[02:17:40] And he's gonna come back all it seemed like a minute later. He says it's all set
[02:17:48] He says
[02:17:51] You you come on down to Saigon
[02:17:55] I'll pick you up the next morning
[02:17:58] We'll go on a combat mission land at benoise spend the night
[02:18:03] And then I'll get you back to your
[02:18:05] Your baby, you know Saigon meeting
[02:18:10] So sure enough
[02:18:14] It happens but special operations they do all kinds of stuff and
[02:18:25] So he probably picked a
[02:18:29] Minimum risk kind of a project
[02:18:32] We we went out the
[02:18:38] The
[02:18:42] The O2 had a loud speaker on it
[02:18:47] And they'd go out over communist strongholds and
[02:18:52] Publish a
[02:18:56] Speak
[02:18:58] Most stuff like oh hit him with some psyops some psychological operations. Yeah, that's what I was trying to think
[02:19:05] And then we'd go back over the area and
[02:19:11] Drop leaflets which gave them safe passage
[02:19:16] They could go and you know go up and surrender with it and we would take them up as a
[02:19:23] Personer with no
[02:19:25] Would then kill them. Um
[02:19:31] Well, I'm glad that that approval chain didn't go through your wife because she was not very happy
[02:19:38] I I I carry this story
[02:19:43] I'm a little overkill when I do it, you know
[02:19:47] Oh, you know, I can't I don't have the words I can't describe
[02:19:52] What it means to me to be able to fly with my
[02:19:57] Son in a combat mission. I certainly wouldn't let anybody
[02:20:01] Do it in my organization
[02:20:05] and
[02:20:08] Then I go on I say but my word my wife had a few words to say about it
[02:20:14] She's damn glad she didn't know about it until it was all over
[02:20:17] I
[02:20:20] Um
[02:20:22] Yeah, speaking of like flying with your friends and whatnot
[02:20:26] Uh, you had a little reunion
[02:20:29] In vietnam as well. Here's another one. You got chuck. Yeager chuck said well
[02:20:33] We flew our last combat mission in world war two together. We might as well fly our first combat mission in southeast asia together
[02:20:40] That morning we served as a crew for one of several bombers on a close support mission
[02:20:45] Making one run after another over an endless green jungle
[02:20:49] A forward air controller on the ground with a radio gave us targets
[02:20:53] And we dive in 30 degrees pretty steep for a plane of that size toggle away a single bomb
[02:20:58] Then fly back around and let go another over and over again ever so carefully trying to put them right where the troops wanted them
[02:21:05] Again we stayed the night and partied with friends. So you got to do ops with with Yeager again in vietnam
[02:21:18] Eventually you end up with um
[02:21:22] Eventually you end up with the you become the commander of the 355th tactical fighter wing
[02:21:28] And you're flying the f105
[02:21:30] Uh funder chief which dav told me
[02:21:35] Is is called the thud
[02:21:38] And how'd you like that bird?
[02:21:40] Well, you I don't know what thud means. Oh, okay. Dave gave me some bad intelligence. You didn't call it thud
[02:21:51] Now it got that name from
[02:21:54] crashes
[02:21:56] In the development of the airplane got it and after
[02:22:01] After it was deployed even the first few years
[02:22:05] And I remember when I went to the um
[02:22:09] 18th wing
[02:22:11] They were putting in safety pack 19 and 20 and 21
[02:22:18] God
[02:22:19] It had a terrible reputation, but
[02:22:22] I have to say
[02:22:24] About the 105
[02:22:28] Once we got all the bugs worked out on it
[02:22:31] It was a very reliable airplane
[02:22:36] And it made a good bomber
[02:22:39] You didn't want a dog fight with it except with another 105
[02:22:43] Uh, they called it that fb, you know a fighter bomber
[02:22:54] I flew a tour
[02:22:57] Or a part of a tour in southeast asia with it
[02:23:01] After we'd not quit going north
[02:23:03] We were just bombing the Ho Chi Minh trail. Uh
[02:23:14] You talk about that uh deployment to vietnam
[02:23:18] And what that was like
[02:23:20] Uh, it's I mean we had pretty good air superiority compared compared to when you were fighting the luft wafua over france
[02:23:27] Hey, hell, that's for sure
[02:23:31] Um
[02:23:33] And and eventually your jets get sent home
[02:23:36] Because you had a bad relationship
[02:23:38] If something happened with the tai government because you were in tai land and something what what something went wrong there
[02:23:44] Oh, no, it wasn't um
[02:23:47] It was near the end of the war
[02:23:50] And so they decided to to send the strike thuds, you know the ones making the bombing strikes
[02:23:58] Send one of the groups home
[02:24:03] And unfortunately it it was my group
[02:24:09] I got in a pentagon
[02:24:12] When I left okinawa, I thought
[02:24:16] I'm combat ready in the airplane
[02:24:19] Next logical place is to go to southeast asia, but I'm a bird colonel
[02:24:23] And those assignments are more difficult good good assignments
[02:24:29] Uh
[02:24:31] I said no you're going to the pentagon
[02:24:35] I didn't want to do that
[02:24:38] And I guess my grumblings
[02:24:41] Got down to the colonels assignments somewhere and so
[02:24:45] I got a call he says hey we got a need for a
[02:24:48] Colonel who's been a wing commander who's checked out in the equipment
[02:24:54] Uh and your name flashed out
[02:24:58] I said yeah, that's what I wanted to do when I left okinawa, you know
[02:25:03] And I said well if you want to take it you can take it
[02:25:07] I'll take it
[02:25:09] and uh
[02:25:13] Um
[02:25:15] Then he said well I got to tell you something bad about it
[02:25:19] It may close while you're there
[02:25:22] Maybe shut down good
[02:25:25] Send the wild weasel airplanes home
[02:25:29] No keep them
[02:25:31] And send the strike eagles strike
[02:25:35] Not eagles the fuds strike that's home
[02:25:39] So nobody knew what to do the uh state department said oh you cannot close that wing at this moment
[02:25:51] And uh we went in there with a just a handshake
[02:25:57] We didn't normally when you go into a foreign country
[02:26:02] You have a status of forces agreement
[02:26:05] where they give you example cases like uh one of your truck drivers kills a
[02:26:15] A tie in an accident what do you do?
[02:26:20] And we didn't have any of those
[02:26:22] We went in they ties wanted us in and we we wanted in so we went in
[02:26:30] Anyway, uh
[02:26:32] We got all these things the ties wanted uh
[02:26:36] Everything they wanted everything including the airplane
[02:26:42] But uh when the time came
[02:26:45] We start shutting down
[02:26:48] But still with no uh
[02:26:51] No, uh
[02:26:55] No end date, you know when did we when did we shut down right?
[02:27:00] State department was the was the problem there
[02:27:06] And Christ's ties were still
[02:27:10] Shipping us bombs, you know driving the
[02:27:14] truckloads of bombs
[02:27:16] They go through the tie gate and get the cum shaw, you know
[02:27:22] And they didn't want to turn off the bombs so they're they're bringing them to us
[02:27:28] We're stacking them in the road
[02:27:30] You know the shelters are all filled
[02:27:33] So we're stacking them in the goddamn roads in the
[02:27:37] Jesus just
[02:27:40] You know violation or regulation after regulation
[02:27:44] And uh
[02:27:46] Not having any luck at that
[02:27:49] got a
[02:27:51] Seven to the force
[02:27:54] seventh Air Force
[02:27:56] The assistance team came to visit us
[02:28:00] Help us shut down
[02:28:03] And so I said well, we only need one thing
[02:28:07] Giving a date a shutdown operation
[02:28:10] Well, we can't do that right now
[02:28:14] Well, you could stop the bombs from coming in
[02:28:18] The four star turns to the colonel and he says
[02:28:22] Take care of that
[02:28:24] And we got the bombs shut down
[02:28:27] And I'm still on date
[02:28:31] And uh
[02:28:33] I learned I learned a few things during this period of time
[02:28:38] It was I'm going home to mandatory retirement
[02:28:44] And uh
[02:28:46] I won't tell that story. Let's see
[02:28:55] They offered you a billet and Saigon and you said, nah
[02:28:59] I'm not going to sit around here. I'm a oh after yeah, yeah after they shut it down. Yeah, we're still closing the base down
[02:29:07] Oh, I can tell you that. Okay. I'll tell this to you
[02:29:09] Yeah
[02:29:15] Yeah another meeting but I think it was the same meeting that I went down there to fly with you
[02:29:22] And this
[02:29:24] young brigadier general there was
[02:29:27] in operations
[02:29:30] Was was at this dinner and
[02:29:34] Uh, something came up about me going to the headquarters
[02:29:40] And he pipes up. Yeah, I've got chose you. It'll be good for your career
[02:29:46] So I said in the loudest voice I could
[02:29:50] Gracefully do
[02:29:52] Oh, then you know, I go home to mandatory retirement
[02:29:57] Yeah, really good for my career
[02:30:01] God damn
[02:30:03] So
[02:30:04] You end up going uh, go ahead
[02:30:08] I
[02:30:09] On closing base
[02:30:11] I said, uh
[02:30:13] I took I had seven full kernels
[02:30:16] I said, it's you you
[02:30:18] Close you make a plan to close your function
[02:30:24] You know from day one if I tell you
[02:30:28] How many days?
[02:30:29] weeks whatever
[02:30:31] Does it take you to shut down?
[02:30:36] And so I said every one of you do that and then give it to me
[02:30:40] I put them all together added two months
[02:30:44] and picked the date
[02:30:47] And uh
[02:30:50] Then I decided to put it in a telegram
[02:30:54] To all ships at sea and everybody I could think of
[02:30:58] And state department everybody
[02:31:04] And title
[02:31:07] Closure clothes of
[02:31:10] Closure of tockley plan something like that
[02:31:16] And I sent that thing and then sat back
[02:31:20] And I had no idea what I was going to get
[02:31:24] And oh, oh christ we got a plan
[02:31:27] And it worked like
[02:31:29] It it it like we're like magic. Yeah, we call that leading up the chain of command. We're gonna make this happen
[02:31:37] Jesus christ
[02:31:42] Yeah, everybody was so happy except the
[02:31:44] Except the state department, but I learned a lot of things about
[02:32:01] Waste in government
[02:32:04] So we tried to get rid of everything we had and it
[02:32:09] What didn't we could went into the trash
[02:32:12] And went to the ties
[02:32:17] And
[02:32:20] So
[02:32:23] Oh
[02:32:25] One morning they came and told me hey, we got a dead tie officer in the
[02:32:30] such and such building
[02:32:32] It was one of the buildings we were
[02:32:36] Cleaning up, but we had not turned over to the ties yet
[02:32:40] But
[02:32:42] And he was in there tearing out the electric wire
[02:32:47] Electrocuted himself
[02:32:49] They were you know selling it
[02:32:55] But about about to trash so
[02:33:01] Steel lockers
[02:33:03] Labor intensive to tear up tear down very heavy
[02:33:12] If I tore down
[02:33:15] Torm down
[02:33:17] Shipped him home. Nobody would have said a word, but it would have cost like hell
[02:33:22] But if I put him in the dump
[02:33:25] Aha government waste look at this
[02:33:28] But what we did was
[02:33:33] The
[02:33:35] South Vietnam
[02:33:38] How that created they needed them badly
[02:33:41] So I said well you send somebody over here and dismantle them and get your c-130s
[02:33:49] I got tons of them
[02:33:51] And so we got rid of most of them that way and some of them did make it to the dump, but
[02:33:58] It was a hell of a lot cheaper than
[02:34:00] packing them up and sending them home
[02:34:03] And nobody would complain. There you go. You got to find those solutions. Yeah
[02:34:10] uh
[02:34:11] So you end up
[02:34:13] getting orders
[02:34:15] Back to mcclellan air force base, which is which is about 90 minutes from auburn
[02:34:20] Uh-huh, which is where you're from
[02:34:22] Uh, this was sort of what we call. I don't know if you call in the navy. We call it a twilight tour
[02:34:27] This was sort of your twilight tour. You get put in charge of maintenance. You still get to fly t33. So you're happy about that
[02:34:34] But this is sort of this is where you uh end up your career
[02:34:38] right
[02:34:39] And I'll go to the book here
[02:34:42] You say too soon
[02:34:45] It was over
[02:34:46] There was talk about a big ceremony, but I asked them to forget about that and just mail me my papers
[02:34:52] There was a short sweet ceremony in the commander's office
[02:34:55] Ellie her folks and my mother were there and that was it
[02:35:00] 30 years and 30 days from my day of enlistment at age 50. I was a civilian again
[02:35:06] Going out in the place where it had all begun
[02:35:10] My mother had actually written
[02:35:12] The epitaph for my career a bit earlier when I'd flown home from tokli
[02:35:19] Well, she said when I walked through the door, are you satisfied now?
[02:35:24] I said sure
[02:35:26] file it under white lies
[02:35:32] Because that's you know, you can never be happy never be satisfied
[02:35:36] um
[02:35:37] And that was the end of your career
[02:35:39] In the in the Air Force you ended up working for mcdonald douglas
[02:35:44] Well, they mcdonald aircraft company
[02:35:46] Had them later mcdonald douglas got it. They bought them out
[02:35:52] uh
[02:35:53] It took a few years off from flying, but then you started missing it you started flying again
[02:35:59] Uh, you got some great stories in here is when you got
[02:36:04] A version of old crow back in one of these
[02:36:07] Uh restored
[02:36:09] p-51s you got to fly that you got to fly with jager
[02:36:13] Again in some of these air shows
[02:36:16] um
[02:36:17] Just again the stories as as the book closes out and and how it goes and the rest of the stuff you've done just
[02:36:25] Great just an incredible story incredible story
[02:36:30] How'd you feel that day when you retired?
[02:36:32] I had mixed emotions
[02:36:37] I know so in the seal teams, you know, you have we call it a drying cage, but it's basically a big locker
[02:36:42] Probably the size of a prison cell
[02:36:44] But you have all your gear in there all your gear in there that you collect for the years that you're in and I was in for 20 years
[02:36:51] But I remember my last day. I got my van downstairs
[02:36:56] And I and for me it's kind of similar in that
[02:36:59] 18 out of 20 years. I was stationed in Coronado in San Diego
[02:37:05] All within a hundred yards
[02:37:07] Seal team one
[02:37:09] Seal team three seal team seven when seal team seven was was in an old building right next to seal team one
[02:37:16] And then the training command they're all 100 or 200 yards apart. That's where I spent my whole adult life
[02:37:22] And then one day
[02:37:24] My last day I retired I went up cleaned out my locker
[02:37:27] My last day I retired I went up cleaned out my locker my my gear cage
[02:37:32] Through all that stuff in my van and left
[02:37:36] And that was a pretty empty feeling when I left because you it's your whole life
[02:37:40] Uh, so I'm sure you had some of that when you when you got done. Oh, yeah
[02:37:45] um actually
[02:37:48] Comment was made that by my mother
[02:37:51] was made when I was retired
[02:37:53] And after I was retired she said well you satisfied me up now
[02:38:04] Well, tell you what this is probably a pretty good place to stop. Um
[02:38:08] The book has so much more detailed information in it
[02:38:12] You know, it's just an incredible life
[02:38:15] Incredible hero and I got to read one more quote from the book. You said
[02:38:20] You said all those years
[02:38:22] They'd actually paid me to fly
[02:38:25] What a deal
[02:38:27] It's just uh
[02:38:29] Incredible Dave you got anything else?
[02:38:32] I'm sure you guys could talk for hours. I'm sure you are
[02:38:36] It's this has been
[02:38:38] This has probably been one of the best three hours of honestly of my entire life getting to be here and
[02:38:44] You know, I'm I'm lucky. Um, I get to work with jaco. I'm on this podcast a bunch and I've gotten to meet so many veterans
[02:38:53] And then and then now, you know, this movie top gun just came out again
[02:38:56] And it's so prominent and and people ask me all the time
[02:39:00] You know, what was the first movie like and I saw that I was 13 when the first movie came out
[02:39:04] So as you know at that age when you see something at that young age you look at it and you think man, I really
[02:39:10] Want to do that and a lot of times when people ask me, you know, why'd you become a pilot? I think about that movie a lot but
[02:39:18] As a little kid, you know much before 13 14 I was reading books
[02:39:23] And I remember as a little kid
[02:39:25] Reading a book on on pappy boington and and reading a book on on the black sheep squadron. There's a tv show, you know
[02:39:33] Long before top gun. I was I was already
[02:39:37] I was already enamored
[02:39:39] already enamored and it was it was
[02:39:42] Jaeger
[02:39:44] Anderson
[02:39:45] Foss and boington and what I've realized in this podcast as I'm listening to you talk
[02:39:51] When I was a little kid
[02:39:53] What I wanted to be was you
[02:39:56] I wanted to be you
[02:39:58] And I can't express how much gratitude I feel and how much reflection I have now is a very little boy
[02:40:04] Long before the movie top gun ever came out is what I wanted to be was what you described in this book
[02:40:09] And to get to sit across from you and hear you talk about this
[02:40:13] Is just an honor of of my lifetime and I can look back now and when people ask me why I wanted to be a fighter pilot
[02:40:20] I can tell them that I got to meet the reason why so thank you very much. This has been awesome
[02:40:25] Thank you
[02:40:26] Yeah, I don't have much to say after that, Dave. Um, I got you know
[02:40:31] I
[02:40:34] Get asked
[02:40:37] You know, what do you what do you tell kids today?
[02:40:43] And what I tell kids today is
[02:40:48] You know, you really can be what you want to be and there's a good example of it right there
[02:40:56] If you want to be something
[02:40:58] Really really bad
[02:41:00] You can be it
[02:41:03] and
[02:41:05] I say to kids live your dreams
[02:41:10] And uh
[02:41:13] Find a
[02:41:15] finder something you like to do
[02:41:19] And if you can if your job is something you like to do
[02:41:24] You can excel in that job
[02:41:27] And
[02:41:29] Um
[02:41:32] Live your dreams
[02:41:35] That's that's what I
[02:41:37] Say these days
[02:41:40] Well, sir, uh, you certainly lived your dreams without any doubt and uh, you know people can find you you got a website
[02:41:48] Oh, yeah, same name as the book. It's to fly and fight

[02:41:57] So anybody that's interested in hearing more about you hearing more of your story you can go there and
[02:42:05] Check that out. I mean, it's just uh, it's incredible. It's an honor to be sitting here
[02:42:10] Talking to you and and to have Dave here. Just it's incredible to see
[02:42:15] So thank you so much for for joining us
[02:42:18] And and making the effort to come out here and of course more importantly
[02:42:23] Thank you for your service to our great nation. Thank you for what you did in combat to defend
[02:42:30] The world from tyranny and from darkness
[02:42:34] And to defend freedom in the world
[02:42:37] You fought
[02:42:39] You fought
[02:42:41] machine against machine
[02:42:43] And you fought man against man
[02:42:45] In the ultimate test of skill
[02:42:48] And you won every time
[02:42:50] And and that's pretty impressive
[02:42:53] And we salute you and we thank you for your service, sir. Thank you very much
[02:43:00] And with that bud Anderson has left the building
[02:43:07] Dave I feel like I was just turning over to you at this time
[02:43:09] I don't know if that's a good idea man
[02:43:11] I I need a little time to decompress and kind of contemplate that that was um, I knew that was going to be a unique experience for me, but that was
[02:43:20] I don't have a lot of frame of reference to what to compare that to that was and that was unreal for me man
[02:43:25] When he just stepped up you were kind of rattling off some of the thoughts that you had in your head
[02:43:31] As you were thinking about this
[02:43:33] And you're thinking
[02:43:35] for instance
[02:43:37] A thousand aircraft go out
[02:43:39] and
[02:43:41] whatever six hours later
[02:43:45] Ten percent of those are gone a hundred aircraft crews gone
[02:43:53] This is what they did day after day after day after day, yeah
[02:43:58] There's like I don't know is there anything equivalent for a fighter pilot to being a world war two fighter pilot
[02:44:05] Look the guys in vietnam, obviously they extremely challenging
[02:44:08] Uh, you know, uh
[02:44:10] horrible situations to go and go and into you know having
[02:44:14] Guys like charlie plum and william reeter on on the podcast to talk about their experiences
[02:44:20] you know
[02:44:22] Surface to air missiles migs out there
[02:44:25] Uh, those encounters were
[02:44:28] relatively rare
[02:44:30] Compared to you're going to bomb germany. You are 100 percent
[02:44:35] 100 percent gonna get into it. Yeah, this is the next level. Yeah, I don't think from scale like there's nothing
[02:44:44] He's talking about
[02:44:45] Was it big week? Is that what they called it big week? Yeah first mission thousand bombers 800 fighters and 16
[02:44:52] 160 germans come up to fight them something like that. So there's 2 000 airplanes in the sky
[02:44:57] and
[02:44:58] 250 bombers don't come home
[02:45:00] I don't think there's anything certainly in my aviation mind that's even close to the scale of that
[02:45:06] It's just it's hard even for me. It's really hard to relate to what that might look like. It's kind of overwhelming
[02:45:12] the heavies
[02:45:14] dude
[02:45:15] Hey, by the way, they just mentioned this if you want to get the book to fly and fight
[02:45:20] go to go to this website. I already mentioned to fly and fight.com
[02:45:24] and
[02:45:26] bud is signing books so you can get a signed book
[02:45:30] from that website and
[02:45:33] I would recommend you do it. I mean this guy's a hundred years old right now
[02:45:36] Just he the stuff that he's seen in his life lucky to be here
[02:45:40] um, just awesome
[02:45:42] So if you get the chance and the book by the way, I I read through two dog fights
[02:45:49] So there's whatever 14 more and they all have their own little details
[02:45:54] They all have their own little scenarios that are happening and and look the rest of the book
[02:45:57] There's all kinds of things in there that we didn't talk about
[02:46:00] So if you want to hear that story
[02:46:02] Go get that book to fly and fight.com
[02:46:06] We may have to like once this comes out actually when you listen to this again
[02:46:10] Take notes and maybe we'll do sort of a
[02:46:13] A wrap up of this and you can kind of talk through some of the stuff and maybe even bring in some stuff
[02:46:18] Different stuff from the book if we didn't cover it because I mean you're talking about
[02:46:21] Them shooting down German
[02:46:24] German pilots that were parachuting and that was just there's a bunch of other things to talk about that we didn't cover here
[02:46:31] So when you listen to this take notes and maybe we'll do another sort of a recap
[02:46:36] Or an after-actions on this even if it's just like, you know
[02:46:39] An hour or four or whatever
[02:46:42] Right on we can go through it
[02:46:44] Echo Charles you've been here the whole time, but you've been quiet. Yes because you've been uh, you didn't have a mic
[02:46:48] Yes, so on purpose. What you know, let's face it. What am I gonna add to well then again? I did kind of have some there
[02:46:57] That first dog fight
[02:46:59] You know what wait the first one or the one the first one that you read one that he said luck you shot
[02:47:05] Yeah, yeah, so I I was
[02:47:08] So a lot of people say like oh you should read my audiobook or whatever
[02:47:12] But that was the first time where I was like you should read this audiobook
[02:47:15] You meaning him or you meaning me you okay? So because and of course the story's laid out like perfect
[02:47:21] Right, especially at the end. I don't know why I like the end so much when he was like
[02:47:24] Oh, I don't even know if that was my shot
[02:47:25] It might have been the other guy shot, you know, and I don't even know how to approach this guy
[02:47:28] And then when he found out it was his that was good
[02:47:33] Yeah, you know, I didn't I actually didn't read that part so he could kind of tell the story
[02:47:36] And it's a weird thing to try and figure like what do you want to read and what do you want to hear from them?
[02:47:40] You know and you got about I mean in my mind. I'm always trying to think like I want to give them enough that they go
[02:47:45] Oh, yeah, and they get in the zone and then they kind of fill in the deets as they say
[02:47:51] But man, you know, it's such an honor to be able to have these guys on and
[02:47:56] Hear their stories man. It's just
[02:47:59] It's crazy and then you know, you always have to think to yourself
[02:48:02] that there's almost 300,000
[02:48:05] That didn't come home from this war and that didn't get to tell their story and didn't get to have kids
[02:48:11] um, yeah, it's just
[02:48:14] So we're so lucky to be able to to have this opportunity to do this so
[02:48:20] Appreciate y'all listening and and if you want to support what we're doing here
[02:48:24] And you want to support yourself too, which is a bonus. It's true
[02:48:27] Some people might even prioritize supporting yourself over supporting what we're doing here
[02:48:31] Either way, it's a win because if you support yourself good
[02:48:34] We I want you to be stronger and smarter and faster and better
[02:48:37] Yeah, it's for one of the functions of this the existence of this whole outfit. I think yeah
[02:48:43] So if you want that you can go if you want to support you want to support yourself
[02:48:47] You want to support america by the way you can see I kind of got a little fired up when we started talking about the p51 Mustang
[02:48:54] The p51 Mustang was like the it was a game changer a game changer
[02:48:59] 500 miles an hour. It's just faster and stronger and better and it was american made
[02:49:07] it was american made and and
[02:49:09] Obviously it was american made
[02:49:11] But just think of like every detail that the engineering the design the material like all that went into that and that that
[02:49:18] That wasn't even an idea on december 7th 1941. That wasn't even an idea. They're just like, okay, cool
[02:49:23] We have to build the bet you think well, I actually don't know the history wasn't an idea yet
[02:49:27] I
[02:49:28] Don't know exactly the development of it. They knew we knew we needed better airplanes
[02:49:33] But I don't think anybody certainly in 1941 it could have predicted what the Mustang was going to be
[02:49:39] Other than we needed something
[02:49:41] Well, I was so fired up listening to talk about the Mustang that I started thinking about the Ford Mustang
[02:49:45] Like I just need to get a Ford Mustang because I can't get a Mustang Mustang
[02:49:49] I can't get a p51 Mustang, but I get a Ford Mustang
[02:49:52] That's an american made piece of machinine legit legit
[02:49:55] That's how fired up. I was getting talking about this aircraft
[02:50:00] and uh, what they did with it so
[02:50:04] America she wants some american made stuff well for hey jockel fuel got jockel fuel.com go get some stuff
[02:50:10] Hey jockel fuel. We got all new flavors. I was pounded mine today. Were you pounding yours today, Dave?
[02:50:13] How's that new orange? It's so good. Do you think your orange could be better?
[02:50:16] I didn't know that it could be better. No, but I know that it's like the p51 Mustang of freaking drinks
[02:50:21] It's the upgrade. It's like the new version of the Mustang. It's a little bit better. It's a little bit better
[02:50:27] And echo Charles, how are you over there on the mango?
[02:50:30] Actually, I got messages saying that that's their new favorite flavor. Oh, so you got people that the mango comes through more
[02:50:37] So their old favorite flavor was mango and their new favorite flavors mango. Is that what you're saying?
[02:50:42] Their old favorite flavor apparently was not mango
[02:50:45] Just guessing what the last one was nonetheless. Yeah, they're all they're all a lot better
[02:50:49] They're all a lot better. They're different. They're they're in a different category. So jockel fuel.com get yourself some milk
[02:50:55] Get yourself some joint warfare some krill super krill
[02:50:59] uh origin usa's look made in america is a thing and peep like you know like bud anderson said people like
[02:51:05] Oh, we can't make the stuff over here. I laugh at them
[02:51:09] That's what p roberts did when they said hey, you can't make gays in america. He laughed at them
[02:51:13] Because guess what we can we have the capability we have the technology we have the skill set we have the will
[02:51:19] To get it done
[02:51:21] And look you can go buy your you can go buy your your genes. Let's say
[02:51:25] From a place that is literally has slaves
[02:51:30] You can that's what you can do or you can buy it from america
[02:51:33] Where we're on board with freedom
[02:51:37] With freedom that's what's happening
[02:51:39] And they happen to be the best genes that I own
[02:51:44] 51 of
[02:51:46] You know what I think the next the next modification the next modification or the next version of the genes
[02:51:51] I don't even know what they might we might do but
[02:51:54] There's going to be some p 51 things coming out. Yeah
[02:51:58] And look I get it p 38 love it
[02:52:01] Uh corsair love it. You probably love the corsair a lot. I do because you because that's marine core
[02:52:05] Or wait, what's your is that your favorite bird world war two when I grow up happy boynton black sheep
[02:52:11] Marine core corsairs win in the war in the pacific. Yes. Listen the p 51
[02:52:17] Is the iconic world war two fighter and everybody knows it that doesn't mean I don't love the corsair
[02:52:22] All the marines out there know what's up, but listen the p 51. That's the machine that won the war in europe
[02:52:26] Everybody knows it bro
[02:52:27] Sometimes the the p 51 flies like in the vicinity of my house because they'll do the coastal runs

[02:57:38] And I just think I just my life
[02:57:41] Every podcast should just be about another section of about face
[02:57:45] There's so many things in there. It's so filled with goodness
[02:57:49] That you miss goodness
[02:57:52] Right, it's like you walk into a buffet and maybe over in a corner. There's like some some uh
[02:57:56] Uh, some little wagyu beef like
[02:58:00] Nibblets, right?
[02:58:01] Hell yeah, but there's prime rib over there. There's some you know some bacon wrapped hot dogs over
[02:58:05] This is like a bunch of stuff. You miss the nibblets, bro
[02:58:08] Well, I know more room on your plate kind either that or just overwhelmed with goodness. Yeah, there's goodness everywhere
[02:58:13] Maybe they got some mulk like in the containers. You ready to drink, you know, we got ready to drink mulk coming
[02:58:19] R.T.D. as they said
[02:58:21] I was worried not worried you you you you you you
[02:58:25] You want to control your expectations, right? You want to be like look, it's going to be healthy. There's no sugar
[02:58:31] Like you know, how can it it's going to be it'll be good, but how good
[02:58:36] Dude, it's
[02:58:38] Gtg as we say. Yes. It's good to go. E.A.E.
[02:58:42] Yeah, all this
[02:58:44] It's it's delicious. Yeah, I was comparing it. I will I wanted it to taste as good as a certain
[02:58:51] Um, let's say known well-known brand of chocolate flavored drink. We'll say we're there
[02:58:59] We're there. All right, that's good. That's good. Yeah, that's interesting. It's outstanding
[02:59:03] You imagine drinking something that is completely good for you and it tastes delicious
[02:59:07] I don't even have to imagine anymore. Oh, yeah, and and I said this from the beginning
[02:59:12] Where my kids like the the you know, there's word kid mokkawara. They like the regular one like the best
[02:59:17] They think that's like a treat and I kind of psychologically like train them to know that that's like the treat or whatever
[02:59:24] But yeah, and so I know I do a guilt-free, you know
[02:59:28] There's something that you can do that tastes so has so much goodness so much
[02:59:32] So much immediate gratification and no downside
[02:59:37] Short and long-term pain. Yeah, that's kind of a
[02:59:40] I guess you could look at jocco fuel from a strategic perspective and one of the consistent
[02:59:48] underlying themes of the
[02:59:51] products is
[02:59:53] Short-term mega gratification taste wise and long-term total goodness across the board health wise. Yeah
[03:00:01] That's a thing. It's an anomaly people people don't know what's up with that. It's kind of hard to believe in a lot of ways
[03:00:07] Yeah, wait a second as Dave said earlier today. What I should say is you're welcome
[03:00:14] Dave's like jocco. You just need to tell people. Oh, here's my drink. You're welcome
[03:00:19] Oh, here's mokk. You're welcome. He was not wrong with that. Here's joint warfare taken
[03:00:24] You're gonna be able to do things you couldn't do two weeks ago. You're welcome. Oh, but then again, I don't know joint warfare is pills
[03:00:30] I know but you're welcome. Yeah
[03:00:33] For sure that but yeah, okay. Yeah, the short term that's it
[03:00:35] That's like what do you call it? What do you call when it's like normal?
[03:00:38] You know something that you don't love but it's like the standard so whatever shut it down echo. Good work
[03:00:44] Thanks, man. Do you got any other cool things I'm saying that you want to kill? I'm keeping it. What do you call?
[03:00:49] Real like down to earth like for you know, you see him saying nice job
[03:00:53] Appreciate it. Okay. Let's just end this freaking echo screwed up. What are you talking about?
[03:00:58] It's all true. We're just riding this huge wave and you're like, yeah, but those are pills
[03:01:01] Okay, you know what we need to do we're gonna make some chewable
[03:01:06] Oh, see right now you're talking that have a really good like lemon lime sort of zing to it tasting good
[03:01:12] Okay, remember back in the day old school
[03:01:16] Remember those vitamin c wafer 100 things. Okay. See now we're talking this is those vitamin c wafers is is how you end up with
[03:01:25] 3,500
[03:01:27] milligrams
[03:01:29] Of vitamin c in your day. Oh, yeah colds are running away from you
[03:01:34] And they they taste it kind of like like a special candy 100% you know, oh, yeah, see so that's like the
[03:01:40] The avenue to pursue as far as pills go. I don't mean pills. You know what but let's face it

[03:06:22] And one of the students asks something like what is the hardest thing?
[03:06:28] about being a pilot
[03:06:30] And without hesitation he replies
[03:06:34] losing friends
[03:06:37] And we get to read this book and we get to hear about the life and experiences of bud anderson
