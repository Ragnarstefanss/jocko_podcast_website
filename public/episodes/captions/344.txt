[00:00:00] This is Jocko podcast number 344 with Echo Charles and me,
[00:00:03] Jocko willing, good evening Echo.
[00:00:05] Good evening.
[00:00:06] Also joining us tonight, Dean Lister.
[00:00:08] Good evening.
[00:00:09] Good evening Dean.
[00:00:10] Dean Lister from podcast 137, if you haven't heard that,
[00:00:14] go listen to it, Dean is,
[00:00:17] is it safe to say Dean's one of the greatest grapplers
[00:00:18] of all time?
[00:00:20] I have to ask Echo Charles.
[00:00:21] Is it safe to say that?
[00:00:22] It is safe to say yes.
[00:00:24] Like Jiu Jitsu world champion, is that accurate?
[00:00:28] Yeah, Abu Dhabi was like the hardest tournament.
[00:00:31] Submission.
[00:00:32] I won it three times, two times.
[00:00:34] Super fights, absolute in my division.
[00:00:36] So I guess, I don't know, best, it's always relative.
[00:00:39] Well, we could at least at a minimum,
[00:00:41] we could say he's a good grappler.
[00:00:42] Yes sir.
[00:00:43] It's safe to say he's a good grappler.
[00:00:44] I agree with that.
[00:00:45] Definitely, a few good days, a few good days here.
[00:00:47] So good evening, Dean.
[00:00:50] You know, you fought in a bunch of stuff.
[00:00:52] Fought in a pride over in Japan, fought in UFC.
[00:00:55] And I thought it would be cool to bring you on
[00:00:57] because we got some stuff to talk about.
[00:01:01] Speaking of the UFC.
[00:01:03] So the UFC kind of changed everything for martial arts.
[00:01:10] And really, I guess you go back to like Valley Tudo
[00:01:13] in Brazil and NHB in Brazil.
[00:01:16] But that type of unrestricted fighting,
[00:01:20] advanced martial arts in a decade or two,
[00:01:25] more than it had advanced,
[00:01:30] in a very long time.
[00:01:33] But you know, I was thinking about that.
[00:01:34] I was thinking about what you just said.
[00:01:35] And I actually think that's actually not true a little bit.
[00:01:37] And here's why.
[00:01:38] I think it actually brought it back to reality.
[00:01:42] Because if you went back to ancient Greece
[00:01:45] and looked at paint creation, right,
[00:01:48] those guys and we have images of people doing paint creation.
[00:01:51] Oh, blotters.
[00:01:52] And they're doing them a plotters,
[00:01:53] they're doing cameras, they're doing,
[00:01:54] they're doing heel hooks, they're doing what we do.
[00:01:57] And paint creation, if you don't know what it is,
[00:01:59] it was in the Olympics.
[00:02:01] And I'm talking the old school Olympics.
[00:02:03] I'm talking 648 BC is when paint creation
[00:02:07] was introduced into the Olympics.
[00:02:08] And it was a combination of wrestling, boxing, kicking,
[00:02:11] joint locks, chokes.
[00:02:12] It was, in other words, an ancient version of MMA.
[00:02:16] But over time, over time, things got separated.
[00:02:21] The disciplines got separated into boxing over here,
[00:02:26] wrestling over here, Muay Thai over here,
[00:02:28] Jiu Jitsu over here, Judo over here,
[00:02:30] Taekwondo over here, karate over here.
[00:02:33] And I was trying to think about why that happened.
[00:02:36] And I actually think I have a suspicion, we'll say.
[00:02:40] A hypothesis.
[00:02:41] My hypothesis is, you know how people generally
[00:02:47] only want to do what they're good at?
[00:02:49] Like, oh, you're good at,
[00:02:51] bench press, what are we doing for a workout today?
[00:02:54] We're doing bench press.
[00:02:55] Or oh, you're good at squats, what do you wanna do?
[00:02:57] Oh, we're gonna do squats.
[00:02:59] Oh, you're good at grappling other people.
[00:03:03] So you don't want, I don't want, you know,
[00:03:05] I'm good at boxing, I don't want Dean Lister grabbing hold
[00:03:08] of me and taking me to the ground.
[00:03:09] And I don't, so I'm gonna make a different thing.
[00:03:11] Something that I'm good at.
[00:03:13] And that starts to draw in all the people
[00:03:14] that are good at that thing.
[00:03:17] Yeah.
[00:03:18] And over time, it seems like you just have these
[00:03:21] separate things.
[00:03:22] Now, whether that's the actual reason, I don't know.
[00:03:25] But everything got separated.
[00:03:30] And martial arts became siloed, right?
[00:03:34] Whereas just different sections.
[00:03:37] And then unfortunately,
[00:03:41] martial arts became theoretical.
[00:03:46] And it didn't take much time for it to go from theory
[00:03:51] to lies.
[00:03:53] And I know lies is a strong word, but if you go look at,
[00:03:59] what's the Instagram?
[00:04:01] McDogelLife.
[00:04:02] If you go look at McDogel, those are lies.
[00:04:05] That dude posts, what's his name?
[00:04:08] McDogelLife.
[00:04:09] McDogelLife.
[00:04:10] So if you go to McDogelLife, you can see people
[00:04:13] are teaching lies, actual lies to other people.
[00:04:17] And the lies are things like, oh, this one strike.
[00:04:22] Or my chi will prevent me from being taken down.
[00:04:26] Or I can absorb your strikes with my aura.
[00:04:29] Yeah.
[00:04:30] Jacques, do you think that's,
[00:04:32] you think it's a form of, I don't wanna say,
[00:04:34] hypnosis, but what is it you think?
[00:04:36] Like that kind of, is it like, oh, everyone else is doing it.
[00:04:38] So I guess I'll do it, I'll play along.
[00:04:40] Or is it, do they actually?
[00:04:41] There's absolutely some kind of psychological,
[00:04:44] there's a psychological phenomenon that occurs.
[00:04:46] Isn't he making a movie about this?
[00:04:48] Yeah.
[00:04:49] To explain it.
[00:04:50] Yeah, like a bit documentary, yeah.
[00:04:51] To explain, and I'm sure there's-
[00:04:52] I'll be in that movie.
[00:04:54] That's awesome.
[00:04:54] You in it too, Echo Charles?
[00:04:56] No.
[00:04:57] Okay.
[00:04:58] So McDogelLife is making a movie about it,
[00:05:00] but yeah, there's some kind of psychological manipulation
[00:05:04] that happens where, oh, you point your finger at my sternum
[00:05:09] and I feel like pain and fall down.
[00:05:12] And the reason we know it's a lie is
[00:05:15] cause plenty of people have challenged like,
[00:05:16] oh, try that on me.
[00:05:18] Mother liquor.
[00:05:18] Charles, what's the story about you?
[00:05:20] You were at, I don't know about the seal base,
[00:05:22] but you were there and someone was like, yeah,
[00:05:23] you know, you put your finger in the collarbone
[00:05:26] and you're like, no.
[00:05:27] And he's like, yeah, it works.
[00:05:28] And he said, try it on me.
[00:05:29] And you double-edit him or something.
[00:05:31] What was the story?
[00:05:31] No, well, I had a guy saying that,
[00:05:34] like they had a name for this like neck strike.
[00:05:37] And they were like, oh, if this is done,
[00:05:40] like if I did this for real,
[00:05:42] you'd immediately be like paralyzed
[00:05:44] on the right side of your body
[00:05:45] and that would cause you to fall down.
[00:05:47] And then that would lead to my next move,
[00:05:49] which is like, he'll stop to the collar or whatever.
[00:05:50] Right?
[00:05:51] And so I was like, cool, do it to me.
[00:05:55] He's like, no.
[00:05:55] And the guy's like, well, no, it's, you know,
[00:05:56] and I was like, do it to me, just do it.
[00:05:59] And it didn't, it didn't, obviously it didn't work.
[00:06:01] Like a karate chop to the neck.
[00:06:03] But didn't you take one, like second one?
[00:06:05] And the third one he responded, heard that you were,
[00:06:07] you know, I don't even think I retaliated.
[00:06:09] The word is that the word that was a thug.
[00:06:10] No, Jeff Higgs had a guy that said
[00:06:13] that he couldn't be taken down
[00:06:15] once he settled his chi.
[00:06:17] He could root into the ground.
[00:06:18] Yeah, he would root into the ground.
[00:06:20] And he, the guy's like,
[00:06:21] you would not be able to take me down.
[00:06:23] And Higgs is, you know, what do you mean?
[00:06:25] And Higgs, if you don't know who he is,
[00:06:26] he's been on the podcast.
[00:06:27] He's a black belt in jiu-jitsu.
[00:06:28] He's a former seal and a good friend of all of ours.
[00:06:32] But this guy was saying, oh, you can't take me down
[00:06:35] once I settle my chi.
[00:06:36] I was, I was, remember that's a good quote, right?
[00:06:39] Once I settle my chi.
[00:06:40] Cause it sounds like it might be a legitimate thing, right?
[00:06:43] Like that's like, you just didn't make that up.
[00:06:44] That's, you've told that to other people.
[00:06:47] And so Jeff's like, okay, well,
[00:06:49] why don't you go ahead and settle that chi?
[00:06:52] And the guy goes through his little ceremonial thing
[00:06:54] and like, you know, gets in the horse stance.
[00:06:58] And Higgs is like, are you ready?
[00:06:59] He's like, yeah.
[00:07:00] And Jeff just like double legs
[00:07:01] and slams it on the ground.
[00:07:02] My toes were crossed.
[00:07:04] Yeah.
[00:07:05] She wasn't settled.
[00:07:06] So there is some, when you get to that kind of
[00:07:08] McDowjo stuff, there's definitely some psychological
[00:07:11] weirdness that's going on.
[00:07:13] But those lies were spread.
[00:07:16] And you know, whether it was, you can't,
[00:07:18] you can't strike through my aura or the dimock,
[00:07:22] which is, hey, if I touch you here,
[00:07:24] you're going to literally die.
[00:07:25] It's right a few days later.
[00:07:27] Which also leads to the, hey, I can't actually do this to you
[00:07:30] because I don't want to kill you and go to jail for murder.
[00:07:33] Okay.
[00:07:34] I would do it to you because you're making me mad,
[00:07:36] but I don't want to go to jail for murder.
[00:07:37] So I'm not going to do this, you know, dimock to you.
[00:07:41] Yeah.
[00:07:41] And furthermore, you know, the reason you don't see these
[00:07:44] moves in competition because they're not allowed.
[00:07:47] Jocko, in times as a UFC fighter,
[00:07:49] if I had guys come to me and go,
[00:07:50] hey, you know, I saw your fight, you're a good fighter.
[00:07:53] You know, I'm a street fighter, Joe.
[00:07:54] You know, I'm like, okay.
[00:07:55] But they had to like qualify that for some reason to me.
[00:07:58] I'm like, well, you know, okay, that's cool.
[00:08:00] You know, it's just kind of funny that someone thinks
[00:08:03] that maybe I've never been in a real life altercation
[00:08:06] outside, you know, also like, like I've had my,
[00:08:09] that's why I look special in my face.
[00:08:11] I've been bit, I've been poked and whatever
[00:08:14] and the rest you can imagine.
[00:08:15] But it's like, yeah, those things I would call them targets
[00:08:18] of opportunity or fighting dirty,
[00:08:20] but you can't replicate the eye gouge over and over
[00:08:22] or you're going to have everyone's got one eye, you know.
[00:08:24] So, so I don't know.
[00:08:25] I just think it's funny that people think that
[00:08:28] despite all your training, if it's a street fight,
[00:08:30] like you have no chance.
[00:08:31] I don't know, man, whatever.
[00:08:33] If you could do an experiment where you took someone
[00:08:35] and just train them in Jiu Jitsu
[00:08:38] and they never got in a street fight
[00:08:41] and they went against someone that was a street fighter
[00:08:45] in the street, it's like it doesn't matter.
[00:08:49] Yeah, so the training will transfer now, look,
[00:08:54] could you pick up some bad habits
[00:08:56] where you do something in the street
[00:08:58] that now it takes you an extra two seconds to win
[00:09:01] because you should have done this specific thing
[00:09:04] because yeah, you could do that.
[00:09:05] But that's like the tiniest percentage.
[00:09:10] If there's someone that's like, that's why I don't train,
[00:09:12] you know, because I'm ready for the street.
[00:09:18] But going back to the storyline a little bit,
[00:09:20] these lies, which still exist today,
[00:09:24] in the 70s and 80s, these lies were just kind of like
[00:09:27] out of control and they definitely got picked up
[00:09:31] in the military.
[00:09:33] I was looking through some old army,
[00:09:35] I looked through an old army hand-to-hand manual from 1982.
[00:09:38] So this is like in the heyday of Chi.
[00:09:42] And it said this in this manual, no judo.
[00:09:46] You have probably already asked yourself,
[00:09:48] what about throwing and takedowns like in judo?
[00:09:51] We have purposely excluded throws and takedowns
[00:09:55] because throws and takedowns are normally only
[00:09:58] an intermediate step to taking your opponent out.
[00:10:02] After your opponent is thrown to the ground,
[00:10:04] you will probably still have to strike him to finish him.
[00:10:06] So let's just block his attack and finish him
[00:10:09] with counter strikes instead of blocking,
[00:10:11] throwing, then striking.
[00:10:14] It's like, that actually makes you think,
[00:10:18] well, you know, it's a good point.
[00:10:20] You know, that's a good point.
[00:10:21] You know, I'm not gonna, I don't wanna have to take someone
[00:10:23] down, I'll just take them out.
[00:10:26] This thing goes on to say that throwing
[00:10:28] puts you in a vulnerable position.
[00:10:29] To throw your opponent, you must first grab him.
[00:10:31] This puts you close to your opponent
[00:10:33] and vulnerable to his attack.
[00:10:34] Certain throws, yeah, certain throws.
[00:10:36] Oh, for sure.
[00:10:38] Well, theoretical, again, that's the problem
[00:10:40] with this stuff is theoretically,
[00:10:42] especially if I say, listen, Dean,
[00:10:44] if I, you know, double knuckle punch your sternum,
[00:10:48] it's gonna cause you to have a cardiac arrest.
[00:10:50] So why am I gonna bother throwing you
[00:10:52] and I can just give you a literal heart attack?
[00:10:55] And you, and if you said, well, why don't you show me that?
[00:10:58] I'd be like, cause I don't wanna kill you, bro.
[00:11:00] You just have to, but trust me.
[00:11:04] So, actually what's interesting is in that book
[00:11:08] that Fieldman, who I was looking at,
[00:11:11] you know, I'm looking at the rest of it
[00:11:12] and it has all these like, their foot patterns
[00:11:17] and it looks like these dance moves to like avoid
[00:11:20] and like strengthen your power.
[00:11:22] And it's just a bunch of nonsense,
[00:11:24] to be honest with you.
[00:11:25] But like I just said, if this stuff is getting taught
[00:11:27] by some authoritarian figure
[00:11:30] and you can't really test it in any way,
[00:11:34] and you know, this is someone that's a, you know,
[00:11:37] a 38 year old who's talking to an 18 year old recruit
[00:11:42] that kind of wants to believe, by the way.
[00:11:44] Cause most people are like,
[00:11:45] oh, you're giving me a special power,
[00:11:47] I'm gonna take it.
[00:11:48] I'm not gonna question you.
[00:11:49] And that's probably what leads to some of the
[00:11:52] weird McDow-Joe life type scenarios.
[00:11:58] So this, to me, this is like the low point
[00:12:01] of martial arts in history, in my opinion.
[00:12:04] This is the 1970s, the 1980s.
[00:12:06] And look, I get it.
[00:12:06] Some guys were doing the best they could
[00:12:08] with what was available and good on them.
[00:12:11] I know some of those guys.
[00:12:13] Remember Dr. Mick?
[00:12:14] Dr. Mick was one of those guys.
[00:12:15] And he had a whole crew of guys.
[00:12:16] Like in the 70s, they did everything they could
[00:12:18] to the extent that they could do it.
[00:12:21] And there was also some guys that were awesome back then.
[00:12:22] Judo Jean LaBelle.
[00:12:25] Like no one can question the effectiveness
[00:12:30] and the efficiency and the awesomeness
[00:12:32] of Judo Jean LaBelle, 50, 60, 70s.
[00:12:36] But as a whole, if you look at commercially,
[00:12:41] that time period was pretty rough for martial arts.
[00:12:44] And then the UFC came.
[00:12:47] And the UFC brought the truth.
[00:12:49] And with that, everything changed for the better.
[00:12:54] I'm taking notes by the way.
[00:12:55] This is good stuff.
[00:12:57] Everything changed for the better.
[00:13:00] What's your notes?
[00:13:01] Do you have any so far?
[00:13:02] Well, I wrote a few things down.
[00:13:03] I just think we'll get into this,
[00:13:05] but it's old saying and I'll butcher it probably,
[00:13:07] but oh, there we go.
[00:13:10] Something like hard work achieved without payment
[00:13:14] or without sacrifice is something you shouldn't trust.
[00:13:17] So the quick way to get this quick knockout
[00:13:20] without learning how to box,
[00:13:22] or the quick way to get the flying submission
[00:13:24] or the stimulus to go on that break
[00:13:26] without learning to grapple,
[00:13:28] it seems good, but it doesn't work.
[00:13:31] Trying to get in shape without working out.
[00:13:34] You just get implants in your biceps like you.
[00:13:37] Sure.
[00:13:38] You have bicep implants.
[00:13:39] Those arms don't work exactly.
[00:13:41] Sorry, I won't say it on the internet.
[00:13:45] That's private.
[00:13:46] But these kind of things, these shortcuts,
[00:13:49] become a millionaire tomorrow
[00:13:51] without even having a business plan.
[00:13:53] I'm saying that's an interesting idea.
[00:13:55] So it sounds good.
[00:13:56] And I think if someone trained a lot in boxing,
[00:13:58] kickboxing and wrestling,
[00:14:00] you could do that stuff
[00:14:01] if you train in all these disciplines.
[00:14:03] I think it's interesting.
[00:14:05] That is something that I think it's imperative
[00:14:07] to get into.
[00:14:09] I asked you this, Jaco.
[00:14:11] It relates to what we're talking about right now.
[00:14:13] I had a Zoom call with like 12 Marine officers.
[00:14:17] They called me, it was a colonel.
[00:14:19] They called me their, I don't know,
[00:14:21] captains and lieutenants.
[00:14:22] And they were talking about,
[00:14:23] because they had fought,
[00:14:24] I guess they saw me compete in Brazil,
[00:14:26] talking about my training patterns and whatever.
[00:14:29] And they were saying,
[00:14:30] how it can relate to the military.
[00:14:32] And I said, well,
[00:14:33] and this is something I know,
[00:14:34] it's stepping out a little out of my realm,
[00:14:36] but I mentioned something,
[00:14:38] simulation training, of course, you talk about that.
[00:14:40] And that's not combat,
[00:14:41] but that's closer to combat
[00:14:42] than bang, bang, bang, you know?
[00:14:44] And I know the argument,
[00:14:46] they don't go through walls and are as realistic,
[00:14:47] but you get a sting, you got hit.
[00:14:50] And they were like, no, there's,
[00:14:51] yeah, that's closer to a gun battle
[00:14:54] than laser tag or something like that.
[00:14:56] What's the old system that would beat?
[00:14:58] Yeah, there's an old system called Miles Gear,
[00:15:00] which is a laser tag system.
[00:15:01] And they have more advanced laser systems,
[00:15:03] which are actually really good now.
[00:15:05] And yes, that's a very,
[00:15:07] those are great training tools.
[00:15:08] And sure, are there some little things
[00:15:11] about using those systems that are not accurate?
[00:15:14] Yes, but just as you said, it's closer.
[00:15:17] So if you're getting ready for,
[00:15:18] I don't even know life in that situation,
[00:15:20] I would rather trust the person who has trained 10 years
[00:15:23] in a struggle where they've dealt with adversity,
[00:15:27] they've been in panic situations in Minkom,
[00:15:30] versus someone who, I don't know,
[00:15:33] let's say is open to more dirty things,
[00:15:35] but it's never practiced it in real life.
[00:15:37] Then again, if someone has actually been through life
[00:15:38] in that situation and used it, that's good, I guess.
[00:15:41] But I think it's important to find that training medium.
[00:15:44] So gloves, in fact, I guess I should wear my gloves
[00:15:47] when I train, but if you don't wear gloves,
[00:15:51] your hands get stronger, but you can also hurt your hands.
[00:15:55] So gloves have a place, but then again,
[00:15:57] you can't rely upon big gloves in boxing.
[00:15:58] You have no gloves and you can't cover up the same.
[00:16:02] So I think it's important to find the happy balance,
[00:16:05] that medium between hard training and realism.
[00:16:07] Yeah, and that's what the UFC did,
[00:16:11] and really Jiu Jitsu is a huge part of this,
[00:16:13] is you can train full speed, right?
[00:16:15] You can go hard, and look, you can spar in boxing,
[00:16:19] and you can, in wrestling, you're going live
[00:16:22] against other people, but when you take that
[00:16:24] and put it together into martial art,
[00:16:26] Jiu Jitsu was like bringing that forward,
[00:16:29] and boxing did it, wrestling did it,
[00:16:31] Jiu Jitsu does it, Muay Thai does it,
[00:16:33] but who didn't do it was like Dim Mock,
[00:16:36] and the old kind of weird traditional martial arts
[00:16:40] that didn't actually do anything, except for theory.
[00:16:45] So as the UFC happened, we started to see this
[00:16:50] in the military, and people in the military
[00:16:53] started learning and testing,
[00:16:54] and started to move the military combatives
[00:17:00] to a much better place.
[00:17:01] And one of the leaders in this, the guy named Matt Larson,
[00:17:03] I don't actually know him, but everybody kind of knows him.
[00:17:07] He's a former Marine, former Army Ranger,
[00:17:10] and he's, I think he's pretty much known
[00:17:13] as the father of modern army combatives.
[00:17:16] He's the one that started to train and formalize,
[00:17:20] and kind of push this well-rounded approach,
[00:17:23] realistic approach to hand-to-hand combat,
[00:17:28] and eventually his work, and look,
[00:17:31] I'm giving one person all the credit right now,
[00:17:32] I'm sure he would talk about all the people
[00:17:35] that helped him get there,
[00:17:35] but this is the person that I know of that was involved,
[00:17:39] and like I said, I'm sure there's many more people,
[00:17:41] but he certainly was a spearhead on this,
[00:17:44] and his work, and whoever he was working with at the time,
[00:17:49] eventually became an Army Field Manual,
[00:17:53] an Army Field Manual, three-tact 25.150 combatives.
[00:17:58] And I thought today maybe we could take a look at this manual,
[00:18:03] go through some of the highlights,
[00:18:04] discuss how it can be applied,
[00:18:06] and not only can it be applied to how we fight, of course,
[00:18:09] but also how we train and how we live.
[00:18:13] So there you go, let's take a look at this manual,
[00:18:16] combatives, picture of a dude with a freaking K-bar
[00:18:21] on the cover, gotta love that.
[00:18:23] Here's the overview.
[00:18:24] The overview to kick this thing off,
[00:18:27] it says combatives training stands apart
[00:18:30] from the vast majority of martial arts training
[00:18:32] in that producing the individual's actual fighting ability
[00:18:36] is of primary concern.
[00:18:39] The mental and physical benefits of training
[00:18:41] gain their worth from usefulness
[00:18:43] in producing more capable soldiers.
[00:18:45] Now, I'm not 100% sure I agree with that opening statement,
[00:18:50] only because it says, you know, combatives training,
[00:18:53] the main thing about combatives training
[00:18:57] is that you're trying to improve
[00:18:58] the fighting ability of the person.
[00:19:00] Doesn't all Jiu-Jitsu and boxing and Muay Thai
[00:19:03] trying to make you a better fighter?
[00:19:04] I must be misreading that or something,
[00:19:07] but that's what we're trying to do,
[00:19:10] is make someone a better fighter.
[00:19:14] I guess I'll go with it.
[00:19:15] Purpose, combatives, the art of hand-to-hand combat
[00:19:19] bridges the gap between physical training and tactics.
[00:19:22] The products of a good physical training plan,
[00:19:24] strength, endurance, and flexibility
[00:19:25] must be directed toward the mission,
[00:19:27] and soldiers must be prepared to use
[00:19:28] different levels of force in an environment
[00:19:30] where the intensity of a conflict changes quickly.
[00:19:33] Many military operations, such as peacekeeping missions
[00:19:36] or non-combatant evacuation,
[00:19:38] may restrict the use of lethal force.
[00:19:41] Combatives training prepares the soldier
[00:19:43] to use the appropriate amount of force for any situation.
[00:19:48] Okay, so that's always good.
[00:19:51] And you know, sometimes people ask me,
[00:19:53] have you ever used hand-to-hand?
[00:19:54] And they actually think my answer's gonna be no.
[00:19:58] And they think that most people would never use hand-to-hand,
[00:20:01] but it actually is very common to use
[00:20:05] combatives techniques in combat.
[00:20:07] Why?
[00:20:08] Because you're dealing with civilians,
[00:20:10] you're dealing with unarmed people,
[00:20:12] and you can't just run around shooting everybody
[00:20:14] in a semi-permissive environment,
[00:20:16] or even in a wartime environment,
[00:20:17] you see someone that's not armed or you enter a building,
[00:20:21] just there's a male, a female, a kid
[00:20:24] that doesn't have a weapon, you have to contend with them.
[00:20:28] So combatives are very important to have as a skill set,
[00:20:33] to handle, you know, actually when the enemy has a gun,
[00:20:36] it makes everything easier.
[00:20:38] You kill them, you shoot them, done deal, no factor.
[00:20:44] Would you write down, D?
[00:20:46] A couple of things about the origin of martial arts
[00:20:47] and how some things have shaped regionally.
[00:20:50] Like, this is a little before, but also,
[00:20:53] I was in Mitch One D, I saw someone
[00:20:56] from one military service of one country.
[00:20:59] I wanted to know, we'll get too specific,
[00:21:00] but I saw the person teaching.
[00:21:03] His knuckles right here on his hand,
[00:21:06] like he has a boxer with big gloves.
[00:21:07] If you do that with no gloves,
[00:21:08] your own hand will cut your face.
[00:21:11] Yep.
[00:21:11] So things like that, they're teaching the recruits,
[00:21:13] I'm talking to like 200 people in the class,
[00:21:15] it was one of our services, I won't say which one,
[00:21:18] and teaching people to hold it like this,
[00:21:19] I'm saying, well, even in boxing, I wouldn't do that,
[00:21:21] but with big gloves, it makes for a sense,
[00:21:23] you can see over that right there,
[00:21:24] is someone who actually has never been punched
[00:21:26] in the face without gloves on.
[00:21:29] Teaching that to 200 people at a time,
[00:21:30] I'm like, I didn't correct them.
[00:21:32] I would, but you know, he's having them like this,
[00:21:34] I'm like, you know, at least want to be here,
[00:21:35] or maybe, it's just interesting that that person
[00:21:38] teaching people how to punch with no gloves on,
[00:21:41] probably has never punched in the face.
[00:21:43] And he may be a skilled boxer.
[00:21:44] Yep, absolutely, yeah, probably.
[00:21:46] He's probably, may have been punched in the head,
[00:21:49] you know, while he had his cover up,
[00:21:51] and you can realize you can absorb,
[00:21:53] you've got their big glove versus going into your big glove,
[00:21:56] and it absorbs.
[00:21:58] You take those big gloves off,
[00:22:00] you punch right through that person's hand.
[00:22:02] So that is a little bit, we're looking at a sport boxing,
[00:22:04] which is great, I love boxing,
[00:22:05] but if you do not alter that part,
[00:22:08] by the way, not every boxer does this,
[00:22:09] I'm saying this person, some boxer's in the corner,
[00:22:11] you cover him like this, if you don't alter that rule,
[00:22:14] that would actually cause you to get a lot of damage
[00:22:16] in a fight, because this also,
[00:22:18] you don't cover much of your face with these little hands,
[00:22:20] the same, but without gloves.
[00:22:22] So that's the example, I was just trying to say how
[00:22:24] we're looking for the happy medium,
[00:22:26] because we're dealing with the military,
[00:22:27] not boxing and not wrestling.
[00:22:29] It's actually a military application.
[00:22:31] Yep.
[00:22:33] It goes on to say here,
[00:22:34] combatives training includes arduous physical training
[00:22:36] that is mentally demanding and carries over
[00:22:38] to other military pursuits.
[00:22:39] This training produces soldiers who
[00:22:42] understand controlled aggression and remain focused
[00:22:45] while under duress.
[00:22:47] That's awesome.
[00:22:48] That's true.
[00:22:48] Right, so when you get good at fighting,
[00:22:50] it's gonna help you stay calm in other situations.
[00:22:54] That's an awesome aspect of training.
[00:22:58] You process the skills requisite to the mission
[00:23:02] at levels in all the spectrum,
[00:23:04] in all the levels of spectrum of force.
[00:23:07] So you're gonna learn how to control different scenarios.
[00:23:10] Have attributes that make up the warrior ethos,
[00:23:12] personal courage, self confidence,
[00:23:14] self discipline and a spree to core.
[00:23:16] That's huge.
[00:23:18] It's so good for people to know how to fight.
[00:23:22] It's just so good for people to know how to fight.
[00:23:24] You actually, when you know how to fight,
[00:23:27] you become less arrogant.
[00:23:28] Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:29] You might be, if you're 20 years old,
[00:23:32] you might have a spike in your arrogance, right?
[00:23:34] Echo Chaw's, you're smiling at that one.
[00:23:36] Yeah, there are exceptions, we'll just say that.
[00:23:39] Yeah, where you get a little spike in your arrogance,
[00:23:41] but over time, you'll realize, okay,
[00:23:44] the reason I'm good is because I trained more
[00:23:46] and guess what, there's someone that's trained more
[00:23:48] than me and that's the way it is.
[00:23:49] So generally speaking, it'll help yourself confidence
[00:23:53] while at the same time,
[00:23:54] preventing you from becoming arrogant.
[00:23:56] Yeah, you gotta beat up so much,
[00:23:57] you have to be calm, you know.
[00:23:58] I mean, it's humbling, man.
[00:24:01] It's humbling.
[00:24:02] You remember the first time you tapped me out
[00:24:04] a hundred times in the gym when I first showed up?
[00:24:07] I was a young seal rolling in there,
[00:24:10] thinking I knew how to fight, didn't know Jack.
[00:24:14] If Jack would, when he would tap you, he would just tap.
[00:24:16] Like, don't.
[00:24:17] Like, don't.
[00:24:18] No expression on the face, just, let's train again.
[00:24:23] Yeah.
[00:24:24] Yeah.
[00:24:27] So it's humbling, especially, what were you,
[00:24:29] 17 or 18 when we started training?
[00:24:31] 19 years old.
[00:24:32] 19 years old, you were 170 pounds.
[00:24:34] Yeah.
[00:24:34] And I was like 220.
[00:24:36] I was a grown man, you were a kid.
[00:24:38] And I'm like, this poor guy, I'm gonna smash his little head.
[00:24:44] Yeah.
[00:24:47] Throughout modern history,
[00:24:48] attempts to build successful combative systems have failed
[00:24:51] or have been met with limited success.
[00:24:53] This has happened for several reasons.
[00:24:54] Quite naturally, commanders desire a system
[00:24:56] that doesn't require any training time to learn and maintain.
[00:24:59] So that's a real problem out of the gate.
[00:25:01] People think, well, you know, I saw a thing
[00:25:04] where you can just learn four deadly moves
[00:25:06] and you're gonna be good to go.
[00:25:07] Why don't we just use that, bro?
[00:25:07] That's what I'm talking about, exactly.
[00:25:09] Four deadly moves to end any street fight.
[00:25:12] The commander's like, hey, I think what you just learned,
[00:25:13] I saw those four deadly moves,
[00:25:15] why don't we just focus on those?
[00:25:16] That way you're gonna have to spend a bunch of time.
[00:25:18] He's a guy, he actually has, it's like a,
[00:25:20] it's tagged in like YouTube,
[00:25:22] so it's like X Army Ranger,
[00:25:25] plus 10 years of bouncing experience,
[00:25:27] is one over 500 bar fights,
[00:25:29] never been hit in the face once by a system.
[00:25:32] I'm just like, I'm not gonna check it out,
[00:25:34] just win every fight in three, four seconds, just whatever.
[00:25:37] Now there's ways to surprise people,
[00:25:38] there's ways to look over there
[00:25:40] and hit someone, there's ways to have your friend.
[00:25:41] I mean, there's all kinds of tricks,
[00:25:43] to trick, you can trick someone out in public,
[00:25:45] but I don't know, just funny how this get strong,
[00:25:50] quick, with no sacrifice game,
[00:25:52] or get rich quick, that's what I was saying earlier.
[00:25:54] I don't know, it's kind of like, not the future.
[00:25:57] Yep.
[00:25:58] Yep, it's gonna take some time.
[00:26:01] Continuing on, further training has often been conducted
[00:26:03] by experts in civilian martial arts.
[00:26:05] These experts use training methodologies
[00:26:07] that are designed for more civilian hobbyists
[00:26:09] than in realities of war.
[00:26:10] That's exactly what you were just talking about
[00:26:11] with the boxing gloves, right?
[00:26:13] Oh, I'm a great boxer, I'll teach you how to box, cool.
[00:26:15] But I'm not wearing gloves, now I'm breaking my hand,
[00:26:16] now I'm getting punched in the face
[00:26:17] when I thought I was covered up,
[00:26:18] it's like, there's the issues.
[00:26:22] Often, combatives training has been approached
[00:26:25] by allowing a soldier versed in a civilian martial art
[00:26:27] to use a limited amount of training time,
[00:26:30] usually during another course,
[00:26:32] to teach a useful technique.
[00:26:33] Blinded by their civilian training,
[00:26:35] the trainer demonstrates what the trainer thinks
[00:26:37] are simple, effective, and easy to learn techniques,
[00:26:39] selected based on situations soldiers may find themselves
[00:26:42] or in a tactical niche of the specialist training.
[00:26:45] The trainer teaches the soldiers these techniques,
[00:26:47] but due to the limited amount of training time,
[00:26:49] the soldier quickly forgets them.
[00:26:50] The soldiers quickly forget them.
[00:26:52] To overcome these tendencies,
[00:26:53] a combatives training system must be based
[00:26:55] on certain principles and then maintained.
[00:26:57] So, this was another thing I ran into that in the SEAL teams,
[00:26:59] like for a while, the SEAL teams was using this system
[00:27:01] where one of the best benefits of the system
[00:27:07] claimed by the people that were pushing the system was,
[00:27:09] hey, this system that we're being taught
[00:27:12] only takes five days to learn.
[00:27:14] Yeah.
[00:27:14] So, and meanwhile, some people are talking about
[00:27:17] becoming, using more mixed martial arts based systems
[00:27:21] when those things take years to become an expert.
[00:27:24] Why would we do that?
[00:27:26] It's sort of like seven minute abs, right?
[00:27:28] It's like, this is it.
[00:27:29] You're like, dude, I'm not,
[00:27:30] why do all this cardio weightlifting and diet
[00:27:33] and all this stuff?
[00:27:34] I can just do seven minute abs
[00:27:35] and I'll be good to go with the abs.
[00:27:37] Six minute abs.
[00:27:38] Six minute abs.
[00:27:39] I'll sell you.
[00:27:40] Oh yeah, you outsold me.
[00:27:41] So, don't fall for that, that idea that,
[00:27:47] oh, the reason you should use my system
[00:27:49] is because it's faster.
[00:27:51] It's not a good, it's not real.
[00:27:54] Cause you're not gonna become a good fighter in five days.
[00:27:58] Could you learn a couple fundamental moves in five days?
[00:28:01] Yes, you absolutely could.
[00:28:02] You absolutely can and they could save your life.
[00:28:04] Yeah.
[00:28:05] You know, you could, you could,
[00:28:06] your life could be saved by knowing some fundamental moves
[00:28:10] that you learn in a five day period.
[00:28:15] But are you gonna be well versed?
[00:28:16] No.
[00:28:17] Are you gonna forget those moves?
[00:28:19] Yes.
[00:28:20] Are you gonna know how to react
[00:28:21] when there's a variable involved?
[00:28:22] No.
[00:28:23] So, there is no easy, quick solution to be good at fighting.
[00:28:29] It doesn't exist.
[00:28:30] Could you learn, you know, three dynamic moves
[00:28:35] that if you're a bouncer in a bar
[00:28:36] and you're going against some drunk guy
[00:28:38] that doesn't expect it and you do these moves,
[00:28:39] that'll probably work a lot.
[00:28:41] What happens when that dude drops in
[00:28:43] and does a double leg on you, you know?
[00:28:45] Or squares up and is like a skilled fighter.
[00:28:49] It's gonna be a problem.
[00:28:51] So, here's the principles that they recommend.
[00:28:54] Systematic training, foundation, continuous training,
[00:28:57] competition drills, live training,
[00:28:59] integrated training, combat feedback.
[00:29:01] Cool.
[00:29:02] What'd you write, Dave?
[00:29:03] No, I was gonna say like a kind of funny story.
[00:29:06] Like we're talking about weight loss.
[00:29:07] But so, you know, let's say when I go through
[00:29:09] my weight cutting phase, you know,
[00:29:11] I'll lose like 15 pounds in 10 days.
[00:29:14] And then I'll cut water weight, which is really unhealthy,
[00:29:16] but it's really, really bad for you to do that.
[00:29:18] But, you know, cut 33 pounds in 12 days,
[00:29:22] whatever you were there with me on that.
[00:29:24] But so, how do you lose that much weight in two weeks?
[00:29:27] I'm like, well, it's not sustainable, you know?
[00:29:28] I'd be honest, it's not the secret.
[00:29:30] You could do that, but it's a miserable life.
[00:29:31] It's hard to do and you can't do it forever.
[00:29:34] And remember when we were in Sarge,
[00:29:35] when he tried to cut 50 pounds in a week?
[00:29:38] And he had the look of death in his eye.
[00:29:42] So, Sarge lost like 25 pounds, right?
[00:29:45] Because Sarge, my Sarge is a good friend of ours, an ex-seal,
[00:29:49] but he actually, I think he was trying to lose 40 pounds
[00:29:51] or something like that.
[00:29:52] Yeah, he went and look, Sarge is about as hard as they come.
[00:29:55] As far as like just being like,
[00:29:57] I'm gonna finish this thing, whatever it is,
[00:30:00] he's up there in the top echelon of,
[00:30:03] I'm not gonna give up on this thing.
[00:30:05] And it was almost walking dead, almost walking dead.
[00:30:07] I mean, and I remember I showed up at the gym
[00:30:12] and I saw him and he'd already, he was like.
[00:30:14] He was done.
[00:30:16] He was like, yeah, I was cutting.
[00:30:18] And he goes, he looked at me and with that dead serious look,
[00:30:21] he was like, I was gonna die soon.
[00:30:23] That was his assessment.
[00:30:26] He was like, yeah, he goes, I got down.
[00:30:28] I got 38 pounds and whatever.
[00:30:30] And he goes, and then I got to a point
[00:30:32] where I was gonna die soon.
[00:30:34] And he's a Corman, he's a medic.
[00:30:35] He's an independent duty Corman,
[00:30:38] which is like the highest level of,
[00:30:40] and you know, a special operation Corman.
[00:30:41] He needs little surgeries.
[00:30:42] So he's just like, yeah, I was gonna die soon.
[00:30:44] That was his assessment.
[00:30:45] So I was trying to tell you a story about one of our bros,
[00:30:47] but it's just funny, it's funny in a sadistic way,
[00:30:49] but even Sarge would laugh at it too.
[00:30:51] He has a good sense of humor, our type of humor.
[00:30:54] But so there is a way to lose weight that fast,
[00:30:56] but it's not sustainable, it's not healthy.
[00:30:58] Plus you have to know what you're doing
[00:30:59] and then you have no one to do it correctly.
[00:31:01] And then you cause again trouble.
[00:31:02] So weight loss, how about quick way to lose weight?
[00:31:04] Yeah, see it's possible, but it sucks.
[00:31:06] It's miserable, it's not sustainable.
[00:31:07] But you can actually get on a sensible diet,
[00:31:09] get into a consistent workout routine.
[00:31:11] And you know what?
[00:31:11] You could lose, let's say two pounds a week.
[00:31:13] You could do that consistently, you know, you can.
[00:31:16] And actually have energy, you can be fine.
[00:31:17] You'll be hungry, but you'll be fine.
[00:31:20] But it takes discipline, right?
[00:31:21] Discipline, so I'm talking to this, learn it.
[00:31:25] I see what they're saying, it sounds marketable,
[00:31:27] but as I was mentioning earlier,
[00:31:30] the quick fix way to get around things in training
[00:31:32] is usually not the best way.
[00:31:33] You're gonna have to put in the time, people.
[00:31:35] Yeah.
[00:31:37] And this is exactly what they say here.
[00:31:39] This next section is called systematic training.
[00:31:41] Learning to fight is a process, not an event.
[00:31:44] To be effective, combatives training
[00:31:45] must be part of a system.
[00:31:47] Until soldiers learn techniques
[00:31:49] that form the system's foundation,
[00:31:51] they are unprepared for follow on training.
[00:31:53] Short cuts or teaching soldiers,
[00:31:55] what they need to know is counterproductive.
[00:31:58] Much as advanced tactical training is counterproductive,
[00:32:02] if a soldier has not first been taught
[00:32:03] how to operate his weapon.
[00:32:04] Army combatives training must be based in a system
[00:32:08] that both lays a foundation of abilities
[00:32:10] that soldiers take with them wherever they are assigned
[00:32:12] and is flexible enough to fit
[00:32:13] the wide range of specialized missions soldiers are asked to do.
[00:32:17] So it's the same thing that we're talking about.
[00:32:19] Continuous training.
[00:32:21] Combatives training must not end
[00:32:23] upon graduation from a training course.
[00:32:27] And this is, by the way,
[00:32:28] everything we're saying applies to police officers as well.
[00:32:29] Yeah.
[00:32:31] Unfortunately, a lot of cops,
[00:32:32] they don't have any more training after they got out
[00:32:34] of the academy. No, it's horrible.
[00:32:35] Or they get three hours a year or four hours a year.
[00:32:38] Yeah.
[00:32:40] So training has to be continuous.
[00:32:42] It can't end when you graduate.
[00:32:44] For soldiers to develop their abilities,
[00:32:45] the majority of training must happen
[00:32:47] outside of the institutional training environment.
[00:32:48] So think about that.
[00:32:49] The majority of training has to be outside
[00:32:52] what you learn in the schoolhouse.
[00:32:56] Units must develop their own combatives programs
[00:32:58] to spur troops to involvement and courage commanders
[00:33:00] to invest resources.
[00:33:02] So there you go.
[00:33:02] Competition.
[00:33:04] Competition is the principal motivational tool
[00:33:06] used to spur combatives training.
[00:33:09] Competition should be not only used to encourage excellence
[00:33:12] by giving soldiers a chance to be unit champions,
[00:33:15] but also to make fighting ability
[00:33:17] an integral part of soldiering.
[00:33:20] So if you're not running some competitions,
[00:33:22] you're not gonna get people to train.
[00:33:24] And look, can you get someone that's like,
[00:33:25] hey, I'm just dedicated, no one might need it on the job?
[00:33:27] Sure.
[00:33:28] But how many of those 20-year-olds that we're talking about
[00:33:31] is gonna be like, dude, are you gonna do the brigade competition?
[00:33:35] See who's got it?
[00:33:36] Got it?
[00:33:37] See where you're at?
[00:33:39] And by the way, what about you're doing
[00:33:41] the brigade composition.
[00:33:42] So you might wanna like train,
[00:33:44] so you're at least ready for yourself,
[00:33:45] look like a jag-ass.
[00:33:49] Talks about drills.
[00:33:51] You know, you gotta do drills.
[00:33:52] Live training, live training involves training
[00:33:54] against a fully resistant training partner,
[00:33:57] which approaches the reality of combat.
[00:33:59] That's what you were talking about earlier, Dean.
[00:34:01] There are many methods of live training.
[00:34:02] Each has its own strength and weaknesses.
[00:34:04] Therefore, leadership combines several approaches
[00:34:05] to ensure proper training.
[00:34:07] Integrated training.
[00:34:09] Combative engagements do not happen in a vacuum.
[00:34:11] They happen as part of a mission.
[00:34:12] So give soldiers the tools
[00:34:15] they need to successfully complete their missions.
[00:34:17] Combatives must be an integral part of the training.
[00:34:19] So that means you can't just make it an isolated, okay.
[00:34:24] Like, you know what a red man suit is?
[00:34:26] Red man suit is like the guy you can punch
[00:34:28] because they're wearing like a big padded outfit.
[00:34:30] Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:31] Well, you need to integrate that
[00:34:32] into a random part of a regular mission,
[00:34:34] a regular training mission.
[00:34:36] You can't say, oh, today we're doing combatives only.
[00:34:38] No, you need to walk into a room
[00:34:39] and there's gotta be some person in a red man suit
[00:34:41] just ready to throw down.
[00:34:43] And you gotta deal with it.
[00:34:44] And you gotta see how it affects everyone else in the room
[00:34:46] and how many people it takes
[00:34:47] and how it slows down the assault force
[00:34:49] and all that stuff.
[00:34:51] That's integrated training.
[00:34:54] Combat, what'd you write down, Dean?
[00:34:56] Just different things.
[00:34:57] I was just, I had random stories.
[00:35:01] I was gonna say, remember this,
[00:35:02] even people listen to this, you know, yeah, yeah,
[00:35:04] but the pretty lie is more appealing than the ugly truth.
[00:35:08] You know, so the ugly truth is,
[00:35:09] it's not really ugly if you get into it,
[00:35:11] you get into the sport, it's not so ugly.
[00:35:12] Or maybe that is the beauty of it in a way.
[00:35:15] But the pretty lie is always still appealing.
[00:35:18] I have a 40 course for you, you know,
[00:35:21] you're guaranteed to win every fight.
[00:35:22] That's still appealing to most people.
[00:35:24] Still is, even though we're seeing this.
[00:35:26] And I just hope that people listening to this,
[00:35:29] it's not, well, it is, it can be torturous,
[00:35:33] but it's something that lights a fire in your ass.
[00:35:35] But every day, as far as you wanna train more,
[00:35:37] I can get sick of Jiu-Jitsu for one day,
[00:35:39] and the next day I'm fine.
[00:35:40] I'm back into it for some reason.
[00:35:41] You can say give it a like, man,
[00:35:42] to the next day you're like, okay, you know, I'm back to it.
[00:35:45] You can definitely have a rough day on the box.
[00:35:46] Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true.
[00:35:48] It's just that we talk about work,
[00:35:51] repetition, drills, competition, all this stuff.
[00:35:53] It seems like a lot to do, it is a lot to do.
[00:35:55] But I mean, this is the ugly truth, you know what I'm saying?
[00:35:58] So that's just what I was writing down,
[00:36:00] just that the pretty lie is still appealing to people
[00:36:02] that are listening to this right now.
[00:36:03] The pretty lie is still out there,
[00:36:05] it's still, we saw that people are gonna be tempted by it.
[00:36:07] Yeah, still.
[00:36:07] And the pretty lie you want, you want it to be true.
[00:36:10] Because it's easier.
[00:36:11] It's true.
[00:36:12] You want it to be true.
[00:36:13] That's how Get Rich Quick schemes work, right?
[00:36:16] People want to believe that a mere $1,299 investment now
[00:36:22] when you learn these skills.
[00:36:24] That's true.
[00:36:25] Choco, I wanted to believe that you could lose
[00:36:28] 18 pounds of water by being in an Epsom salt tub
[00:36:32] in half hour.
[00:36:33] I wanted to believe that.
[00:36:34] It was not true.
[00:36:35] No, quarter pound.
[00:36:37] Have you ever missed weight?
[00:36:38] No, no, I was made weight.
[00:36:39] Yeah.
[00:36:40] Yeah, I was made weight.
[00:36:41] Man, you suffered a few times.
[00:36:43] Yeah, I have big bones, I don't know.
[00:36:45] It's not fun.
[00:36:46] Big bones and pizza, bro.
[00:36:48] Pizza.
[00:36:49] You could do it a couple times.
[00:36:52] It was like, all right, let's check your weight.
[00:36:55] Oh, you're 28 pounds over
[00:36:58] and you gotta fight in six days.
[00:37:01] You gotta get pizza for it.
[00:37:02] How's that pizza tasting?
[00:37:03] I hope it was good.
[00:37:06] Now you gotta pay.
[00:37:09] Combat feedback, when soldiers engaged
[00:37:11] or engaged in hand to hand combat,
[00:37:12] they acquire new information about combatants.
[00:37:14] These lessons must be captured and analyzed
[00:37:16] so the combatants program evolves
[00:37:19] to fit the needs of soldiers.
[00:37:21] Through combat feedback,
[00:37:23] the following lessons have been learned
[00:37:24] and it goes through every fight is a grappling fight.
[00:37:27] Of course, this does not mean that there is no striking.
[00:37:29] Every fight also involves striking,
[00:37:31] but always as an integral part of grappling.
[00:37:35] Every fight is over weapons.
[00:37:37] Control of this element
[00:37:38] will most likely determine the outcome of the fight.
[00:37:41] There's no shortcut to developing a fighting skill.
[00:37:43] The combat feedback thing,
[00:37:44] this is something like even when I was trying
[00:37:48] to move naval special warfare
[00:37:51] more towards a mixed martial arts view,
[00:37:57] and some people would be like,
[00:37:59] you think it should be jujitsu?
[00:38:01] And I'd be like, no, actually,
[00:38:01] I don't just think it should be jujitsu at all.
[00:38:05] And in fact, and this was the most important thing
[00:38:06] I tried to say was it shouldn't be closed.
[00:38:09] It shouldn't be a closed,
[00:38:10] it shouldn't even be a quote system.
[00:38:13] It should be an open learning, continuous learning,
[00:38:19] evolving thing that we're always getting better at.
[00:38:22] And that way there's things that work and they work now
[00:38:24] and maybe if in the future
[00:38:25] we have a different type of body armor
[00:38:27] that is more dynamic or it takes up more space
[00:38:30] or it's heavier or lighter or whatever,
[00:38:31] like things are gonna change.
[00:38:33] Or the way you're slinging your weapon now
[00:38:35] or a different radio you gotta carry with that
[00:38:37] causes something or a helmet.
[00:38:38] Like there's all kinds of things
[00:38:39] you gotta make adjustments to.
[00:38:40] You grapple with plates on the body armor plates.
[00:38:43] Cause the plates get really,
[00:38:44] they get really in the way, let's say.
[00:38:46] Yeah.
[00:38:47] And there's certain things that,
[00:38:49] yeah, there's certain things
[00:38:50] that might not be optimum with plates.
[00:38:53] And so, okay, well, what adjustments are you gonna make?
[00:38:55] And maybe a new set of body armor comes out,
[00:38:57] like you could put something called side zappy plates in
[00:39:00] which now you have plates on your side.
[00:39:01] And how does that inhibit your movement?
[00:39:03] You're gonna find this ridiculous jockel
[00:39:04] playing with the front plate and the back plate
[00:39:07] and that's a belt on with, you know, whatever.
[00:39:10] I don't say just stuff on the belt.
[00:39:12] And I set up and guard and I had a little,
[00:39:16] I was a little heavier back then
[00:39:18] and the front plate pinched my, with the belt.
[00:39:21] And you tapped out.
[00:39:21] Come on, I can't set up a guard to say, wait, wait.
[00:39:27] Yeah, body armor is just a different thing.
[00:39:29] So there's, we gotta watch out for that belly fat.
[00:39:31] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:39:31] Well, you guys, there's a weight.
[00:39:32] No, there's no problem.
[00:39:33] We gotta stay lean.
[00:39:35] So that's, that's good.
[00:39:36] It's ridiculous.
[00:39:38] The idea that whatever you're training in should evolve.
[00:39:42] And look, it's beautiful to see right now
[00:39:44] Jujitsu evolving like crazy.
[00:39:46] And it's kind of evolving exponentially.
[00:39:49] I think Jujitsu is evolving exponentially now
[00:39:52] cause every one move leads, let's just say theoretically
[00:39:55] every one move leads to two moves.
[00:39:58] Would you say that's something you could say, could claim?
[00:40:00] It should, it should, yeah.
[00:40:01] Maybe even one move.
[00:40:02] It could be that one move leads to four moves
[00:40:05] and some one moves lead to seven moves.
[00:40:07] But let's just say in general, conservatively,
[00:40:10] every one move leads to two moves.
[00:40:12] Sure.
[00:40:13] So there's been so many new moves created
[00:40:15] in the last 10 years that, and they've all created
[00:40:18] and spawned more moves and more moves and more moves.
[00:40:20] So it's a highly evolving sport.
[00:40:25] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:40:27] And some things that some things have been forgotten
[00:40:29] or re-invented again for sure.
[00:40:32] Someone's done a lot of things before.
[00:40:34] Some things have been forgotten.
[00:40:35] Some things are out of style,
[00:40:35] but some things are definitely being invented right now.
[00:40:40] All right.
[00:40:41] Then this is a really thorough manual.
[00:40:43] And this is what the army does, man.
[00:40:44] The army doesn't play around.
[00:40:45] They leave no room for interpretation on stuff.
[00:40:48] They got things on safety.
[00:40:49] They got the things on risk assessments
[00:40:52] on how you're gonna keep everybody safe
[00:40:53] while you're doing it.
[00:40:54] One thing they say is combatives training
[00:40:57] has inherent risks.
[00:40:57] These risks may not be readily apparent
[00:41:00] and are sometimes counterintuitive to the untrained person.
[00:41:02] Therefore, a combatives instructor certified
[00:41:04] at the appropriate level should be involved
[00:41:06] in the process to mitigate these risks.
[00:41:09] And it's also important as a trainer
[00:41:13] to be able to point out the risks of not training.
[00:41:15] Like if you don't train,
[00:41:16] because listen, if you train, you can sprain your ankle.
[00:41:19] If you train, you can hurt your shoulder.
[00:41:21] But if you don't train, what's the risk there?
[00:41:24] The risk is you can...
[00:41:25] Worst.
[00:41:25] Yeah, it's gonna end up being worse.
[00:41:28] So they go through how to set up a training area,
[00:41:33] what's general safety precautions to make.
[00:41:36] And then they got this thing.
[00:41:38] This is interesting.
[00:41:39] According to a report published
[00:41:41] by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center,
[00:41:44] 730 individuals who served in an active or reserve component
[00:41:48] in the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps
[00:41:50] were hospitalized or medically evacuated
[00:41:53] for injuries incurred while performing wrestling, judo,
[00:41:58] and unarmed combat training between January 2002
[00:42:01] and December 2009.
[00:42:04] This averages to roughly 100 personnel per year
[00:42:07] during an eight year period.
[00:42:10] Now, quite frankly, that's not that bad, I don't think.
[00:42:12] I think that's actually pretty darn good to go,
[00:42:14] considering how many people are actually training.
[00:42:17] It says it should be noted that 194 personnel,
[00:42:20] 40% of those hospitalized and 26.6% of all injuries
[00:42:24] were injured while off duty or have unknown duty status.
[00:42:29] Unsupervised execution of combatives techniques
[00:42:32] is strongly discouraged.
[00:42:33] This also means some of that percentage is I got a bar fight.
[00:42:36] And I went to my gunny sergeant and said,
[00:42:39] hey, gunny, I was training combatives
[00:42:42] and I broke my hand on my training partner's face.
[00:42:46] Well, how's your body?
[00:42:47] Oh, he's okay, but I need to get my cast.
[00:42:51] So there's some of that going on.
[00:42:55] Areas of the body most commonly injured
[00:42:58] of the injuries documented in the study,
[00:42:59] a large percentage of 45.6% occurred
[00:43:02] in the lower extremities.
[00:43:04] In fact, fractures primarily of the ankle, tibia, or fibula,
[00:43:08] accounted for nearly one half of the injuries.
[00:43:13] That's the thing to hide in me.
[00:43:14] And you know what it shows you?
[00:43:15] They're doing a lot of takedowns.
[00:43:17] They're doing a lot of takedowns.
[00:43:18] But isn't it weird also fractures?
[00:43:21] They're talking about fractures.
[00:43:24] And so fractures percentage was 50%.
[00:43:29] Sprains and strains was only 13%.
[00:43:31] And what I thought to myself is that's
[00:43:32] because you know what, you don't have to go to the hospital
[00:43:34] for a sprain or a strain, so you're not reporting it.
[00:43:36] I mean, how many times have you hurt your ankle
[00:43:41] or your knee training?
[00:43:43] A few times, kickboxing a few times.
[00:43:45] And not going to the hospital.
[00:43:48] Many times.
[00:43:49] I mean, it's like ridiculous, right?
[00:43:51] How many times did I go home?
[00:43:51] Like, I've kind of limping a little bit.
[00:43:53] You know, my shoulders tweaked.
[00:43:55] My elbow got straightened out, the enlistor, whatever.
[00:43:59] So I think a lot of the strain,
[00:44:01] I think sprains and strains is actually,
[00:44:03] you're gonna get them.
[00:44:04] It's like almost 100%.
[00:44:05] Yeah.
[00:44:06] But people just kind of like,
[00:44:07] oh, just put ice on it and call it good.
[00:44:09] Well, you think maybe that these lower extremities,
[00:44:12] injuries is from like kicking?
[00:44:15] Well, I don't know.
[00:44:16] My goodness.
[00:44:17] I think it's takedowns.
[00:44:19] Takedowns, yeah.
[00:44:19] Straight up fractures, I mean, I guess.
[00:44:22] Also, you know how maybe they'll turn the wrong way?
[00:44:24] You know, a good rest of the face with hips.
[00:44:25] You know, I'm just saying, like when someone's learning,
[00:44:27] you're going through those rough areas
[00:44:29] where more likely to get hurt, you know?
[00:44:31] Yeah, actually, if you think about
[00:44:33] how many broken bones have you seen
[00:44:37] on the mats during training?
[00:44:39] Not many.
[00:44:40] Yeah, no, it's usually the ankle.
[00:44:41] I think I've seen two.
[00:44:43] I think I've seen two.
[00:44:44] One like ankle and one shoulder.
[00:44:49] Radial.
[00:44:50] Yeah, I got caught in, my buddy got caught in.
[00:44:52] Bicep slicer.
[00:44:53] Bicep slicer.
[00:44:54] And I heard it crack.
[00:44:56] Spiral fracture.
[00:44:58] And he was in the,
[00:44:59] it's still going on deployment.
[00:45:01] Damn.
[00:45:02] But yeah, that's why it's weird.
[00:45:04] But how many people,
[00:45:05] how many times have you seen someone get a sprained ankle,
[00:45:08] a sprained knee?
[00:45:08] It's like, you can't count them all.
[00:45:10] So this is a weird thing.
[00:45:12] This is a weird thing.
[00:45:14] And then it goes on to dislocations
[00:45:16] and skull or bone fractures
[00:45:19] and other intercranial injuries,
[00:45:21] other injuries, concussions.
[00:45:23] Concussions, they've only got a 3%.
[00:45:25] Choco, I think people get hurt on the obstacle course.
[00:45:28] You know what I'm saying?
[00:45:29] On the obstacle course, probably not a ton,
[00:45:32] but how many people get hurt
[00:45:33] going through land warfare training out in the desert?
[00:45:36] Oh, you know.
[00:45:36] In every,
[00:45:37] Any kind of training.
[00:45:38] Yeah, people are gonna get hurt.
[00:45:39] Like what in land warfare training?
[00:45:40] Like what ankle?
[00:45:41] Twisted ankle.
[00:45:42] Running.
[00:45:43] Hurt me.
[00:45:44] You're usually an ankle and you're a back, right?
[00:45:47] Oh, for.
[00:45:47] Picking up my buddy.
[00:45:48] Oh, yeah.
[00:45:49] Kind of especially when some people are running
[00:45:50] in land warfare.
[00:45:52] And there was a lot of buddy caring to be done.
[00:45:53] Sorry, fellas.
[00:45:55] Just trying to be ready for war.
[00:45:56] But,
[00:45:57] Yeah, people are gonna get injured.
[00:46:00] Here's another one like fast roping or parachuting.
[00:46:02] Like people break their ankle, people land wrong,
[00:46:04] people get hurt.
[00:46:05] So yeah, you're doing high risk training.
[00:46:07] People are gonna get hurt.
[00:46:09] Traumatic brain injury.
[00:46:12] The Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center study
[00:46:14] concluded that a relatively small percentage
[00:46:16] of 15.5% of combatives related injuries occur
[00:46:20] in the head, back, neck and nervous system.
[00:46:23] Dude, I don't think 15% is a small number.
[00:46:26] I don't like that number.
[00:46:27] However, these injuries can have disastrous consequences,
[00:46:30] which can include traumatic brain injuries.
[00:46:32] That's why you gotta spar.
[00:46:32] You can't spar every day.
[00:46:34] It'll be boxing every day.
[00:46:36] Oh, yeah.
[00:46:37] And for sure.
[00:46:38] That's something that we've learned
[00:46:39] and you and I had did not learn until it was too late
[00:46:42] because we already probably sparred hundreds of rounds
[00:46:45] back in the day live with MMA gloves, by the way,
[00:46:49] which is not smart.
[00:46:52] You can see better, you know?
[00:46:54] I mean, yeah.
[00:46:56] I mean, that's kind of disturbing.
[00:46:59] You know, when you think about all the rounds you did
[00:47:03] back in the day while training for camp,
[00:47:07] it is a lot of you getting punched in the head.
[00:47:09] Do you spar with MMA gloves just striking
[00:47:12] or is it a full?
[00:47:14] Both, usually take downs.
[00:47:15] But you know, you put Vaseline on or you put a,
[00:47:19] wear a headgear and small gloves
[00:47:21] or big gloves and no headgear.
[00:47:23] Yeah, depends.
[00:47:24] But that's, you know, we kind of evolved.
[00:47:27] And now it's evolved like God's spar a lot less.
[00:47:30] A lot less.
[00:47:32] Wasn't back when you were going through seal training,
[00:47:35] they put the boats on your head and jump on the boats.
[00:47:37] So like that.
[00:47:38] But now they don't do that.
[00:47:39] They don't do that anymore.
[00:47:40] Yeah, but see, you learn from the past
[00:47:41] because everyone has bad necks, jigs, you, pause, everyone.
[00:47:45] Sarge.
[00:47:46] Yeah, that wasn't healthy.
[00:47:48] Yeah, that was not healthy.
[00:47:49] You got a boat on your head
[00:47:50] and the freaking 220 pound instructor jumps into the boat.
[00:47:54] They put sand in it.
[00:47:55] And it's not like that moment of impact.
[00:47:58] The weight is distributed evenly amongst the six
[00:48:02] or seven heads in there.
[00:48:03] No, he lands wherever he lands.
[00:48:06] And it takes at least, you know, yeah, that was not good.
[00:48:10] And it feels like there's no real benefit
[00:48:12] in that kind of quote unquote training.
[00:48:14] Yeah, there is no benefit.
[00:48:16] It's only a negative.
[00:48:17] It's kind of like getting punched in the head.
[00:48:18] Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:19] Very.
[00:48:20] Now listen, you have to get punched a little bit.
[00:48:22] Yeah.
[00:48:22] So that you are used to it and you're not scared of it,
[00:48:24] but you don't get better at getting punched in the head.
[00:48:27] That's why we don't line people on walls
[00:48:28] and just start going ham on their face.
[00:48:30] You know those videos where guys line up on the wall
[00:48:32] and start just punching.
[00:48:33] Yeah.
[00:48:33] That's just freaking.
[00:48:35] Different tactics.
[00:48:36] That's not just different tactics.
[00:48:37] That's like freaking jerks.
[00:48:45] Traumatic brain injury occurs
[00:48:46] when a sudden trauma or a head injury
[00:48:48] disrupts the function of the brain,
[00:48:50] initiating the onset or worsening of the following symptoms,
[00:48:53] loss of or decreased level of consciousness,
[00:48:55] loss of memory for events immediately after altercation,
[00:48:59] alteration in mental state,
[00:49:01] confusion, disorientation,
[00:49:03] neurological deficits, weakness,
[00:49:06] loss of balance, change in vision.
[00:49:09] So you get a lot of these things
[00:49:12] if you're sparring all the time and you shouldn't.
[00:49:16] So don't.
[00:49:21] And it goes on to some more of this danger.
[00:49:25] Should a soldier exhibit any of the symptoms
[00:49:27] of traumatic brain injury?
[00:49:28] Soldiers should ask,
[00:49:29] should seek immediate emergency evaluation.
[00:49:31] This is how, I mean,
[00:49:32] remember when I got a really bad concussion from you?
[00:49:35] That's it.
[00:49:36] You felt like three or four.
[00:49:37] Yeah, but there was the worst one
[00:49:38] where I went actually had to go to the hospital.
[00:49:40] Yeah, I do call that, yeah.
[00:49:41] And I remember the doctor said,
[00:49:44] hey, you know, no contact for,
[00:49:47] I think she said six months.
[00:49:49] What happened?
[00:49:50] Which one was that?
[00:49:51] Did you hit on my knee or something?
[00:49:52] No.
[00:49:54] Oh, I shot.
[00:49:55] Yeah, it was a head.
[00:49:57] It was your head hitting my head.
[00:49:58] You sprawled and my head hit your chin.
[00:50:00] Yeah, okay.
[00:50:01] Yeah, and it didn't knock me out, knock me down.
[00:50:04] And then I was, remember I was looking up at the roof.
[00:50:06] Like I saw that the, the, the, the, I was like,
[00:50:09] why is Dean rotating me right now?
[00:50:11] Cause I feel like it.
[00:50:12] That's why.
[00:50:13] I was Dean cause he was across side and like,
[00:50:15] I'm looking up at the rafters and city boxing.
[00:50:16] Remember the city boxing had those big rafters
[00:50:18] and I'm looking at them and they're turning.
[00:50:19] And I'm like, I'm trying to put my feet to stop you
[00:50:22] from turning me, but it wasn't turning.
[00:50:24] I was turning you by the way.
[00:50:25] Yeah, no, you weren't.
[00:50:27] And then I woke up in the middle of the night,
[00:50:28] was throwing up and dizzy.
[00:50:29] I couldn't walk through the bathroom.
[00:50:31] And so I went to the hospital cause a boxer had just died.
[00:50:35] That's right.
[00:50:36] Yeah.
[00:50:36] A boxer had just died.
[00:50:37] And I was like, bro, I'm messed up.
[00:50:40] And one of my team guy friends came and drove me to the
[00:50:42] hospital cause I couldn't like, I was done.
[00:50:46] And, but here's the, here's done.
[00:50:50] Now here's dumb.
[00:50:51] She's like no contact for six months.
[00:50:53] And I was like, cool.
[00:50:54] Four weeks later, I was like, I think I'm good to go.
[00:50:57] Yeah.
[00:50:58] And I was, we were training again.
[00:50:59] Like doing that.
[00:51:01] So don't be stupid.
[00:51:02] Did you get amnesia or anything like that?
[00:51:04] No.
[00:51:05] No, I didn't.
[00:51:07] I got a concussion from football.
[00:51:08] I think I told you this where I got amnesia straight up.
[00:51:10] Woke up like, not well, I was conscious, but I woke up, you
[00:51:14] know, you come to the amnesia or whatever, just confused.
[00:51:17] Same deal.
[00:51:18] No contact.
[00:51:18] But they were like, well, it's your first concussion.
[00:51:21] The next week I played a game.
[00:51:24] The first hit I took another amnesia scenario.
[00:51:26] It was like, I don't know where I am or whatever.
[00:51:28] That's why they have concussion protocol now and all this stuff.
[00:51:31] They didn't used to have that back in the day when you were
[00:51:33] over there at Kauai High.
[00:51:35] Yeah.
[00:51:35] I had probably about 10 serious ones, but one of them
[00:51:38] after Japan, I fought a runner.
[00:51:41] I went to Spain, like, Rathwards, and I was like a 12-year-old kid.
[00:51:44] Like, I had the mental capacity of about a 12-year-old kid.
[00:51:49] I was like, hey, I didn't do it.
[00:51:50] And I would just do it.
[00:51:51] I was very, I don't know, for about two weeks.
[00:51:54] Yeah.
[00:51:55] Did you felt out of it or was it just?
[00:51:57] You know, I understand.
[00:51:59] I'm going to fall down, catch myself.
[00:52:01] So I was twice a day, so I was twice a week,
[00:52:03] and then I went down.
[00:52:04] Even like six months later, I got like one or two of those.
[00:52:06] Like, well, I got to sit down.
[00:52:08] But not for a long time.
[00:52:09] Not for a long time.
[00:52:09] You just like playing with Legos and stuff.
[00:52:11] Yeah.
[00:52:12] Coloring you.
[00:52:13] Damn, a chocolate.
[00:52:14] That's good time.
[00:52:15] Well-timed.
[00:52:15] But, Brian, they're like, hey, how long?
[00:52:18] Six months or whatever?
[00:52:20] Because, yeah, you feel better.
[00:52:21] Because even the next week, I felt better.
[00:52:23] I was like, bro, I'm not dizzy.
[00:52:24] I don't feel no pain or whatever, but like, your head is so weak now.
[00:52:27] So like, you could get like a small light,
[00:52:29] I got a light hit.
[00:52:30] It was a light hit.
[00:52:31] And I was just confused.
[00:52:32] Like, I don't even know where I am.
[00:52:33] Can they pull you out of the game then?
[00:52:34] Oh, yeah.
[00:52:35] Because you were just done.
[00:52:35] Everyone on the whole team knew I'm like,
[00:52:38] Brad's kind of scary, to be honest with you.
[00:52:40] Like, you don't know what's going on at all.
[00:52:42] And oh, yeah, they knew because I had it the week before.
[00:52:44] They pulled me out.
[00:52:45] Well, Dean, you've taken some shots in your MMA career.
[00:52:50] And you've never been knocked out in an MMA fight.
[00:52:54] Rocked out.
[00:52:55] I've been knocked out.
[00:52:55] You've been knocked down, but you've never been knocked out.
[00:52:58] I've watched some of your fights that I was actually at.
[00:53:01] And I still can't believe that you didn't get KO'd to next month.
[00:53:07] You're just like, oh, cool, whatever.
[00:53:08] I'm going to keep fighting you.
[00:53:09] That's the reason I don't look like Justin Bieber.
[00:53:13] I look a little bit different.
[00:53:16] All right.
[00:53:17] Let's be careful of traumatic brain injury.
[00:53:20] Chokes.
[00:53:21] Next section on jokes.
[00:53:21] Chokes are the most effective way to end a fight without a weapon.
[00:53:26] They incapacitate an enemy.
[00:53:28] With supervision, jokes can be applied in training exactly
[00:53:31] as a soldier would in the battlefield.
[00:53:33] Great.
[00:53:34] For training purposes, hold jokes only until your opponent taps.
[00:53:37] Holding a choke for lengthy periods may cause injury or death.
[00:53:41] OK.
[00:53:42] So this is one of the things we're dealing with.
[00:53:46] They have to say that.
[00:53:47] They have to say that.
[00:53:48] I know that's put.
[00:53:49] We have to say what?
[00:53:50] Like it could be injury.
[00:53:51] If you hold someone asleep for five minutes,
[00:53:54] but if someone goes to sleep, you let them go.
[00:53:57] They'll wake up.
[00:53:58] Now, there are certain substances that can actually
[00:54:01] interact with certain organs that can be dangerous.
[00:54:04] That's true.
[00:54:05] If someone has a medical condition, never know.
[00:54:09] But I swear, being choked out is safer than being knocked out.
[00:54:13] Oh, it's not.
[00:54:15] It's infinitely safer.
[00:54:17] It's infinitely safer.
[00:54:19] Now, if you have.
[00:54:19] Being choked out is painless.
[00:54:23] I would go so far as to say being choked out.
[00:54:27] Has no negative impact on your health.
[00:54:29] Yeah.
[00:54:30] No.
[00:54:31] Now, look, would you want to get choked out all day every day?
[00:54:33] No.
[00:54:33] But if you get choked out, 30 seconds later,
[00:54:37] you are totally viable to do anything that you need to do.
[00:54:42] With no impairment whatsoever.
[00:54:44] You get knocked out just like you said, Echo Charles.
[00:54:47] If someone gets knocked out, you are messed up.
[00:54:52] And you have probably some kind of permanent damage
[00:54:55] to your brain.
[00:54:57] Choked out?
[00:54:58] No factors for it.
[00:55:00] Would you compare being choked out to like your leg falling asleep?
[00:55:04] I'm sure anatomically and physiologically,
[00:55:06] there's a lot different.
[00:55:07] But yeah, probably something.
[00:55:08] You know, like your leg falls asleep.
[00:55:10] You're like, oh, and then it comes back.
[00:55:12] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:12] Then you're fine.
[00:55:13] That's what it feels like to be honest.
[00:55:15] Yeah, it's just it's horrible because law enforcement,
[00:55:20] actually at this point, there's so many law enforcement departments
[00:55:25] where the choke is illegal.
[00:55:28] Yeah, it's the same as shooting someone out.
[00:55:30] Yep, it's lethal force.
[00:55:32] And you will be charged.
[00:55:35] And when properly trained.
[00:55:38] Now look, if someone's improperly trained,
[00:55:40] there's a higher percentage that they might actually
[00:55:43] hurt somebody.
[00:55:44] True.
[00:55:45] But anyone that's properly trained, I mean, please,
[00:55:48] if you come to arrest me and I'm being a jerk
[00:55:50] because I'm on drugs or drunk or whatever.
[00:55:53] Choke me out.
[00:55:54] Please choke me.
[00:55:54] Don't shoot me.
[00:55:55] Don't shoot me and don't beat me in the head with a baton,
[00:55:58] right?
[00:55:59] Because that's going to mess me up permanently.
[00:56:01] Whereas you choke me out, you put me to sleep, put me in cuffs,
[00:56:04] I'll wake up sober up and I'll be like, yeah, I'm sorry, man.
[00:56:07] Whereas if you hit me in the head with a baton six times,
[00:56:10] which is what it's going to take to knock me out,
[00:56:12] I'm going to wake up.
[00:56:13] I'm going to be messed up.
[00:56:14] I'm going to have cuts all over my head.
[00:56:16] Stitches, yeah.
[00:56:17] Stitches, brain damage of some kind.
[00:56:21] I'm going to sue everybody.
[00:56:23] I'm going to be, it's just a disaster.
[00:56:26] Where's he put me to sleep?
[00:56:27] Last night on 99 Rear Naked Choke?
[00:56:30] It's a terrible thing.
[00:56:32] It's a terrible thing that that's been demonized the way it has.
[00:56:36] And look, there's been some cases where clearly it
[00:56:38] was a freaking major problem because a chokehold got put on,
[00:56:41] held for too long, put on by someone that was panicked
[00:56:45] or otherwise freaking out.
[00:56:47] And it was the wrong move to make and the training
[00:56:51] wasn't there to let a person realize, oh,
[00:56:53] this person's unconscious.
[00:56:54] Now I need to let him go.
[00:56:55] Yeah, true.
[00:56:57] And no one was detached enough to be like, hey,
[00:56:59] you that person's subdued.
[00:57:01] Now you can let him go.
[00:57:05] But that's jokes.
[00:57:07] What did you write down to you?
[00:57:08] No, I was just, I was saying like, you know,
[00:57:11] about the illusions of, well, I mean, it's you see, you know,
[00:57:16] so if you have me in a chokehold, I'll bite your arm
[00:57:18] or I'll poke your eyes.
[00:57:20] And truth is, you get a high level black belt
[00:57:22] and they have a choke and try to actually start,
[00:57:25] start with my arm in your mouth if you want.
[00:57:27] Your teeth will, it won't shatter, but you will stop biting me.
[00:57:32] Or you'll reach back from my eyes.
[00:57:33] You have three seconds to go to sleep.
[00:57:34] I can hide my eyes too.
[00:57:35] And the eyes are not like jello.
[00:57:37] I mean, they're very sensitive, but I mean,
[00:57:40] it's just funny people think, oh, you know, that's your C.
[00:57:43] We're gonna try to just reach back to focus eyes.
[00:57:45] That's annoying.
[00:57:46] It pissed me off actually.
[00:57:47] You saw that video with Boss Rootin.
[00:57:48] Yeah, you know, with the chokehold,
[00:57:50] reach back from my eyes or reach for the groin.
[00:57:53] So these are targets or opportunity.
[00:57:55] You have to include that as a possibility, right?
[00:57:57] But I'm saying like, just the thought of,
[00:57:59] here's a quick ease, we have the choke,
[00:58:00] just reach back for the eyes.
[00:58:01] No, it's not that easy because if they know
[00:58:03] what they're doing, they're squeezing,
[00:58:04] you're taking three seconds, you're sleeping.
[00:58:05] You're sleeping.
[00:58:06] And you're not getting their eyes out in three seconds.
[00:58:08] You might scratch your eyelid.
[00:58:10] I've had people try to gouge my eyes out before
[00:58:12] and it's ineffective compared to a choke.
[00:58:14] They're going to sleep.
[00:58:15] It'll kind of piss me off.
[00:58:16] I choke you a little harder.
[00:58:17] I choke harder.
[00:58:19] Bite my arm right through your teeth.
[00:58:20] You know, it's just stuff like that.
[00:58:21] It sounds brutal.
[00:58:22] It is brutal, but don't bite my arm.
[00:58:24] You know what I'm saying?
[00:58:24] So yeah, so that, so there's a happy medium
[00:58:26] of including that as a possibility,
[00:58:28] but not really, I don't think that that is a quick fix.
[00:58:30] It's just something to include in your training.
[00:58:34] Joint locks, attacks on most large joints,
[00:58:37] for example, elbow, shoulder and knee are painful
[00:58:40] long before causing injuries,
[00:58:42] which allows soldiers to conduct full force training
[00:58:45] without significant risk of injury.
[00:58:47] The exceptions are wrist attacks and twisting knee attacks.
[00:58:51] Therefore these attacks should be taught with great care
[00:58:54] and should not be allowed during sparring.
[00:58:57] That's interesting.
[00:58:58] Pete the Greek disagrees, 100%.
[00:59:00] Yeah.
[00:59:02] The way we do jockeau echo myself,
[00:59:04] what they're talking about is something known as a told
[00:59:06] or a heel look to twist your heel or your foot,
[00:59:10] but the consequences of your knee twist usually depends
[00:59:12] on if you have a strong knee and a weak ankle.
[00:59:14] Your ankle might pop first.
[00:59:15] Now these kind of things done responsibly
[00:59:17] can be done in training as long as you catch a release.
[00:59:20] Also your partner has to know
[00:59:21] and not turn the wrong way and hurt themselves.
[00:59:22] So I think they should be included in training,
[00:59:24] but I see a white belt, you know,
[00:59:25] teaching my heel look can go hard because yeah,
[00:59:28] with a boot on a military boot,
[00:59:29] you can just grab the boot and twist it.
[00:59:30] You don't need to get a heel look, you know,
[00:59:31] they can just grab your boot.
[00:59:32] So with the boots on, leg lock city, bro.
[00:59:35] Yeah.
[00:59:37] It is with heel hooks,
[00:59:40] heel hooks do not hurt until you're injured.
[00:59:42] Right at the edge, yeah.
[00:59:43] Yeah, right at the edge.
[00:59:44] Right, but I actually hurt someone with a heel hook.
[00:59:50] I was a blue belt and I was training with a friend of mine
[00:59:53] who's a seal, who's all amped up
[00:59:57] and I put a heel hook on and I did,
[01:00:00] I put it on to a point where I was like,
[01:00:02] oh, you know, whatever, he's not tapping
[01:00:06] and I think I just like let it go or whatever,
[01:00:08] but it hurt him.
[01:00:09] So, and he didn't really feel the pain from it.
[01:00:12] I went to something else.
[01:00:14] So it is a thing and you do need to pay attention to that,
[01:00:17] that heel hooks really don't hurt that much
[01:00:20] until you're injured.
[01:00:25] Wrist locks.
[01:00:26] Yeah, there's also that.
[01:00:27] That's weird.
[01:00:28] I don't know why, is that included?
[01:00:31] There's many bones in the, you know,
[01:00:32] the hand is, it's all these bones together
[01:00:33] and there's certain little pop could be this one bone
[01:00:37] and this one, this one little, like,
[01:00:38] Dr. Luke would, you know,
[01:00:40] has over the hands, human hand, obviously,
[01:00:42] but it could be this little knuckle,
[01:00:44] it could be the finger, you get me,
[01:00:46] it could be that finger, it could be,
[01:00:47] so a little pressure could pop a finger.
[01:00:50] Yeah, so that's what they mean.
[01:00:52] They are effective though,
[01:00:52] there's some really effective wrist locks.
[01:00:55] Generally speaking on the ground,
[01:00:56] there's not a lot of very effective standing wrist locks
[01:00:59] against a trained opponent at least.
[01:01:00] Because there's the,
[01:01:01] because the opponent has a lot of mobility.
[01:01:02] Yes, yes, you need to isolate one of the major limbs,
[01:01:05] the neck or one of the arms.
[01:01:06] So you control next to the trunk of the body,
[01:01:08] is what I'm saying.
[01:01:08] Yeah.
[01:01:09] You know how like the heel hook, right?
[01:01:12] You don't really feel it until like,
[01:01:13] kind of too late scenario, right?
[01:01:15] What about knee bars?
[01:01:16] In your experience, same deal?
[01:01:18] Kimura is worse than a straight knee lock.
[01:01:20] Kimura is what the pain.
[01:01:21] The twisting, the twisting motion,
[01:01:23] if you're, if you're on bops in a Kimura,
[01:01:25] it could be a problem.
[01:01:26] If your knee pops from a straight, I mean,
[01:01:28] you know, you'd be sore.
[01:01:29] Now, if you don't tap at all and it does break,
[01:01:31] and then it's of course serious injury,
[01:01:32] but the straight knee lock,
[01:01:34] you feel the pain right away.
[01:01:35] But your question about the pain level.
[01:01:37] Yeah, exactly, right?
[01:01:38] The pain level in a straight knee lock is there.
[01:01:40] Yeah, for sure.
[01:01:41] You don't tap, yeah.
[01:01:42] I've had my knee pop from a knee bar,
[01:01:45] didn't feel it, even when it popped,
[01:01:47] I didn't really feel it that much.
[01:01:48] I knew there was something wrong.
[01:01:50] You're so athletic.
[01:01:50] Seriously, running your whole life,
[01:01:52] maybe that's the reason, running, running, running,
[01:01:53] you lose a lot of the nerves in your knee.
[01:01:55] Yeah, it's very possible, yes.
[01:01:57] Cause it did swell up.
[01:01:58] I didn't like, I didn't.
[01:01:59] I was gonna say, was it actually injured though?
[01:02:01] It was like,
[01:02:02] cause you have those weird knees too that sometimes make a noise
[01:02:04] for no reason.
[01:02:05] They pop out, yeah.
[01:02:06] Yeah, and that's a good point.
[01:02:08] It probably was that, it was swollen for,
[01:02:10] I don't know, a week, two weeks maybe,
[01:02:12] which actually technically as far as compared to a real knee
[01:02:14] injury is not that much time, I don't know.
[01:02:16] So was I injured?
[01:02:18] Moderately injured.
[01:02:20] But it did swell up,
[01:02:21] and I think it was just a meniscus situation.
[01:02:23] But I didn't feel it though.
[01:02:25] It wasn't painful.
[01:02:26] That's strange.
[01:02:27] So yeah, it could be like a unique thing.
[01:02:29] Like I'm sure with the arm lock,
[01:02:30] that next day the arms swell up,
[01:02:31] then it tap, yeah.
[01:02:32] But the knee is a little more serious,
[01:02:33] but it's not as bad as a Kimura.
[01:02:34] A Kimura, if you get an injury from a Kimura,
[01:02:37] it's a little worse than a straight knee lock, generally.
[01:02:39] Twisting, your look is different.
[01:02:40] Yeah, well your shoulders are more complex, joint.
[01:02:44] Twisting.
[01:02:45] What have you, you got knee surgeries pretty early.
[01:02:48] Yeah.
[01:02:49] Didn't you Dean Lister?
[01:02:50] 97 and 2001.
[01:02:51] How old were you?
[01:02:52] I must have been 20, 21.
[01:02:55] And what was the first injury?
[01:02:57] It was from high school football.
[01:02:58] I got hit from the side.
[01:02:59] My knee was on, someone was on there,
[01:03:01] like they already got knocked down.
[01:03:03] They were on their hands and knees,
[01:03:04] and my knee got propped up against the ribs.
[01:03:06] I didn't see them.
[01:03:07] I'm pursuing down line, I was a linebacker.
[01:03:09] And so I hit from the right side,
[01:03:10] and I twisted over, just perfect.
[01:03:12] You know, I didn't see the guy.
[01:03:13] I saw the video, my knee planted on his side,
[01:03:16] and I got hit from the right.
[01:03:17] It just popped right over.
[01:03:18] So was it, oh, ACL?
[01:03:19] ACL, the LCL, and the meniscus medial,
[01:03:23] or the medial, or a lot of other meniscus.
[01:03:24] So you got the triple front surgery?
[01:03:26] Bucket handle, Terry, that's what they call it.
[01:03:28] But yeah.
[01:03:29] And then the doctor was like, yeah, knee surgery,
[01:03:31] but you have a strong knee capsule.
[01:03:33] I'm like, what does that mean?
[01:03:34] Well, right now you're okay kind of,
[01:03:36] but that eventually just came out.
[01:03:37] James Nielsen had a triangle.
[01:03:39] I was in a full squat, just came out one time on the mat in 97,
[01:03:43] and then I got surgery.
[01:03:44] And then you got the needed surgery.
[01:03:45] I always kind of forgot that you got surgery in 97,
[01:03:49] and that most of your career was post knee surgery.
[01:03:52] And I think I shot off the Ron Bergen for,
[01:03:53] I had an appointment for them,
[01:03:54] and my insurance lapsed just like a week after that.
[01:03:57] So I had full.
[01:03:59] Yeah, sweet.
[01:04:00] So I got, yeah, thanks to Ron Bergen, my friend.
[01:04:02] Yeah, he took the job.
[01:04:04] You got lucky on that one.
[01:04:05] Lucky, that's a expensive thing.
[01:04:07] Yeah, and then you got another one in 2001?
[01:04:09] Yeah, but that was just a meniscus.
[01:04:11] That's just a shaving, yeah, meniscus.
[01:04:13] 2001, 2003 was a good year for me in Brazil.
[01:04:16] 2001, I was, you know, three weeks,
[01:04:18] mdm'd up, not a big deal.
[01:04:19] And then you got shoulder surgery.
[01:04:22] Shoulder surgery, I had five solo surgeries
[01:04:24] in a year and a half, yeah.
[01:04:27] That's not fun.
[01:04:28] Because I had an infection in Brazil,
[01:04:29] in that Brazil, I have an infection, you know?
[01:04:32] A really bad, serious infection.
[01:04:33] Like they were even saying in Portuguese,
[01:04:35] like, hey, we're not saying you might get your arm cut off,
[01:04:37] but you know, it could happen.
[01:04:38] I'm like, bro, when a doctor says,
[01:04:41] yeah, that's bad.
[01:04:42] They're kind of like, but they're telling you for a reason.
[01:04:44] So, yeah.
[01:04:45] So, yeah, but I think I'm actually.
[01:04:46] What surgery was that?
[01:04:47] Like the original problem, what was it?
[01:04:49] It was my medial, my infraspinatus,
[01:04:52] my sub scapularis, and my labrum and my rototocuff,
[01:04:55] which was all ripped up from all the competitions I've had.
[01:04:58] Also in Russia, broke, broken Russia, snapped.
[01:05:01] That's just a bad arm.
[01:05:02] That's all, but it's okay, right?
[01:05:04] Surgery's happy.
[01:05:05] We have a lot of overlapping injuries.
[01:05:08] Even actually, I tore my knee,
[01:05:11] kind of real similar in a similar way the year before.
[01:05:14] 96, yeah?
[01:05:15] Football, same deal.
[01:05:17] And you're bicep too?
[01:05:18] Yeah, the bicep.
[01:05:19] In fact, one of our surgeries was on the same day.
[01:05:22] We ran into each other.
[01:05:23] Did you know that?
[01:05:24] Yeah, I go in for the surgery.
[01:05:26] And the doctor's like, oh yeah, Dean's here.
[01:05:28] I was like, what?
[01:05:29] And then he's like coming to after his surgery.
[01:05:31] He's like, wait, who was the doctor?
[01:05:32] Were he like, do you guys?
[01:05:33] Well, yeah, because you said, when I first tore my bicep,
[01:05:38] it was after you tore yours.
[01:05:39] It was at a different time.
[01:05:40] So when I tore mine, I was like, hey, who's your guy?
[01:05:43] Like who did you go to?
[01:05:44] Because he was back in the game.
[01:05:46] So I was like, let me go to that guy.
[01:05:48] So it was Norman Cain.
[01:05:49] Yeah, that's right.
[01:05:49] And so I went to him and then he passed me up.
[01:05:52] He's like, oh, Dean's here?
[01:05:54] No, no, no, that was the first one.
[01:05:55] The second, or when I ran into him was the second one.
[01:05:58] What if I'm being real?
[01:05:59] I'm like, yeah, go, don't do it.
[01:06:01] Don't trust him.
[01:06:01] I would have trusted him if I was you.
[01:06:04] You've only torn one bicep, haven't you, Dean?
[01:06:06] Oh, well, yeah, it was complete tear, though.
[01:06:08] Just rolled up my shoulder.
[01:06:09] You were there when that rolled up my shoulder.
[01:06:11] I was there too.
[01:06:11] I had two shoulders.
[01:06:12] No bicep.
[01:06:13] You were two shoulders.
[01:06:14] I'm just being a bit rude.
[01:06:15] I remember Robert Garcia, we were back together.
[01:06:17] I was like, I don't know, but yeah, that's bad surgery.
[01:06:21] But the second one, it was like nine years later
[01:06:23] when you got your other surgery on your shoulder bicep.
[01:06:26] It was like, he had a big surgery.
[01:06:29] So I went and Norman Cain did yours, right?
[01:06:31] That one.
[01:06:31] But I didn't get it from Norman.
[01:06:33] Norman Cain didn't do mine.
[01:06:33] It was the other guy.
[01:06:34] It was like his partner guy or whatever.
[01:06:37] But I saw that's who told me when I walked in,
[01:06:39] it was Norman Cain and he was like, oh, what's up, man?
[01:06:42] Dean's here.
[01:06:42] And he was like, no, we finished already.
[01:06:44] So then he's like, you know when you come.
[01:06:47] That's a bad sign for Jiu-Jitsu when you let go
[01:06:49] to get surgery and your other friends
[01:06:51] or they're getting surgery as well.
[01:06:52] Another guy's there too.
[01:06:53] Yeah, not a good sign.
[01:06:55] 100% Rika, how is your arm?
[01:06:58] It's getting strong.
[01:06:59] It's rehab and progress, you know, so I'll be okay.
[01:07:04] Yeah, check.
[01:07:06] It actually has a protocol.
[01:07:07] Like I said, the army doesn't miss anything.
[01:07:09] Protocol for injured soldiers.
[01:07:11] You know, it's got everything in here.
[01:07:13] It also says that striking is not the most efficient way
[01:07:16] to incapacitate an enemy and often results
[01:07:19] in injury to the striker.
[01:07:22] So this is like a pro grappling statement.
[01:07:25] Not only is it not the most efficient way,
[01:07:27] but I'm probably gonna get hurt too.
[01:07:28] Choco, the old school boxers, apparently,
[01:07:31] no gloves would punch the body more.
[01:07:33] That's why the hands were done here.
[01:07:34] Because punching the forehead back in those days,
[01:07:36] your hands broken now, you're like, eh,
[01:07:39] you know, probably retired now.
[01:07:40] Or you're not gonna go into the job at the factory now.
[01:07:44] These guys actually worked at the time.
[01:07:45] So the rumor, actually, I don't remember,
[01:07:47] pretty much known with the 1800s.
[01:07:49] It was like the hands were low
[01:07:50] because you were punching more of the body.
[01:07:52] Face, yeah, but you're taking a chance to the face.
[01:07:54] So there we go.
[01:07:55] I mean, they knew it back and then they didn't have
[01:07:57] the same medical care we do now.
[01:07:58] And there's reason they were hands low.
[01:08:01] Yeah, they actually keep them in,
[01:08:02] tucked to their sides a little bit.
[01:08:03] They'll prevent those body shots.
[01:08:05] And yet further out in front of them,
[01:08:07] so they maybe can get up and defend the face a little bit
[01:08:09] if they need to.
[01:08:10] That's interesting.
[01:08:13] It does say however striking is important part
[01:08:15] of overall strife fight strategy,
[01:08:16] strikes can be very effective in manipulating the opponent
[01:08:19] into unfavorable positions.
[01:08:20] Striking can be practiced
[01:08:21] with various types of protective padding,
[01:08:22] such as gloves.
[01:08:23] Defense can be practiced using reduced force blows.
[01:08:26] So there you go.
[01:08:28] Talks about like, I mean,
[01:08:31] this is such a detailed document
[01:08:34] and the army just does this, man.
[01:08:35] The army is squared away when it comes to doctrine.
[01:08:37] They make them just incredibly detailed things
[01:08:40] and this team obviously put a huge amount into this.
[01:08:46] Talking about training.
[01:08:48] The military profession is inherently dangerous.
[01:08:51] Commanders must train their units to tough standards
[01:08:53] under the most realistic conditions possible.
[01:08:58] This chapter discusses the combatives training program
[01:09:01] from an institutional training to operational unit training,
[01:09:05] training areas, training techniques, teaching techniques
[01:09:07] and safety precautions that must be considered
[01:09:09] before conducting combatives training.
[01:09:10] And they just go, they get after it in this thing.
[01:09:14] I mean, this is like, if you didn't know anything
[01:09:18] about anything, you could pick up this manual
[01:09:20] and start to piece together, you know?
[01:09:22] Deliberate work risk assessment worksheet.
[01:09:25] It is vital to identify necessary risk
[01:09:27] by comparing potential benefit to potential loss.
[01:09:29] The draw process allows units to identify
[01:09:31] and control hazards, conserve combat power
[01:09:33] and resources and complete the mission.
[01:09:35] This process is cyclic and continuous.
[01:09:37] It must be integrated into all phases
[01:09:39] of operations and training.
[01:09:41] Like these guys are just,
[01:09:42] they're not even playing around with us.
[01:09:44] And then go, what do you got, Dean?
[01:09:45] No, I was just saying, like,
[01:09:47] I like how this is structured.
[01:09:48] I really like it a lot because you need to have a guideline
[01:09:50] especially in the military.
[01:09:51] I think it's really good.
[01:09:52] You're doing a good job so far.
[01:09:53] For us, they're very complete.
[01:09:54] One thing that I think is very important
[01:09:56] as far as training on your own,
[01:09:57] if you're in the military or if you're under
[01:09:59] some certain guidance like this is,
[01:10:01] there has to be some wiggle room, some leeway,
[01:10:03] such as also a move that I don't even do that well,
[01:10:06] but I know my students do well.
[01:10:08] Like, remember, Eric had a better darsen than me.
[01:10:11] Maybe I taught at them though.
[01:10:12] So there's certain things I'll teach
[01:10:14] that would not be under my guideline,
[01:10:16] but I teach because some people do those moves naturally well.
[01:10:19] Some people I wouldn't strive,
[01:10:20] I wouldn't teach, I'll teach in the triangle,
[01:10:22] but that's it, the legs are not very long.
[01:10:23] It's not gonna be their main move,
[01:10:24] but they don't learn it anyways.
[01:10:25] Someone else is gonna be, that's gonna be their move.
[01:10:28] So I think it's really important we have the guideline,
[01:10:29] but there's also has to be some wiggle room.
[01:10:31] That's why it's important to train in your own free time
[01:10:34] to find your own style.
[01:10:35] I think it's really important for Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:10:37] Yeah, you don't wanna learn by the book only.
[01:10:40] It's good to have guidelines.
[01:10:41] Yeah, it's gotta have the guidelines,
[01:10:42] but you gotta get out there.
[01:10:43] I think it goes through the whole thing
[01:10:44] of like how the basic combatives course of instruction,
[01:10:47] there's a BCC instruction and what that does
[01:10:50] and what that includes.
[01:10:52] And then tactical combatives course
[01:10:54] and what that's all about and what that includes.
[01:10:56] And then you get them combatives master trainer course
[01:10:59] of instruction, the CMTC.
[01:11:03] This addresses all ranges of the fight
[01:11:05] by training striking skills and introduces soldiers
[01:11:07] to the integrating combatives training
[01:11:09] into the rest of their warrior tasks and drills,
[01:11:12] IE incorporating combatives into training,
[01:11:15] close quarters combat training and mission unit training.
[01:11:18] And then it goes over duties of the combatives
[01:11:23] master trainer course certified instructors.
[01:11:27] And it says everything that they have to do.
[01:11:29] And there's a whole list of things that they have to do
[01:11:32] to be like a master trainer in this stuff.
[01:11:36] They went to great lengths to get this program.
[01:11:41] And you know, a lot of this, I bet was they,
[01:11:46] you gotta play the game in the military.
[01:11:48] You know, you gotta play the game.
[01:11:50] You gotta give the leadership what it is
[01:11:52] that they need to say, yeah, we, yep.
[01:11:56] Oh, this is, I bet you they pulled out like some
[01:11:59] immediate action drill rifle training guidebook
[01:12:01] and said, all right, we're gonna put all the stuff
[01:12:03] that's in here about safety, we're gonna put it in here.
[01:12:05] And they did an awesome job of setting this up
[01:12:08] where it's kind of hard, hard for the leadership
[01:12:10] to say, well, you guys really haven't fought this through.
[01:12:12] It's like, oh no, we fought this through
[01:12:14] to the freaking nth degree.
[01:12:16] Yeah, here's some of the stuff
[01:12:18] that the combatives instructor has to do.
[01:12:23] Receive at least 20 hours of instruction,
[01:12:25] gain the ability to teach basic combatives
[01:12:26] and develop scenario-based training
[01:12:28] and understand standard competition roles.
[01:12:30] Pass a hands-on performance-oriented test
[01:12:33] on basic combatives techniques,
[01:12:35] including the following maneuvers.
[01:12:37] Escape the mount, trap and roll, pass the guard,
[01:12:39] achieve mount from side control, arm push and roll
[01:12:42] to the rear mount, escape rear mount, escape the mount,
[01:12:44] shrimp to the guard, scissor sweep, rear naked choke,
[01:12:46] cross collar choke from the mount or guard,
[01:12:48] bend arm bar, straight arm bar from the guard,
[01:12:50] straight arm bar from the mount, sweep and attempt
[01:12:54] the straight arm, sweep from the attempted
[01:12:56] straight arm bar, close the gap and achieve the clinch,
[01:12:58] take down from the front to the mount, rear take down,
[01:13:01] front guillotine choke.
[01:13:03] Guillotine choke, sorry.
[01:13:05] Guillotine.
[01:13:06] Guillotine, poor.
[01:13:07] Pass a written exam on the combatives program
[01:13:10] and standard combatives rules,
[01:13:13] conduct at least one scenario-based training exercise
[01:13:17] and receive an additional 20-hour training.
[01:13:18] So they've got everything, like that's what you need to do.
[01:13:21] Right?
[01:13:22] So that's, this is as thorough as you could hope for.
[01:13:26] They forgot the spinning, jumping,
[01:13:28] double reverse, inverted, upside down.
[01:13:33] We'll plot that, but other than that.
[01:13:34] And you know, we had Tim Kennedy on
[01:13:36] and he was talking about, he's the three-time,
[01:13:39] the three-time army combatives champion.
[01:13:43] And when he won, he won it twice
[01:13:44] and he was the only person that had won it twice
[01:13:46] and then he won it three times.
[01:13:47] But that's just an awesome competition.
[01:13:49] And it's grueling what they do.
[01:13:51] It's like multiple fights.
[01:13:53] And the rules kind of escalate as you go through.
[01:13:56] I think like the first day,
[01:13:57] when they're just trying to weed people out,
[01:13:58] it's just like grappling only.
[01:14:00] Yeah.
[01:14:00] And then the next day is like grappling with
[01:14:03] strikes on the ground or something like this.
[01:14:05] And then like the finals is just basically MMA
[01:14:08] and the freaking fatigue's on, right?
[01:14:11] That's freaking legit, man.
[01:14:13] And there's, everybody shows up to that thing.
[01:14:16] It's the army, right?
[01:14:18] Freaking legit.
[01:14:20] Outstanding way to figure out where people are at.
[01:14:23] And then it gets into like unit training.
[01:14:28] And a successful unit combatist program
[01:14:30] continued to focus on the core techniques
[01:14:31] taught to soldiers during the international military training.
[01:14:33] Mastery of these moves, not exposure to a large number
[01:14:35] of techniques will result in more proficient fighters.
[01:14:38] For unit combat is training to be successful.
[01:14:40] It must become an integral part of the unit's culture.
[01:14:43] Successful unit combat is programs
[01:14:44] have four characteristics.
[01:14:45] Training for every soldier,
[01:14:47] set standards and hold people accountable for them,
[01:14:50] motivate soldiers and leaders to achieve excellence,
[01:14:52] integrate combatives into mission training.
[01:14:54] So I think like that's the kind of thing
[01:14:58] that statement right there.
[01:14:59] This is what law enforcement needs to look at.
[01:15:02] Yeah.
[01:15:03] Combatives training for everyone.
[01:15:04] They need to do it all the time.
[01:15:06] It needs to be part of mission training.
[01:15:07] And I've been going around saying for the last couple of years
[01:15:10] that I think law enforcement should be training
[01:15:12] 20% of their time, 20% of the time that you're at work
[01:15:17] as law enforcement, you should be getting trained.
[01:15:20] But I think it was interesting
[01:15:20] because Jocko, we talked about this personally
[01:15:23] about law enforcement.
[01:15:24] You're like, you've done vehicle interdiction.
[01:15:26] You've actually done it in wartime scenarios at night.
[01:15:29] And the thing is, I'd rather get arrested by Jocko than,
[01:15:33] actually no.
[01:15:34] Other people would prefer to get arrested by Jocko
[01:15:38] than someone else who doesn't know Jiu Jitsu.
[01:15:40] So the thing is, yeah, it's not always nice of me.
[01:15:44] I'm also not that nice back, by the way, to be fair.
[01:15:47] But I think it's going to be, is that extreme?
[01:15:50] I think the idea of human confrontation,
[01:15:55] just being used that more and more.
[01:15:57] I mean, how do you get debate skills
[01:15:59] without getting into, you're not getting argument,
[01:16:01] not falling argument,
[01:16:01] but you actually have to get into the debate itself.
[01:16:03] You can just talk by yourself or get in the debate
[01:16:05] with someone else to get skills like that.
[01:16:07] So I think it's a good point, plus you get in shape.
[01:16:10] Yeah, so let me ask you this question.
[01:16:13] Picture you have 10 police officers.
[01:16:17] Yeah.
[01:16:17] And there's a scenario that's unfolding.
[01:16:22] And one of the groups of 10 is like normal police officers
[01:16:26] today and they have the normal four hours per year
[01:16:30] of defensive tactics and combatives.
[01:16:33] But you have all 10 of them versus another department
[01:16:38] that is training 20% of their time has spent training.
[01:16:41] So, and they've been for a year,
[01:16:43] have been spent 20% of their time training.
[01:16:45] And there's a call, some emergency situation.
[01:16:49] There's somebody going crazy with a knife.
[01:16:53] There's a domestic violence scenario
[01:16:57] where a guy's on PCP and he's freaking out.
[01:17:01] And, or you come home to your house
[01:17:03] and there's like something bad is happening at your house.
[01:17:06] Who do you want to show up?
[01:17:09] That is it, do you want the 10 people,
[01:17:12] the 10 police officers that have had four hours of training
[01:17:14] each, so 40 hours of training,
[01:17:16] or do you want only eight?
[01:17:18] Because two of these guys are actually
[01:17:20] on their training right now, they're not working.
[01:17:22] So you only get eight, but that eight
[01:17:25] has trained hundreds of hours over the last year
[01:17:27] to prepare for all these different scenarios.
[01:17:29] There's no doubt who, anyone would pick.
[01:17:32] Anyone would pick.
[01:17:33] Well, that time could be a lot of better study of law.
[01:17:35] It could be a lot more for, I don't know,
[01:17:37] marksmanship, could be a lot more.
[01:17:38] They're stupid if they say that.
[01:17:39] It could be a lot more for counseling sessions.
[01:17:43] I mean, the thing is we're talking about human confrontation
[01:17:45] and I think how to deescalate because in Jitsu,
[01:17:48] it's not always about me being stronger than you,
[01:17:49] it's about me finding a way around.
[01:17:51] Yeah, and it's also,
[01:17:52] and also that training is not necessarily,
[01:17:55] it's not all combat, it's not all shooting.
[01:17:58] You will be taking deescalation.
[01:18:00] Hey, how do you deal with someone that's,
[01:18:01] oh, you can tell they're clearly angry,
[01:18:03] it's a domestic violence situation,
[01:18:04] the guy's freaking out, what are you gonna do?
[01:18:06] Hey, you need to settle down.
[01:18:07] And that's like, no, that's not gonna work out well.
[01:18:10] Yeah.
[01:18:11] You need to, hey, keep some distance, talk to them.
[01:18:13] You can, so you're gonna get trained
[01:18:15] in all these different aspects,
[01:18:16] it's not just training on shooting and fighting,
[01:18:18] it's training on how to deescalate,
[01:18:19] how to get control, how to set things up,
[01:18:22] what psychological maneuvers can you make
[01:18:24] to get someone to calm down?
[01:18:25] Like all those things are what you need to get trained in.
[01:18:28] So the fact that I hear the excuse of like,
[01:18:32] well, you need the police out,
[01:18:33] no, untrained police have less value,
[01:18:37] way less value than trained police, not even close.
[01:18:41] And you know, that was another thing
[01:18:42] where I was having some of those discussions
[01:18:44] and arguments while I was in the SEAL teams about,
[01:18:47] hey, this system that we're using right now,
[01:18:49] the guys are trained up in five days.
[01:18:51] The system that you're talking about would take years,
[01:18:53] you know, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[01:18:55] 10 years to get proficient at.
[01:18:59] And I remember, I think it was like,
[01:19:00] occasionally you get a good comeback or whatever.
[01:19:03] I was like, well, you're in the teams for 20.
[01:19:05] So why not get good at it?
[01:19:07] You know, why would you expect someone to get good
[01:19:09] in five days at something that takes a lifetime
[01:19:11] to get good at?
[01:19:11] And by the way, you're in the SEAL teams for 20 years,
[01:19:13] at least, well, I guess you could be for less.
[01:19:15] No, I'm just kidding.
[01:19:16] But most guys, most guys are in it
[01:19:17] for four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 20, 25 years.
[01:19:21] Let's get good at this thing.
[01:19:25] So that's the unit training and they talk about standards
[01:19:28] and they talk about making it part of your physical training.
[01:19:31] Yeah.
[01:19:32] Right?
[01:19:33] If you're gonna train, that's another thing.
[01:19:34] Like police officers, that 20% of time
[01:19:38] that should be spent training, that includes,
[01:19:40] like, how are you getting in shape?
[01:19:42] Are you in shape?
[01:19:43] I want to be in shape if you're caught.
[01:19:44] Oh my God.
[01:19:46] You know, you see these, you see these,
[01:19:48] some of these videos of police officers
[01:19:52] and you're thinking, wait a second,
[01:19:54] how is this person gonna stop anybody
[01:19:56] that's remotely athletic, even if I just run away?
[01:19:59] How are you gonna catch anybody?
[01:20:02] Yeah.
[01:20:03] And you know, this whole thing, you know,
[01:20:04] that we did a podcast on the Uvaldi situation
[01:20:07] and it's just, what else needs to happen in America
[01:20:12] to realize that we need more training?
[01:20:14] And by the way, that Uvaldi situation,
[01:20:19] the fact that people didn't respond
[01:20:22] and acted in a cowardly manner is also part of training.
[01:20:28] It's also part of training,
[01:20:30] because you learn like, oh, if I don't do something aggressive,
[01:20:33] then I'm gonna get caught.
[01:20:35] I'm gonna look bad, I'm gonna be bad,
[01:20:37] I'm gonna, the culture changes.
[01:20:40] If you have a culture, and I used to see this
[01:20:41] with seal platoons, if you had a culture that like,
[01:20:43] you had some of these seal platoons coming through
[01:20:45] and they were like ready to take on the world.
[01:20:47] And you throw some scenario at them,
[01:20:48] they were going on the attack.
[01:20:51] And that's a culture that happens.
[01:20:53] You have another seal platoon where it's like,
[01:20:55] well, we're cautious, we have a zero defect policy,
[01:20:58] we don't wanna get in trouble,
[01:20:59] we don't wanna do anything wrong,
[01:21:00] we don't wanna look bad, and that's what happens.
[01:21:02] You see them stack up on a building,
[01:21:04] I don't wanna go, do you wanna go, I don't wanna go.
[01:21:06] So you have to inculcate them with the right culture
[01:21:10] where they know, hey, if you make a mistake,
[01:21:12] it's okay, because you're getting after it.
[01:21:14] I mean, we just did a freaking podcast
[01:21:15] about the damn Nazis.
[01:21:18] And part of the Nazis culture that they tried to instill
[01:21:21] was we'd rather have you make a bad decision
[01:21:23] and do something than not make a decision at all.
[01:21:26] Yeah, the worst decision is no decision sometimes.
[01:21:29] So the training that I'm talking about,
[01:21:31] it involves everything and it corrects all these problems.
[01:21:35] It's getting in shape, getting more,
[01:21:36] you're attuned to stress, human confrontation,
[01:21:40] de-escalation, how to defend yourself,
[01:21:43] how to not damage or how to lessen damage to a suspect.
[01:21:47] I think it's awesome, overall.
[01:21:49] You had that department that,
[01:21:51] I'm not saying this should be the policy,
[01:21:53] but one was at Michigan, some county, the sheriff,
[01:21:56] everyone had to be a blue belt in his department.
[01:21:58] Now I'm not saying that should be, then again,
[01:22:00] but it sounds like we're on the right track there.
[01:22:04] I'm just saying, I think it's, but then again,
[01:22:06] we're partial because we have this great reality college,
[01:22:09] where we're exposed to the other person.
[01:22:11] But also, we're seeing the news and we're seeing cops
[01:22:16] have to do things and get beat up by one guy
[01:22:19] and taking two or three people to take somebody
[01:22:20] and getting weapons taken away and it's like awful to see.
[01:22:23] How does this even happening?
[01:22:24] So it's not, look, we might be biased towards Jiu-Jitsu,
[01:22:27] fine, take my bias out of it, I'll still tell you
[01:22:30] that you better learn how to fight and you better train
[01:22:33] and you better spend time training.
[01:22:35] Jaco, you've seen at least 10 different videos,
[01:22:37] 10 different, I'm talking Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt
[01:22:40] versus random Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:22:42] Yeah, yeah, yeah, like for instance,
[01:22:44] he's mounted on the I-Com, Matt Serra,
[01:22:46] in Vegas this drunk guy was harassing him and haul.
[01:22:50] Rhyan haul, also in some restaurant.
[01:22:52] Rhyan haul?
[01:22:53] No, Rhyan haul.
[01:22:54] Rhyan haul, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:55] I'm full of drunk people and they're just mounted like,
[01:22:56] hey man, calm down, I'll sue you and this whole guy,
[01:22:58] you know, hey, call with the cop, you know,
[01:23:00] and the security comes and nobody gets punched.
[01:23:02] And I know this is the cops and the guy doesn't have a gun,
[01:23:04] I understand, but I'm saying these are black belts,
[01:23:06] which is of course different level,
[01:23:07] but they're holding it out and not hurting them.
[01:23:09] And they don't have three homies with batons.
[01:23:12] So by the way, you wanna have groups,
[01:23:13] you wanna have team tactics with law enforcement,
[01:23:17] of course, I'm not saying,
[01:23:18] but it is cool if you have the ability
[01:23:20] and the opportunity to, well, look at that.
[01:23:23] And it's also one from Brazil, this guy tried to,
[01:23:25] I'm not saying, I think she's just left,
[01:23:27] but this guy tried to, I don't know,
[01:23:31] take her purse or something and she's like,
[01:23:32] mounted on the guy, just beat him up.
[01:23:33] This is in Brazil, legit black belt,
[01:23:35] just female, just, the guy screaming,
[01:23:37] he's going soco, soco, which means help in Portuguese.
[01:23:39] Soco, soco, it means help in Portuguese
[01:23:42] and no one's helping him, it's just a film.
[01:23:44] It's like, just mounted, just beat the guy,
[01:23:46] like it's kinda brutal, but that is just,
[01:23:49] let's say it's a grandiose comparison,
[01:23:51] but if you have that opportunity and that ability,
[01:23:55] it's pretty cool, there we go.
[01:23:57] And it's heinous to watch this stuff
[01:24:02] on an almost daily basis, or, I mean, at least once a week,
[01:24:06] you're seeing a video of a cop that's not trained
[01:24:10] and at a bad outcome.
[01:24:13] And look, there's all kinds of cops
[01:24:15] that are doing the right thing all the time,
[01:24:16] there's cops that train Jiu Jitsu,
[01:24:17] there's cops that are doing things right
[01:24:19] to the best of their ability.
[01:24:20] By the way, they're investing their own money
[01:24:22] and their own time so that they can be better police officers.
[01:24:27] Good on them, but should you have to make that sacrifice?
[01:24:29] And by the way, what if you know,
[01:24:30] a guy's got a wife and kids and he's got a mortgage to pay
[01:24:32] and all of a sudden, it's $148 a month to train Jiu Jitsu
[01:24:36] or it's $165 a month to train Jiu Jitsu,
[01:24:39] all of a sudden it's like,
[01:24:41] I gotta make a choice between getting my kid a new bicycle
[01:24:45] and training Jiu Jitsu, you know what,
[01:24:47] I'm gonna sacrifice this month and the next thing,
[01:24:49] they look up in three years and they're not trained anymore.
[01:24:52] So why not help the police so that they can help the community?
[01:24:57] You know, they're doing a good job is our bro Ryan with BP.
[01:25:00] Yeah.
[01:25:01] Yes, that was React now, it's called the Bortak.
[01:25:04] They're like the federal SWAT team with the border.
[01:25:06] They actually had the guys who killed the Uvaldi shooter.
[01:25:08] Yeah, 100%.
[01:25:09] But these guys actually, Ryan has these guys,
[01:25:11] I mean, they do medical training, I don't know,
[01:25:12] but every day, but they have the Umbaricades training,
[01:25:16] you know, or they're doing ground,
[01:25:18] I even did a few similar classes out there
[01:25:20] and they don't wanna learn like the new knee lock, you know,
[01:25:22] and they're doing like the combattas,
[01:25:23] but for the Bortak, it's pretty cool
[01:25:26] because they're not just sitting around
[01:25:28] while they're going on duty,
[01:25:29] but they actually training every day.
[01:25:30] That's pretty cool.
[01:25:31] And that's the way law enforcement should be.
[01:25:35] You should train 20% of your time.
[01:25:38] If that means you train, you know, an hour a day
[01:25:40] or an hour and a half or two hours every day,
[01:25:42] or that means you take one day a week
[01:25:43] where you train all day, I don't know, but figure it out,
[01:25:47] because if you're not training,
[01:25:47] you're not gonna be prepared.
[01:25:49] And when you're not prepared, then you overreact.
[01:25:50] When you overreact, that causes problems.
[01:25:53] And then you get, you know, innocent people getting killed,
[01:25:57] or people that don't deserve to get killed, get killed.
[01:25:59] Why?
[01:26:00] Because there's a panic happening.
[01:26:01] It's extreme jockel, but I had a acquaintance
[01:26:04] that we're talking, he was talking about,
[01:26:05] he was an Afghanistan, he was in the Marines,
[01:26:08] and he was like, no, an army, my bad, it was army.
[01:26:10] Both sides will kill me for saying that.
[01:26:12] And he was talking about how they would practice
[01:26:14] putting IVs in with night vision on.
[01:26:16] Yeah.
[01:26:17] And like, you know, well, why?
[01:26:19] Well, in case we have night vision on, we can't see, you know?
[01:26:21] And, you know, cause it's different,
[01:26:23] that perception or whatever, but he's like, yeah,
[01:26:24] you know, that's just something like, okay, that makes sense.
[01:26:27] But that sounds kind of extreme.
[01:26:28] Well, why is it extreme?
[01:26:30] One day you might have to do that.
[01:26:31] Yeah, and how much better are you prepared for
[01:26:33] if you don't have to have night vision on?
[01:26:35] Well, cool.
[01:26:36] Yeah, it's easier.
[01:26:37] If you happen to roll up on a suspect
[01:26:39] and they attack you and they weigh 110 pounds,
[01:26:42] and they don't know anything, cool, you can handle them.
[01:26:44] Great.
[01:26:45] But what happens when they're 220 pounds
[01:26:46] and they're a purple belt?
[01:26:48] Yeah.
[01:26:48] Or they wrestled in high school.
[01:26:50] Is it most training for in case something goes wrong?
[01:26:52] Should be.
[01:26:53] So you have a jam in your pistol.
[01:26:54] Oh, well, I mean, you didn't clean your pistol correctly.
[01:26:56] Well, it's still gonna happen.
[01:26:57] It's still gonna have jams.
[01:26:58] There's level one, two, I don't know, three, what level?
[01:27:00] That's what Sarge taught me.
[01:27:01] Different ways to clear a jam.
[01:27:02] But in case something goes wrong,
[01:27:04] if nothing goes wrong, you actually don't need to drill.
[01:27:06] Really think, why do I need to drill
[01:27:08] if nothing ever goes wrong?
[01:27:09] Something's gonna go wrong eventually.
[01:27:10] So that's, I'm just saying,
[01:27:11] you did to martial arts, what they're doing in the army,
[01:27:13] I think is really good because we're getting ready for,
[01:27:16] in case something bad happens.
[01:27:17] Yeah.
[01:27:18] So all of this will straighten out your mindset.
[01:27:22] Yeah.
[01:27:23] It will straighten out your mindset.
[01:27:25] Cause if you're not used to this stuff,
[01:27:29] when somebody grabs you and you're not used to it,
[01:27:30] like somebody grabs me or you or you,
[01:27:32] like somebody grabs one of us,
[01:27:34] there's no mental hurdle of any kind
[01:27:38] to be prepared for combat in that moment.
[01:27:40] Most people, when they get grabbed,
[01:27:43] they haven't ever been grabbed before.
[01:27:45] And they have to, they have a giant mental hurdle clear
[01:27:48] before they can even respond in any way.
[01:27:51] Nevermind appropriately.
[01:27:52] And by the way, they're not gonna respond appropriately.
[01:27:53] They're gonna respond badly.
[01:27:55] So it's like, this has to change.
[01:28:01] And like you said, I mean, I think this,
[01:28:03] a lot of the stuff that's in this army combat is manual
[01:28:05] is suitable for law enforcement.
[01:28:09] And there's some people that freak out, by the way,
[01:28:11] when you say that,
[01:28:12] oh, you want the cops to be military, paramilitary?
[01:28:17] Yes, actually.
[01:28:18] I want them to be well trained.
[01:28:19] I want them to be ready for whatever's going to happen.
[01:28:23] Yeah.
[01:28:24] So there you go.
[01:28:29] Then they go through like how to sustain,
[01:28:31] how to get people sustained,
[01:28:33] where they can then keep up their training and stay good.
[01:28:38] Here's an everyday mission essential task list
[01:28:41] requiring use of combative skills.
[01:28:43] A compliant subject at a traffic control point
[01:28:46] suddenly becomes non-compliant.
[01:28:48] These are just like things to run, just scenarios to run.
[01:28:51] The battalion indicates that an intelligent subject
[01:28:53] must be captured during the search and seizure mission.
[01:28:56] The lead man in the search team encounters
[01:28:58] hostile opposition and has a weapons malfunction.
[01:29:01] Okay.
[01:29:02] Could that happen?
[01:29:03] Yes, absolutely.
[01:29:04] Three, when turning on the enemy,
[01:29:06] grab the soldier's weapon and pins him against the wall.
[01:29:09] Okay, could that happen?
[01:29:10] Yes, it could.
[01:29:11] In close quarters, an enemy attacks a soldier
[01:29:14] under zero illumination.
[01:29:15] Could that happen?
[01:29:16] Yes, it could.
[01:29:18] These are everyday situations that could happen.
[01:29:21] Well, yeah, they could happen in combat,
[01:29:22] but they could happen in law enforcement as well.
[01:29:25] And if you're not ready for them in any way,
[01:29:27] you're not going to know what to do
[01:29:29] and you're going to fall apart.
[01:29:31] And then you're going to have to go through
[01:29:33] what you're about to do and you're going to fall apart.
[01:29:36] And then you're going to end up doing something stupid.
[01:29:38] You know, I've heard, actually,
[01:29:42] we talked about this when I was in Puerto Rico
[01:29:43] working with a couple of military guys,
[01:29:45] that a lot of guys are used to these optics,
[01:29:48] like these, you know, BealTech,
[01:29:50] whatever these things on their carbines or their pistols.
[01:29:53] If that doesn't work one day or it goes out,
[01:29:55] they're not practiced with open sights.
[01:29:57] So the thing is like, I mean, if you rely upon
[01:30:00] that right there, specifically that,
[01:30:01] you don't have that available to you, like, you know,
[01:30:03] you're not keeping yourself up to date
[01:30:07] upon if something goes wrong, the drilling,
[01:30:09] I think it's really good.
[01:30:09] So if you're exactly caught and you can't see,
[01:30:13] if I can have someone, if I have a hold of someone,
[01:30:15] I don't need my eyes that much, to be honest.
[01:30:17] You don't really need your eyes.
[01:30:18] You can't even tell me.
[01:30:18] Five-year leg, I know what that is.
[01:30:20] Yeah, people compete when they're blind.
[01:30:21] Yeah, absolutely.
[01:30:22] There's some strong guys.
[01:30:23] Strong, blind guys.
[01:30:24] Ryan Job, I was trained with Ryan Job after he was blind.
[01:30:27] And it was like, you know,
[01:30:28] once you make contact with him, it's like, it's on.
[01:30:31] Yeah.
[01:30:34] Talks about, you know, a bunch of stuff
[01:30:36] with live training, ground sparring, situational sparring.
[01:30:40] Right, that's something that we've been doing
[01:30:41] for a long time.
[01:30:43] Soldier A begins in Soldier B's guard.
[01:30:46] They spar until Soldier A passes the guard,
[01:30:47] his swept or submitted.
[01:30:49] Reset, reset points, yeah.
[01:30:51] That's it.
[01:30:53] It's very straightforward things,
[01:30:54] but you could do that with every aspect,
[01:30:58] like any of these scenarios.
[01:31:00] You can run these scenarios, okay, it's dark,
[01:31:02] you grab my weapon, let's do it once,
[01:31:03] let's do it twice, let's do it three times,
[01:31:04] let's do it five times, what works, what doesn't work?
[01:31:08] These are like pieces of the puzzle
[01:31:09] that separate each piece as different,
[01:31:12] but in the end, you put it all together.
[01:31:13] So it's hard to do the puzzle unless you see,
[01:31:15] you know, what the picture is, you know,
[01:31:17] what you're gonna make.
[01:31:18] And if you don't understand the pieces,
[01:31:20] they make the frame with the corners first,
[01:31:21] and of course, and so I think it's a good way
[01:31:24] to have these situational, or I call it reset drills,
[01:31:26] or timing grade drills.
[01:31:28] It's really good to have.
[01:31:30] Yeah, and they go through, you know,
[01:31:32] everything from like, oh, how you spar on the ground,
[01:31:35] how you spar with takedowns, how you do,
[01:31:39] I guess we call it shootboxing,
[01:31:40] where you're like boxing gloves,
[01:31:42] but you're doing takedowns.
[01:31:44] What do they call that?
[01:31:45] They call it kickboxing with takedowns.
[01:31:47] Okay, cool.
[01:31:49] And then you still have to sometimes,
[01:31:51] as you said earlier, if we only do shootboxing,
[01:31:56] and we never do wrestling by itself,
[01:31:59] or we never advance to where we're doing a full sparring,
[01:32:06] then we're gonna miss something.
[01:32:08] So you have to mix it up to some extent,
[01:32:12] or it can be a problem.
[01:32:20] This is where it starts talking about
[01:32:21] basic ground fighting techniques.
[01:32:24] Basic ground fighting techniques build a funda...
[01:32:27] So all that, like we, now we're getting in,
[01:32:30] this is just talking about like how to run a program,
[01:32:32] how to set up a program, what the safety protocols are,
[01:32:34] and then it gets into the like the actual fighting.
[01:32:37] Basic ground fighting techniques
[01:32:38] build a fundamental understanding of dominant body positions,
[01:32:41] and should be one of the primary focuses
[01:32:43] before moving on to more advanced techniques.
[01:32:45] Basic fight strategy.
[01:32:46] When two untrained fighters meet,
[01:32:48] they instinctively fight using the universal fight plan.
[01:32:51] They pummel each other with their fists
[01:32:53] until one of them receives enough damage
[01:32:55] that they cannot fight back effectively.
[01:32:57] Most forms of martial arts training
[01:32:59] are designed to make fighters better
[01:33:00] at executing this strategy.
[01:33:02] However, this approach has two drawbacks.
[01:33:06] One, or both fighters are unarmed.
[01:33:09] Progress is solely dependent on the development of skill.
[01:33:14] Bigger, this is actually three drawbacks,
[01:33:16] bigger, stronger, and faster fighters
[01:33:18] have a natural advantage.
[01:33:20] Developing enough skill to overcome these advantages
[01:33:22] requires more time that can be dedicated
[01:33:24] during institutional training.
[01:33:25] Well, that's a little bit of a weird thing to say
[01:33:27] because we already talked about it,
[01:33:28] and they already talked about the fact
[01:33:29] that it's gonna take time.
[01:33:31] So you can't use that excuse here a little bit.
[01:33:35] The combatives program uses a more efficient approach.
[01:33:38] Fighting is taught in the context of strategy.
[01:33:39] The basic fight, basic techniques serve as an educating
[01:33:44] metaphor to teach the basic fight strategy.
[01:33:48] Fighters learn to defeat an opponent
[01:33:50] by controlling the elements of the fight.
[01:33:52] Range, angle, and level.
[01:33:55] The number one element of a fight is range.
[01:33:58] The combatives program has four phases,
[01:34:00] projectile, striking, clinching, grappling.
[01:34:06] This chapter involves the soldiers,
[01:34:08] provides soldiers with these basic techniques
[01:34:11] at basic levels against an unarmed enemy.
[01:34:14] According to circumstances of surrounded conflict,
[01:34:16] fighters can use these techniques
[01:34:17] to disable opponent or force the opponent to submit.
[01:34:21] You know what I'm talking about?
[01:34:22] These four different levels.
[01:34:23] I like that they're in the projectiles.
[01:34:25] That's actually something that's good.
[01:34:26] Boss room, when you say it,
[01:34:28] like you can throw a chair at someone.
[01:34:29] Yeah, for sure.
[01:34:30] And the perfect hand stuff.
[01:34:31] For sure.
[01:34:32] So one thing I noticed,
[01:34:34] muay thai, muay thai,
[01:34:35] which of course is a great, great style.
[01:34:37] Kickboxing, the kick with the shins,
[01:34:38] which that's how I kick.
[01:34:40] But if you have a boot on,
[01:34:42] if you block shin and shin with a shin,
[01:34:44] you have a strong shin, fine.
[01:34:45] But a boot hitting your shin,
[01:34:47] it's an issue, bro.
[01:34:48] It's an issue.
[01:34:49] So savant from France.
[01:34:50] They have these little, like wrestling,
[01:34:51] with little metal tips though.
[01:34:53] It's like, they're not pointy,
[01:34:54] but if you block muay thai,
[01:34:56] and they have those little shoes on with the metal tip,
[01:34:58] your shin is, it's a problem.
[01:34:59] So interesting, based on how you're dressed, a boot,
[01:35:03] if you block your shin,
[01:35:04] a boot kicking your shin is gonna be,
[01:35:05] let's say not a winning situation for you.
[01:35:08] So I'm just saying that since you get,
[01:35:09] we're looking at now because I'm sure they're not,
[01:35:12] they're thinking about having the uniform on,
[01:35:13] maybe body armor, the boots,
[01:35:16] maybe not a boot, maybe shoes,
[01:35:17] but different, it depends on how you're dressed.
[01:35:19] That's another thing too.
[01:35:20] However, I am on the side of muay thai.
[01:35:23] I'm on the side of, you know,
[01:35:24] there's even this style in Burma where they use head butts.
[01:35:26] It's crazy.
[01:35:27] It's pretty effective, by the way.
[01:35:28] You know, you don't have to throw a head butt.
[01:35:30] This kind of stuff.
[01:35:31] So I do think it's good to get the training with muay thai.
[01:35:33] When you got a helmet on.
[01:35:35] That's true.
[01:35:36] Cause then you can head butt somebody
[01:35:37] and it's like, no damage to you at all.
[01:35:39] And they won't like the result.
[01:35:40] It's a good times.
[01:35:41] Every sip yet.
[01:35:42] You know, so the way, you know,
[01:35:44] but if we spar with boots and you kick in the knees with boot,
[01:35:47] you know, it's gonna hurt,
[01:35:47] you're gonna get hurt real fast.
[01:35:48] Probably can't, it's gonna be more dangerous.
[01:35:50] We spar muay thai.
[01:35:51] You can learn how, in case someone had to do it
[01:35:53] on how to defend it.
[01:35:54] You get the training from muay thai with the tactics
[01:35:56] and let's say the open minded way,
[01:35:59] that maybe the arms showing here,
[01:36:01] and you could adapt tactics for something like that.
[01:36:03] I think it's good.
[01:36:04] I think it's good to add to projectiles.
[01:36:05] It's actually a good detail.
[01:36:06] Well, yeah.
[01:36:07] And by projectiles, they also be guns.
[01:36:09] Oh, okay.
[01:36:10] Yeah.
[01:36:11] That counts the projectile.
[01:36:11] You mean throwing the rifle with someone?
[01:36:13] Yeah.
[01:36:14] Um, here's some, here's some like the basic concepts.
[01:36:20] Create space.
[01:36:22] When in combat, a soldier's primary goal to be established,
[01:36:25] should be to establish space between him and his attacker.
[01:36:29] A soldier must create enough space
[01:36:30] to transition to his primary weapon.
[01:36:32] So there you go.
[01:36:34] Maintain space.
[01:36:35] When in combat, soldiers may be unable to create enough space
[01:36:39] and transition to their primary weapon.
[01:36:40] If unable to do so,
[01:36:41] they may need to maintain space to transition
[01:36:43] to their secondary weapon,
[01:36:46] or close the distance gained down at body position
[01:36:47] and finish the fight.
[01:36:49] So you want to create space,
[01:36:50] you want to maintain space,
[01:36:51] you might have to close the distance.
[01:36:52] When training soldiers,
[01:36:53] the primary goal should be instilling the courage
[01:36:56] to close the distance.
[01:36:58] The willingness to close with the enemy
[01:36:59] is a defining characteristic of a warrior,
[01:37:01] and the ability to do so against an aggressive opponent
[01:37:03] is the first step in using range to control a fight.
[01:37:07] This is something that I've talked about so much
[01:37:09] because you get that question all the time.
[01:37:10] Well, is Jiu Jitsu really the best thing for self-defense?
[01:37:12] And you've heard me give this explanation a thousand times.
[01:37:16] If I have space, I don't need any self-defense at all.
[01:37:18] I can get away from you and run away, and that's fine.
[01:37:20] It's when you grab me, that's when we have a problem.
[01:37:22] That's when I better know Jiu Jitsu.
[01:37:23] That's when I better know how to grapple at least.
[01:37:26] Gain, so they say close the distance.
[01:37:28] If you have to, if you can't create space,
[01:37:31] or you can't maintain space,
[01:37:32] the next thing is you actually go on the attack
[01:37:35] and you close the distance, you get in close,
[01:37:37] gain dominant position, and then finish the fight.
[01:37:40] That's the protocol that they give.
[01:37:44] And then it gets into ground grappling.
[01:37:47] Ground grappling provides a sound base.
[01:37:49] And by the way, I'm not reading the whole book, obviously,
[01:37:52] but it's skipping ahead to the ground grappling,
[01:37:56] basic techniques, standing base with a primary weapon,
[01:37:59] fighting stance, opposing grip, thumbs grip,
[01:38:02] wrestlers grip, thumb and thumbless grip,
[01:38:06] dominant body positions, rear mount,
[01:38:07] guard, side control.
[01:38:10] And then it starts giving basic positions, basic moves.
[01:38:13] And it goes through basic finishing moves,
[01:38:15] rear naked choke, cross collar choke from the mount and guard,
[01:38:18] bent arm bar from the mount and side control,
[01:38:20] straight arm bar from the mount,
[01:38:21] straight arm bar from the guard, guillotine choke.
[01:38:24] Blood chokes attack the blood supply to the brain,
[01:38:27] air choke support attack the air supply.
[01:38:29] These chokes will take longer to cause unconsciousness,
[01:38:32] gives joint locks, tapping procedures.
[01:38:38] That's always good.
[01:38:39] I think that's, I failed on that one.
[01:38:41] When I hurt John Dudley, my buddy John Dudley,
[01:38:45] he pushed me.
[01:38:46] No, I didn't give him like a pre-brief.
[01:38:48] Oh, okay.
[01:38:49] You know, like, hey dude, I just assumed
[01:38:52] that he would just tap.
[01:38:54] And it may or may not have helped
[01:38:55] because he was also kind of fired up, you know?
[01:38:57] John Dudley going, going, going to the Zercher mode,
[01:38:59] level nine.
[01:39:00] Oh yeah.
[01:39:02] And he's a great athlete in like 29 different categories.
[01:39:06] So when he was going ham, you know,
[01:39:09] but I didn't give him a good, a good brief.
[01:39:13] So make sure if you're teaching someone,
[01:39:14] you tell them how to tap.
[01:39:18] Then it talks about sweeps and takedowns.
[01:39:20] And, you know, one thing that's interesting
[01:39:23] is it starts giving like how to stand up in base,
[01:39:25] which we all know, but how do you stand up in base?
[01:39:27] Well, the weapon.
[01:39:28] Like that's also something to think about.
[01:39:30] So they address a lot of these things
[01:39:33] that take a little bit of thought
[01:39:36] about how you're going to do it.
[01:39:37] Cause you don't want to put down your weapon
[01:39:39] so you can stand up.
[01:39:40] No, you want to be able to,
[01:39:42] you want to be able to stand up
[01:39:43] while you're still holding your weapon.
[01:39:46] Fast forward a little bit again, you know,
[01:39:48] they talk about the fighting stance.
[01:39:49] And the fighting stance allows the soldier
[01:39:51] to assume an offensive posture conducive to attack
[01:39:54] while still being able to move and defend himself.
[01:39:56] The fighting stance is not only perform
[01:39:58] a platform for unarmed fighting,
[01:40:00] it can also be used for various weapons
[01:40:02] from close range contact weapons to projectile weapons.
[01:40:05] Just detail, man.
[01:40:06] The fighter keeps their chin tucked.
[01:40:08] The fighter looks just beneath their eyebrows
[01:40:10] at the opponent.
[01:40:11] The fighter uses a lead soldier
[01:40:11] to block the side of the face.
[01:40:13] Just squared away, you know, procedures.
[01:40:16] And even the whole book,
[01:40:19] the manual's got every conceivable thing.
[01:40:23] I mean, fast forward here, the mount.
[01:40:25] The mount allows a fighter to strike the opponent
[01:40:27] with punches while restricting the opponent's ability
[01:40:29] to deliver effective return punches.
[01:40:32] The mount provides the leverage to attack
[01:40:33] the opponent's upper body with strokes and joint attack.
[01:40:35] It goes through in detail all these different positions
[01:40:41] and then, you know, the guard.
[01:40:45] And all this stuff is the same stuff we say.
[01:40:47] A fighter never wants to be under their opponent.
[01:40:50] The guard enables them to defend themselves
[01:40:52] and transition off their back
[01:40:53] into a more advantageous position.
[01:40:55] But yeah, that's how it was.
[01:40:56] What are you gonna do with a street fight?
[01:40:57] Pull guard?
[01:40:58] No one says that.
[01:40:59] Not one person has ever said that in a serious way.
[01:41:02] They might have joked about it,
[01:41:03] but no one says pull guard in a fight.
[01:41:06] Guard means you made a mistake.
[01:41:09] You messed up.
[01:41:10] That's why you're in guard.
[01:41:13] A fighter never wants to be under their opponent.
[01:41:16] Right, exactly.
[01:41:17] We all agree with that.
[01:41:20] The guard allows the bottom fighter to exercise
[01:41:22] a certain amount of control over the range
[01:41:24] by pushing out or pulling in his opponent
[01:41:26] with his hips and legs.
[01:41:27] Yes.
[01:41:28] So,
[01:41:30] there you go.
[01:41:31] I mean, and it's got tons of detail in this manual.
[01:41:36] And by the way, obviously this manual is unclassified.
[01:41:38] You can find it on the internet.
[01:41:40] But it's there.
[01:41:41] And if you wanna look through it, go look through it.
[01:41:43] Learn, learn some stuff.
[01:41:44] Learn about intermediate ground fighting techniques.
[01:41:49] So then it starts talking about the intermittent fight.
[01:41:52] Their intermediate fight strategy involves adjusting
[01:41:54] the basic fight strategy taught in chapter three,
[01:41:56] to accommodate the unpredictable
[01:41:57] and very, very nature of operations.
[01:42:01] Though learning basic combative techniques
[01:42:03] taught in chapter three,
[01:42:05] soldiers are instilled with basic fight strategy.
[01:42:07] The easiest way to impact a soldier's fighting ability.
[01:42:10] However, soldiers often find themselves
[01:42:11] in unpredictable situations that span
[01:42:13] the spectrum of operations.
[01:42:14] Therefore, soldiers must be prepared
[01:42:15] to adjust their fight strategy to fit the situation
[01:42:18] rather than making every situation fit the preferred strategy.
[01:42:21] So this is telling you to learn more and be adaptable
[01:42:25] and try different scenarios.
[01:42:29] And now you start talking about intermediate mount
[01:42:32] and side control techniques.
[01:42:36] Posting on the arms, posting on the side,
[01:42:39] larger opponent pins.
[01:42:41] This is just getting into more advanced stuff.
[01:42:44] How to pass the guard, attacks from the mount,
[01:42:46] attacks from the rear.
[01:42:47] It's just, it just continues to grow your skill level
[01:42:52] and eventually gets to grappling with strikes.
[01:42:57] Right, so now, it says here,
[01:43:01] leaders should not make the mistake
[01:43:02] of practicing ground fighting techniques exclusively.
[01:43:06] Striking is an integral part of all types of fighting.
[01:43:08] Grappling with open and closed fist strikes,
[01:43:11] force the fighters to ensure
[01:43:12] that they have positive control over their opponent's hands
[01:43:14] which in turn can prevent the fighter's opponent
[01:43:17] from striking them in the face or using weapons.
[01:43:19] This is what's cool about Eddie Bravo's combat jujitsu.
[01:43:22] Right?
[01:43:23] Because there's some positions in jujitsu,
[01:43:26] they work in jujitsu, but if you did them in a fight,
[01:43:29] they're not gonna work so good
[01:43:30] when you're getting punched in the head.
[01:43:31] Especially the palm, not just a slap, palm strikes,
[01:43:34] like a punch.
[01:43:35] They're actually not as bone breaking
[01:43:36] as a punch with knuckles, but they sting more.
[01:43:40] The slaps hurt more than a punch.
[01:43:42] Oh, the slaps definitely hurt more than a punch.
[01:43:43] They don't damage your face as much.
[01:43:46] Like, like cut you, you know,
[01:43:48] break your cheekbone, things like that.
[01:43:50] Well, it's a different kind of pain,
[01:43:51] but I mean, getting punched is fine.
[01:43:53] The palm strike can, but that's,
[01:43:54] ooh, slap man, that's a slap.
[01:43:56] Slap down your chest, your back.
[01:43:58] Oh yeah, the slaps to the ribs,
[01:44:01] the slaps to the ribs is like a torture.
[01:44:03] Jocko myself, he does this many times.
[01:44:04] Like, remember, like, if we're having like one of those days,
[01:44:08] you start pulling the shirt up and bro,
[01:44:10] then we got back and forth, like, we're still bros,
[01:44:12] but we're still like, okay, slap, slap.
[01:44:14] There's like, I think at some point,
[01:44:16] let's just calm down now.
[01:44:18] That's not funny.
[01:44:19] There's an escalation that could occur at some times.
[01:44:21] And unfortunately for me,
[01:44:22] I'm usually getting the raw end of that escalation.
[01:44:24] That depends on the date.
[01:44:25] I have to hope for a piece out there.
[01:44:28] I remember one time when my kid,
[01:44:29] my son was probably like 12 maybe,
[01:44:35] and we were training and I had a bad ankle injury.
[01:44:39] Speaking of Sarge, Sarge shot a single on me
[01:44:44] and like I did something or whatever and it really hurt.
[01:44:51] I was one of the worst injuries I've had.
[01:44:53] And luckily it was Sarge and he like,
[01:44:55] as it was probably gonna break,
[01:44:57] he like released and like, whatever, moved his weight.
[01:45:01] But my ankle's really sprained.
[01:45:04] And so I'm rolling a couple of days later, of course,
[01:45:08] because that's what we're doing.
[01:45:08] I had like one of that, you know,
[01:45:10] the ankle braces that like lace up.
[01:45:13] They're super tight and they have like a,
[01:45:16] so I had one of those things on.
[01:45:17] So I'm rolling with my son and he's like 12.
[01:45:21] And you know, I like get side control
[01:45:24] or something like half guard, I'm in half guard.
[01:45:26] And I like pull his shirt up a little bit
[01:45:28] and I slap him right on the ribs, that painful spot.
[01:45:32] Yeah.
[01:45:33] And you can see he's trying to move.
[01:45:35] And he can't really, you can see it's like mad, right?
[01:45:38] And then you know, whatever,
[01:45:39] a transition to another position,
[01:45:40] he let him get up on top or whatever.
[01:45:43] He dives on a toehold.
[01:45:47] He dives on a toehold on my injured foot.
[01:45:51] And you know, quite frankly, I probably should have tapped.
[01:45:56] I probably should have tapped,
[01:45:58] but obviously there was no way I was tapping to my own son.
[01:46:02] So I like escape that.
[01:46:05] And this is the, I've told you this story before.
[01:46:07] So then I got across side and I was like,
[01:46:12] and I started, I did the paper cutter choke.
[01:46:16] Wiki?
[01:46:17] Yeah.
[01:46:18] And I go, I said something like,
[01:46:20] hey, I'm injured, you idiot.
[01:46:24] Do you want, don't, don't attack someone
[01:46:27] that's injured in their injured area and try to hurt them.
[01:46:31] Do you understand?
[01:46:32] Sorry, yes sir.
[01:46:33] No, he didn't answer it.
[01:46:35] He's just looking at me and I'm looking at him
[01:46:39] and I go, do you understand?
[01:46:40] And he's still pissed that I slapped him, right?
[01:46:43] So I started applying the choke
[01:46:47] and I'm applying it hard.
[01:46:48] And I'm like, do you understand?
[01:46:49] He's still just looking at me.
[01:46:50] I'm like, okay, I'm gonna kill him.
[01:46:53] But I'm like, okay, test of wills.
[01:46:54] He's gonna have to die.
[01:46:56] That's it.
[01:46:57] So I start, you know how you know
[01:46:58] that paper cutter choke, you go down,
[01:46:59] then you start going out.
[01:47:00] I was down and now I'm going out.
[01:47:03] And he's starting to turn red and purple
[01:47:05] and find he's like, I understand.
[01:47:06] I was like, what?
[01:47:07] He's like, I understand.
[01:47:08] And I was like, okay.
[01:47:09] And then we just kept trading, you know?
[01:47:11] But yeah, do.
[01:47:12] You had that coming to you by the way.
[01:47:14] Oh, I definitely had it coming to me.
[01:47:17] Although, yeah, I had it coming to me.
[01:47:20] There's a debate of principle for sure,
[01:47:22] but you had it coming to you.
[01:47:25] Wait, what?
[01:47:27] Why?
[01:47:28] The slap thing on the phone.
[01:47:29] The slap thing, even though the slap thing
[01:47:31] is still done in fun, right?
[01:47:34] There's still a level of fun to it.
[01:47:36] There's no fun about trying to hurt someone that's injured.
[01:47:39] Yeah.
[01:47:41] Yeah, but the argument could be made.
[01:47:43] Hey, look, I'm not your son.
[01:47:45] I'm not you, so I don't know.
[01:47:46] But maybe some of us didn't sign up for that fun that day.
[01:47:50] You see what I'm saying?
[01:47:52] That's good that it's fun for you.
[01:47:53] It really is.
[01:47:54] Congratulations.
[01:47:55] You know what though?
[01:47:56] You gotta learn to control those emotions a little bit.
[01:47:58] It's part of the process.
[01:47:59] It's part of the process.
[01:48:00] Remember when you were back at City Boxing,
[01:48:04] came back from wherever.
[01:48:04] You had like Tom, you had Grady Mack,
[01:48:06] you had, you know, you had all these guys in the man,
[01:48:08] like 10 seals, you had one Marine,
[01:48:10] who was the force we got?
[01:48:11] The H.
[01:48:12] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:48:13] And you got training, I was slapping them.
[01:48:15] Like because they were down with it,
[01:48:17] because they were getting ready for like deployment.
[01:48:18] There was like, and I was talking smack to them.
[01:48:21] I'm like, request permission to go back to base.
[01:48:25] Mission not accomplished.
[01:48:27] Like, no, say it.
[01:48:29] Mission scrubbed, request permission.
[01:48:31] Anyways, that was a game.
[01:48:32] But then again, there was just some fired up guys
[01:48:34] and it was like the game.
[01:48:35] So the average person, I wouldn't, you know,
[01:48:37] just to crack across the body.
[01:48:38] But the sun, yeah, injured foot, understood.
[01:48:42] What's your assessment?
[01:48:43] Echo says I'm wrong.
[01:48:46] It's kind of mutual, like you and I,
[01:48:48] we do it because we think it's funny,
[01:48:49] it's statistically funny.
[01:48:50] By the way, Jocko has his days,
[01:48:52] he makes me feel kind of ashamed sometimes.
[01:48:54] I understand.
[01:48:56] But I mean, it's a mutual thing.
[01:48:57] It's just different.
[01:48:58] I don't know why.
[01:48:59] I don't know for such a long time.
[01:49:00] We've always trained that way.
[01:49:01] We've always trained that way, for sure.
[01:49:02] Wrist, whatever.
[01:49:03] You know what, okay, so this is, I think this is true.
[01:49:06] You know, rattlesnakes, right?
[01:49:07] When they're like not full grown,
[01:49:10] when they bite, they say they're more kind of dangerous,
[01:49:12] right, because they can't control their venom.
[01:49:14] So consider your 12 year old kid, right?
[01:49:16] You're like, okay, we're going,
[01:49:18] we're going street level or whatever, right?
[01:49:19] Because there's such thing as street rules.
[01:49:22] So okay, we're going street rules.
[01:49:23] And that's what I would say the slap is.
[01:49:25] I mean, it's usually mutual and kind of understood
[01:49:29] in this way.
[01:49:29] But someone might misunderstood it
[01:49:30] and they just go hand-back like really hard.
[01:49:32] Exactly, you don't just do it to anybody.
[01:49:35] So, yeah, I'm not rolling like a random person in.
[01:49:37] Yeah, certainly.
[01:49:38] You think he is.
[01:49:39] Has to be your friend or your enemy.
[01:49:40] Friend or enemy.
[01:49:41] And why don't we do it to anybody?
[01:49:43] No, actually, you wouldn't even really slap,
[01:49:45] rib slap your enemy.
[01:49:48] That's sort of like don't move, right?
[01:49:50] This is just like, you know, general friendly harassment.
[01:49:53] Right, yeah, friendly harassment, exactly, right.
[01:49:56] So, but the reason you don't do it to like a stranger
[01:49:58] or something is like you don't know the reaction.
[01:50:01] They don't, they're not under that element of control
[01:50:03] that your friends are.
[01:50:04] Now, 12 year old kid who's to say where he's at mentally.
[01:50:08] Is he saying?
[01:50:09] Apparently.
[01:50:09] Apparently he's in the vengeance mode.
[01:50:11] He is like a little rattlesnake where he's like,
[01:50:13] okay, we were taking it to that level.
[01:50:14] We'll take it to that level.
[01:50:15] He didn't know though.
[01:50:16] He didn't know what that means as far as the translation
[01:50:18] to what he can do, you know?
[01:50:20] So he's just going for, what's he going for?
[01:50:21] He's going to put a little.
[01:50:22] Bro jumping on that toehold.
[01:50:23] Yeah, yeah, all day.
[01:50:24] And cranky.
[01:50:26] Like I said.
[01:50:27] Cranky.
[01:50:28] You had that coming to you, sir.
[01:50:31] I don't know, man.
[01:50:33] I guess, no, I see, you're probably right, man.
[01:50:36] Yeah.
[01:50:37] A toehold for anyone.
[01:50:38] But to me, that escalation, I guess, you know what it is?
[01:50:41] Part of it is for me, this was just like,
[01:50:44] a way to make things more fun.
[01:50:45] Yeah.
[01:50:46] I would actually agree with that.
[01:50:47] You know, like Dean, Dean, like there's a certain level of,
[01:50:51] if Dean and I get in that zone, there's a certain level of,
[01:50:54] it's just a way to make it a little bit more fun,
[01:50:56] a little bit more consequences.
[01:50:58] Yeah.
[01:50:59] The other day, training in charcoal.
[01:51:00] Like I was having a good day and I'm like,
[01:51:02] neon, we call it park bench.
[01:51:04] Remember park bench?
[01:51:05] So your shin is in the face.
[01:51:07] You can't move and I'm like, all right, sir,
[01:51:08] straighten your legs.
[01:51:09] Like I'm trying to make him like lie against the wall straight,
[01:51:12] but he won't let me do it.
[01:51:14] So you're bending, just like your back's on the wall,
[01:51:18] you're on your side and someone's shin is in your face
[01:51:20] and your stomach, you're just like, fuck man.
[01:51:22] It's called park bench.
[01:51:23] It's worse than the other stomach is a very demoralizing
[01:51:26] situation.
[01:51:27] Jocko did it back to me, of course, but yeah,
[01:51:29] it just makes it fun, you know?
[01:51:30] And it looks real bad too.
[01:51:31] Yeah, it looks pretty bad.
[01:51:32] It's called park bench.
[01:51:34] Humiliation levels high for that one.
[01:51:36] Yeah.
[01:51:37] When you're in the bottom, you're like,
[01:51:39] you feel like, I don't know why I'm here, bro.
[01:51:41] I made several mistakes too.
[01:51:43] Yeah.
[01:51:44] For anyone not aware, a toe hold is basically grabbing
[01:51:48] like your toe and doing that, but for your toe.
[01:51:51] And it's actually, your arm is more flexible
[01:51:52] than your ankle or your knee.
[01:51:54] So it's actually, it can't be a damaging move
[01:51:56] for anyone wondering what a toe hold is.
[01:51:58] Grabbing the toe, twisting the ankle,
[01:52:00] therefore the knee as well.
[01:52:02] For the record, I don't think necessarily
[01:52:05] that you were in the wrong.
[01:52:06] In fact, I think that your son was kind of technically
[01:52:10] in the wrong, but a little rattlesnake,
[01:52:12] you can't expect him to control,
[01:52:13] he did to know the line all definitely.
[01:52:15] Who was tactical, who was strategical?
[01:52:16] Which one was tactical and strategic?
[01:52:18] Was that a strategic?
[01:52:19] Strategic versus tactical.
[01:52:20] He's trying to make him to a tougher, better fighter.
[01:52:23] Yeah, technically, was it a good?
[01:52:27] Tactically, maybe I shouldn't have let him out.
[01:52:28] I'm a long lasting lesson.
[01:52:32] Imagine the thing that I will say is like,
[01:52:36] it surprised me, right?
[01:52:38] It surprised me that he dove on the toe hold.
[01:52:41] Yeah.
[01:52:42] Cause he had the weird combination
[01:52:45] of Dean Lister and Jeff Glover game.
[01:52:48] You know, cause he would train with Dean Lister
[01:52:51] and Jeff Glover, so he had these weird heel hooks
[01:52:52] and like toe holds and then he's like doing weird,
[01:52:55] flexible things.
[01:52:56] So anyways, go watch out for that stuff.
[01:52:58] There is this element too.
[01:53:00] Where I kind of went over this with you
[01:53:01] real briefly one time in our whole life where,
[01:53:05] okay, so, and Dean, you could probably understand this too.
[01:53:08] Okay, let's say we roll, right?
[01:53:09] And I, in my mind, I just know, I believe like,
[01:53:12] you're just so much better than me
[01:53:13] and we're rolling, I'm just trying to, you know,
[01:53:15] but at the end of the day,
[01:53:16] I know like you're just so much better than me.
[01:53:18] I'm 12 years old, or me and you're, you or whatever, right?
[01:53:21] Let's say, okay, you tapped me out, Dean,
[01:53:23] you tapped me out real quick and then I'm like,
[01:53:25] oh man, cool, and then I like act like I'm gonna walk away
[01:53:29] and then I jump on your back and we start rolling again.
[01:53:31] Right, just kind of like half joking,
[01:53:33] but we still go and roll or whatever.
[01:53:35] You kind of concede a little bit where it's like,
[01:53:37] okay, I see what's going on.
[01:53:38] Like we're in a real training scenario,
[01:53:40] we wouldn't do that, right?
[01:53:41] So, Dean's gonna escalate.
[01:53:43] Yeah, and he can escalate, he can figure it,
[01:53:45] but I'm saying that.
[01:53:45] Because what you did was an escalation, by the way.
[01:53:47] Yes, but it's half joking.
[01:53:48] You see what I'm saying?
[01:53:49] It's like, hey, what's not over there?
[01:53:52] And then you jump on it.
[01:53:52] Yeah, I do that all the time.
[01:53:53] Yes, yes, exactly.
[01:53:54] The time, yeah, exactly.
[01:53:56] Exactly right, so.
[01:53:57] Yeah.
[01:53:58] Now, see, there's a legitimate, like you escalated.
[01:54:03] If you just jumped to someone's back,
[01:54:04] even though you quote unquote or joking,
[01:54:06] you still got their back and now you're trying to choke them.
[01:54:08] What's funny is that's exactly what he said.
[01:54:10] You know what I'm saying?
[01:54:10] And he was like, you indicate, I forget your words,
[01:54:13] but you indicated that like, like, don't do that.
[01:54:16] Like, we're not trying, like.
[01:54:17] Oh, you mean you did it to me for real?
[01:54:19] Yeah, oh yeah, a big problem.
[01:54:20] I used to always do that kind of stuff to you.
[01:54:21] And then I was like, hey, bro, what did I say?
[01:54:24] Did I say something?
[01:54:25] That's weird.
[01:54:25] And when we actually talked about it, you're like,
[01:54:28] you, I forget your exact words,
[01:54:29] but you weren't down for that.
[01:54:31] It's like, it's not as that bad.
[01:54:33] You founded me, you called me out.
[01:54:36] Put it this way.
[01:54:37] I was surprised because it's not like you did anything.
[01:54:41] You know, it's not like you said, hey, don't, you know,
[01:54:42] don't do that or nothing.
[01:54:43] Cause you never said anything like that.
[01:54:44] But when you indicated, oh yeah, you're not down for that.
[01:54:46] I understood, but you have to understand,
[01:54:49] I wouldn't do that if we had a real competitive.
[01:54:51] It was like, you're so much better than me.
[01:54:53] So yeah, I'm gonna jump on your back.
[01:54:55] And I still don't expect to get the better,
[01:54:56] even if I jump on your back because you're so much,
[01:54:58] it's like that attitude, I think.
[01:55:00] So that could have been what your son
[01:55:02] had in his mind a little bit too though.
[01:55:04] Seems like-
[01:55:05] You're gonna go for it.
[01:55:05] Yeah, like, I mean, obviously Dean's not gonna do that.
[01:55:08] Dean will do that.
[01:55:10] If you go for your injured, you're hell yeah.
[01:55:11] No, no, no.
[01:55:16] There you go.
[01:55:17] There's some protocols.
[01:55:18] There's some etiquettes, right?
[01:55:19] etiquette.
[01:55:19] Sometimes gets violated.
[01:55:20] Sometimes it's grayers.
[01:55:21] I may, I'm probably wrong.
[01:55:22] Kid 12 should be nicer.
[01:55:24] Should've been a nicer dad.
[01:55:27] Sorry about that.
[01:55:27] Yeah, kid.
[01:55:31] Yeah, we talked about grappling with strikes and all that.
[01:55:33] It goes through some of those things.
[01:55:35] And then it gets into like advanced ground fighting
[01:55:38] techniques and North-South escapes and North-South.
[01:55:41] Like all those things, chain attacks
[01:55:44] and how everything's connected.
[01:55:45] So, so leg attacks, Dean Lister.
[01:55:48] This section covers the advanced leg attacks.
[01:55:50] These techniques are taught as a way to change
[01:55:53] the fighter's position into a submission.
[01:55:56] Although the techniques are advanced,
[01:55:57] they still present the same amount of hazard
[01:55:59] as attacks learned at lower levels.
[01:56:02] So we got some ideas behind that as well.
[01:56:06] Reading and opponents moves.
[01:56:09] I mean, this is just a thorough,
[01:56:11] a very thorough book about combatives.
[01:56:16] And they just did a good, great job with it.
[01:56:18] And a lot of the theories that are in here just cover
[01:56:24] what we know and they do it in a very professional way.
[01:56:28] Yeah.
[01:56:28] In a very thorough way.
[01:56:29] And the last thing that it talks about is competition
[01:56:33] and the spirit of competition, the competition principles.
[01:56:39] He says, this is an important, two things.
[01:56:41] We'll finish with this.
[01:56:42] Combatives techniques are too dangerous for the fighter.
[01:56:44] Combatives techniques are too dangerous for competition.
[01:56:47] Although many techniques are too dangerous
[01:56:49] for live competition, many benefits can be gained
[01:56:51] by competing even when using a limited set of techniques.
[01:56:54] So there are some things that are too dangerous.
[01:56:58] And then it says risks of competition
[01:57:00] outweigh the benefits.
[01:57:01] Many programs have failed because there was no motivation
[01:57:04] to train.
[01:57:05] Competitions are a useful tool to motivate both soldiers
[01:57:07] and unit leaders to emphasize combatives training.
[01:57:11] So competition, very important.
[01:57:15] And there you have it.
[01:57:19] Like I said, great document, outstanding job by the Army
[01:57:24] for moving in that direction.
[01:57:26] Absolutely incredible.
[01:57:27] Yeah.
[01:57:28] And the Marine Corps has the McMap.
[01:57:29] We could go through that.
[01:57:30] The Marine Corps, the Mars Large Program,
[01:57:32] the I Know Special Operations.
[01:57:33] While I know in the SEAL teams,
[01:57:34] we moved in that direction as well around the same,
[01:57:39] actually I don't know, time-wise,
[01:57:40] but we all end up in the same place.
[01:57:43] And you know the theory here is like you gotta compete,
[01:57:47] you gotta learn, you gotta test, you gotta get better.
[01:57:50] You know what I'm saying, keep it real.
[01:57:52] Yeah.
[01:57:53] You ever say that, Echo?
[01:57:54] You ever say, hey, keep it real?
[01:57:55] I say it from time to time, yes sir.
[01:57:57] Dean, you ever say keep it real?
[01:57:59] High school maybe.
[01:58:00] I actually say keep it real.
[01:58:02] Like almost, and I kinda just throw it out there.
[01:58:05] Like if I'm, you know, someone goes, hey, what's up?
[01:58:07] I'll be like, oh, you keeping it real?
[01:58:08] Like that?
[01:58:08] You know, kinda just whatever.
[01:58:10] Sure.
[01:58:10] Kind of a throw away comment.
[01:58:11] Sure.
[01:58:13] But I was thinking about it,
[01:58:15] it's actually a good attitude to have.
[01:58:18] With combatives, with fighting, with life, keep it real.
[01:58:22] And that's what I think this does, keep it real.
[01:58:24] Don't allow for the lies.
[01:58:27] The lies.
[01:58:28] You gotta test, you gotta learn, you gotta adapt,
[01:58:31] you gotta improve, then you gotta retest.
[01:58:33] And you can do that with fighting
[01:58:34] and you can do that with everything in life.
[01:58:36] And that's how we become better fighters
[01:58:38] and that's how we become better people.
[01:58:41] Yeah.
[01:58:42] So that's my recommendation, man.
[01:58:44] Train, get out there.
[01:58:48] Anything else on combatives?
[01:58:49] Dean List.
[01:58:50] Combatives.
[01:58:51] Well, we're looking at that fine balance of training.
[01:58:55] Something you can train, you can replicate over and over
[01:58:57] without getting really injured or hurt.
[01:59:01] With also including some realism
[01:59:04] as far as getting ready for the actual threat
[01:59:06] that you will face.
[01:59:07] Such as, by the way, if you grapple on concrete all the time,
[01:59:11] it's gonna suck.
[01:59:12] Now, you wanna be aware, for instance,
[01:59:13] one time actually I fell for some reason
[01:59:17] on the concrete with my hand, broke my hand
[01:59:20] because we have mats.
[01:59:22] So I actually, I know how to fight if it's on mats,
[01:59:24] but I made a mistake.
[01:59:26] I should open my hands at the right time.
[01:59:28] These are things that have to keep in mind,
[01:59:29] but then again, you wanna train on mats, right?
[01:59:32] So why not always train on concrete?
[01:59:35] Well, because your knees would be jacked up,
[01:59:36] you hurt your head, you're gonna break your elbow eventually,
[01:59:39] but you wanna be aware of that.
[01:59:42] One thing was one of Sergeant Knows him
[01:59:45] and all the guys in Puerto Rico when I was there
[01:59:46] for a few weeks after the hurricanes working.
[01:59:49] We're just delivering water, that's all.
[01:59:52] One guy, and you probably know him, I don't know his name,
[01:59:54] but the story is the guy was an ex-tier one, whatever.
[01:59:58] I don't know, I think a seal became a cop,
[02:00:01] but he was ranked top 10 in the world with shooting,
[02:00:03] but where your hands are here and you reach,
[02:00:05] it's a quick draw.
[02:00:06] The guy's ranked top 10 in the world,
[02:00:08] it's a quick draw where your hands are above,
[02:00:10] and then he got stuck up, he was off duty,
[02:00:13] so I actually pulled a gun on him, he went like this.
[02:00:17] Because he's so trained to do that, he still won.
[02:00:19] He drew on the draw, I mean, that's how fast this guy,
[02:00:22] he's still, you're not supposed to draw,
[02:00:24] someone's already considered dumb, this guy's too fast,
[02:00:27] so he actually went from here and still survived
[02:00:30] and the guy, I don't think he made it,
[02:00:32] the guy with the loaded gun, trying to rob him.
[02:00:35] But the thing is, that training of him being so fast
[02:00:37] is good, but he didn't need to do this.
[02:00:40] He's trained so much that you shoot from here,
[02:00:41] he still won, but that's a wasted movement,
[02:00:43] think about that, so he still won.
[02:00:45] So that right there, that kind of training,
[02:00:46] I think for a quick draw is good,
[02:00:48] but then again, don't put your hands up here.
[02:00:49] Maybe that actually played into the whole,
[02:00:51] okay, he's compliant, maybe it's actually good,
[02:00:53] but I'm saying, they were saying how he still survived
[02:00:56] because he was trained, so that was just,
[02:00:58] and you know the guy, I don't know his name,
[02:01:00] but that was Sarge and all the guys in there,
[02:01:01] like it's a tight community, so I think it's good
[02:01:04] to try that middle ground.
[02:01:05] We're looking for the middle ground,
[02:01:06] you want to replicate things,
[02:01:07] you want to be able to do it in a relatively safe environment,
[02:01:09] but always be prepared for what is going to happen
[02:01:12] potentially.
[02:01:13] That's why I like what the arm is doing,
[02:01:14] it's a guideline, there's some flexibility there,
[02:01:17] I think, of course, the lake locks.
[02:01:19] Did you know the story about the Russian?
[02:01:20] You know, actually, the first time I learned
[02:01:22] lake locks before, choke holds in a seminar,
[02:01:25] it's on Nikolay Baturin, he was a Soviet champion,
[02:01:28] Osombo, Oltatar was there, other Russians were teaching,
[02:01:31] they were saying like, the reason they prefer lake walkies
[02:01:35] because, you know, big in Russia, I'm with my wife,
[02:01:39] she's very attractive, and they go to a bar,
[02:01:41] strange man grabs her inappropriately,
[02:01:44] I'm very upset, I break his arm,
[02:01:45] now he goes, the vehicle gets Kalashnikov,
[02:01:47] he comes back and dead, I'm like, bro,
[02:01:49] I'm 18 or 12, man, I don't know, fuck.
[02:01:51] But imagine the scenario, the guy grabs my girl
[02:01:54] very inappropriately, I break his leg,
[02:01:56] takes a long time to go to the vehicle,
[02:01:57] I get Kalashnikov.
[02:01:58] There's always some kind of use for it,
[02:02:02] I'm like, it makes sense, you know what I'm saying?
[02:02:05] I'm already with my wife at home sleeping in bed.
[02:02:07] I was actually supposed to lake locks before chokes,
[02:02:11] believe it or not, so yeah, it's all good to have
[02:02:12] the open mind.
[02:02:13] Well, but chokes are part of Osombo as well.
[02:02:16] Combat Osombo, in USA, illegal because this is back
[02:02:20] in Stevensville all days, they thought choke holds,
[02:02:22] you die, you know, like, you know, so in sports Osombo,
[02:02:26] I think combat Osombo is not illegal,
[02:02:29] but back then it was, you can do straight arm lock,
[02:02:32] not even, you can do Kimura Osombo.
[02:02:34] Just straight arm lock and straight knee lock, right?
[02:02:36] If you have an arm lock and I stand on my feet,
[02:02:37] it's illegal submission now, restarting your feet.
[02:02:40] So that's an escape from a submission,
[02:02:42] just standing on your feet, if I stand on it,
[02:02:43] I have nothing but my feet are the only thing
[02:02:45] touching the ground, stop, all submissions are illegal.
[02:02:47] So yeah, just different sport.
[02:02:49] And at some point they probably had some reason for that.
[02:02:52] Like, if I pick you up and now I could drop you
[02:02:55] on your head.
[02:02:56] Therefore it's not gonna work anymore.
[02:02:58] When we actually know, you let that evolve
[02:03:00] a little bit further and now I'm gonna,
[02:03:03] when you start to pick me up, I'm gonna grab your ankle
[02:03:05] and I'll hold you and keep you down.
[02:03:06] So you need to let things evolve naturally.
[02:03:09] Rules don't help that usually.
[02:03:11] I agree, I agree.
[02:03:12] Yeah, well, I won two times national champion Osombo
[02:03:15] was like 19.
[02:03:16] And the third time I was gonna get third,
[02:03:17] I was gonna be three times, but then I got in the finals
[02:03:20] and the guy, he went, mate, he stood up.
[02:03:22] So it means he give up, he's a judo guy.
[02:03:24] Got his arm, ah, mate, that's illegal submission.
[02:03:28] And my feet were crossed around the neck.
[02:03:29] They go, it was almost choker with minus one point.
[02:03:31] So I got even one minus one to zero.
[02:03:33] So I lost, so I took second place one year, unfortunately.
[02:03:36] But that's okay.
[02:03:37] So you're two time champ and then one time second.
[02:03:39] Yeah, Sombos are tough sports, good.
[02:03:40] I like Sombos.
[02:03:41] Sombos awesome.
[02:03:42] So Russian, martial arts, very good sport.
[02:03:43] And the combat Sombos, really awesome too.
[02:03:45] Yeah, MMA with the jacket.
[02:03:47] MMA with the jacket.
[02:03:48] Yeah.
[02:03:49] I mean, look at Fedor.
[02:03:50] Fedor.
[02:03:51] Fedor was a Sombos champion.
[02:03:54] Yeah, combat Sombos.
[02:03:55] So was Khabib, you know, yeah, tough.
[02:03:58] Would you say Khabib's more of a wrestler?
[02:04:00] Yeah, yeah, but he's done judo Sombos.
[02:04:02] But yeah, his style is very much,
[02:04:04] he's very suited for Noi.
[02:04:06] Just smashing people.
[02:04:08] Smash. Smash, smash.
[02:04:09] He's a tough guy, tough guy.
[02:04:11] Oh, right on, awesome.
[02:04:12] All right, well, appreciate everyone for listening.
[02:04:15] Thank you.

[02:04:53] Absolutely.
[02:04:54] And go there and check that out.
[02:04:55] I mean, that sounds like a rough deal,
[02:04:57] going to Costa Rica and doing jujitsu.
[02:04:59] How long is it?
[02:05:00] It's three, it's four days.
[02:05:02] Four days, yeah.
[02:05:03] Ah, that sounds like a good time.
[02:05:05] I know, I know.
[02:05:06] When is it?
[02:05:07] August 789.
[02:05:08] So everyone rides the six, 789, and the tenth
[02:05:11] is like a free day.
[02:05:12] So it's like four days on there.
[02:05:14] Awesome, yeah, check that out.
[02:05:15] If you want to go learn some jujitsu from the Boogie Man.
[02:05:18] The Boogie Man.
[02:05:19] Yeah.
[02:05:20] Ah, the Boogie Man, check it out.
[02:05:22] Thanks for supporting the podcast.
[02:05:23] Go to jocofuel.com.
[02:05:25] If you want to get some of these drinks, by the way,
[02:05:28] which are freaking good to go.
[02:05:30] They taste delicious.
[02:05:32] Used to be, couldn't say that.
[02:05:34] Well, some of us could.
[02:05:35] Well, you'd be like, oh, they taste good.
[02:05:36] Now, different ball game.
[02:05:38] Yeah, you're reformulated to perfection, I think.
[02:05:42] Yeah, so get yourself some of that.
[02:05:46] That's the energy drink thing.
[02:05:51] The reason we made them, look, I was on deployment.
[02:05:53] We used to drink other brands of energy drinks
[02:05:56] that were filled with sugar.
[02:05:57] You drink too many of those things?
[02:05:58] Oh, yeah.
[02:05:59] Yeah, you got like, uh.
[02:05:59] For sure.
[02:06:00] And you feel awful.
[02:06:01] It's even worse, not worse than drinking, but I mean.
[02:06:03] It's not.
[02:06:04] It's horrible for me.
[02:06:05] Yeah, it's bad.
[02:06:05] And so that's what happened on deployment.
[02:06:07] It would be like that.
[02:06:08] And that's why when at Jocofuel, it was like, hey,
[02:06:12] do you, Brian asked me, he's like,
[02:06:13] do you want to do an energy drink?
[02:06:15] And I was like, I would only want to do that
[02:06:17] if it was possible to make them actually good for you.
[02:06:19] Yeah.
[02:06:20] And then he was like, let me come up with a formula.
[02:06:22] Just start with your cranberry white tea.
[02:06:23] Is that how it started?
[02:06:24] Yeah, that's how it started.
[02:06:25] Chug with his white cranberry.
[02:06:26] Pomegranate.
[02:06:26] Pomegranate.
[02:06:27] Pomegranate white tea.
[02:06:28] What'd you say?
[02:06:29] Chai?
[02:06:29] Is that what we're saying?
[02:06:31] Cherry.
[02:06:32] White cherry.
[02:06:32] You say cranberry.
[02:06:33] OK.
[02:06:34] I don't know.
[02:06:35] Pomegranate.
[02:06:36] That was way off.
[02:06:37] Well, pomegranate's not as obvious.
[02:06:38] OK, yeah, that's true.
[02:06:39] I got you, I got you, I got you, I got you.
[02:06:42] Yeah, but there is a benefit.
[02:06:43] There's times when you need energy.
[02:06:45] Yeah.
[02:06:45] So you might as well get it.
[02:06:46] And you might as well not have a bunch of sugar in there
[02:06:48] and have an overloaded caffeine that
[02:06:49] makes you jittery and crazy.
[02:06:52] Just get something that's smooth, good, clean energy
[02:06:55] good for you.
[02:06:56] That's a Jocoh Discipline Go, jocohuil.com.
[02:06:59] You can get it at Wawa.
[02:07:00] You can get it at Vitamin Shop.
[02:07:02] You can get it at HEB down in Texas.
[02:07:04] A bunch of, we're spreading.
[02:07:06] I need to get a list.
[02:07:07] I need to get a list of all the places you can get jocohuil.
[02:07:10] So there you go.
[02:07:11] Gorge D. USA.
[02:07:12] You have demand for it in Brazil now.
[02:07:13] I know.
[02:07:14] I know.
[02:07:15] And Brazil.
[02:07:16] We got it down in Australia too.
[02:07:18] Oh, yeah.
[02:07:18] There's, we have a distributor down in Australia.
[02:07:21] So that's going forward.
[02:07:23] So yeah, we're spreading because it's good.
[02:07:27] The milk is good.
[02:07:29] The joint warfare is good.
[02:07:30] The super crills, so it's all good.
[02:07:32] And that's what people kind of know now.
[02:07:35] Like we're making the good stuff.
[02:07:37] We're making the goods.
[02:07:39] Get yourself some of that.
[02:07:40] originusa.com.
[02:07:41] Making geese.
[02:07:42] Jujitsu geese.
[02:07:43] You want to train that Jujitsu gi.
[02:07:46] You want to train that Jujitsu gi because it's going to make
[02:07:49] your all your game better.
[02:07:51] Gee, no gi.
[02:07:52] If you do gi, it's going to get better.
[02:07:55] I think your defense gets better when you wear.
[02:07:58] Because you're stuck more.
[02:07:59] Because you're stuck more.
[02:08:01] Your offense gets better when you don't have a gi on
[02:08:03] because you have to do it really tight.
[02:08:06] You have to keep advancing more with no gi because people
[02:08:09] slip out easier.
[02:08:11] You should get a gi that's made in America.
[02:08:14] Not by slave labor, but made by hardworking Americans.
[02:08:17] That's my recommendation.
[02:08:18] originusa.com.
[02:08:19] We've got some Hunt gear on the way.
[02:08:22] Actually, what's today?
[02:08:23] That should be hitting my.
[02:08:25] I should be getting some, the first production stuff
[02:08:27] coming soon.
[02:08:28] Joco, can you make a gi that's just like sandpaper?
[02:08:31] Like a sandpaper gi?
[02:08:32] I want to get really good.
[02:08:34] Really good at escaping submissions.
[02:08:35] No.
[02:08:37] Because you're not slipping on that.
[02:08:38] The origin geese are so comfortable.
[02:08:40] They're so good.
[02:08:41] They're a different thing.
[02:08:42] Spoiled.
[02:08:43] We are spoiled now.
[02:08:44] Yeah, they are spoiled.
[02:08:45] My first Jiu-Jitsu geese were like,
[02:08:47] Bloody.
[02:08:47] Nasty.
[02:08:48] Bloody.
[02:08:49] Awful to wear.
[02:08:51] So don't do that.
[02:08:52] Go to originusa.com.
[02:08:53] Get yourself some jeans, boots, Hunt gear, Jiu-Jitsu gear.
[02:08:57] We got it.
[02:08:58] We got you covered.
[02:08:58] Made in America.
[02:08:59] All of it.
[02:09:00] It's true.
[02:09:00] Good stuff.
[02:09:01] To the bone.
[02:09:02] Speaking of apparel, Joco is a store as well.
[02:09:04] It's called Joco Store.
[02:09:06] Dean Lister has his own shirt.
[02:09:07] Yeah, yeah, we're going to have this.
[02:09:08] Is it live?
[02:09:09] It's been live.
[02:09:11] Actually, we haven't really like.
[02:09:12] This one that says foot yet.
[02:09:14] OK, so it's a take off on the good shirt.
[02:09:17] I showed up at the, people were like, what the?
[02:09:20] It started off with the good shirt, which had my head on it.
[02:09:24] And then the echo shirt, which said dang, which had your head
[02:09:28] on it, which I designed.
[02:09:30] And then who designed your shirt?
[02:09:32] D.M.
[02:09:32] I came up with just, I did it like in 20 minutes.
[02:09:34] Just a joke.
[02:09:35] I wore it to the park.
[02:09:36] And he was like, oh, I would like it all.
[02:09:39] So if you don't know, Dean Lister is notorious and famous
[02:09:43] for changing the realm of jujitsu by attacking the feet
[02:09:49] and the legs and the knees.
[02:09:51] And so he made a shirt with his head on it.
[02:09:52] We made a shirt with his head on it.
[02:09:54] And instead of saying good, this is foot.
[02:09:58] Same style.
[02:09:58] It actually came out really, really good.
[02:10:02] Also, yeah, some new stuff on there.
[02:10:04] Discipline equals freedom.
[02:10:05] Standard issue.
[02:10:06] Standard issue.
[02:10:07] Many color ways.
[02:10:08] Look at you with the big words.
[02:10:10] You talk to me like I'm talking to Pete Roberts over here,
[02:10:12] talking about color ways and whatnot.
[02:10:15] Hey, you taught me it.
[02:10:15] So yeah, I'm going to roll it.
[02:10:16] Did I actually teach you that?
[02:10:17] You knew that.
[02:10:19] It sounded familiar, but you're the one who said color ways
[02:10:21] and explained it.
[02:10:22] I was like, OK.
[02:10:24] I might have heard it before, but I've never used it
[02:10:26] till just now.
[02:10:27] Thanks.
[02:10:27] That's really dipping your toes into the fashion industry
[02:10:30] when you start saying color ways.
[02:10:32] But color ways I think can be used to describe like cars
[02:10:37] or like anything.
[02:10:39] Like the scheme.
[02:10:40] Anything that could be made in multiple colors.
[02:10:42] I believe in the industry, they use the term color ways.
[02:10:48] Like sneakers.
[02:10:49] Sneakers.
[02:10:50] I think that's how I know it from sneakers.
[02:10:52] Someone's talking about a sneaker professional who was like,
[02:10:55] yeah, we got to offer these different color ways.
[02:10:57] And I said, OK.
[02:10:58] Little combos of colors.
[02:11:00] There you go.
[02:11:00] Yeah.
[02:11:01] Well, there you go.
[02:11:01] We got color ways.
[02:11:02] But anyway, yes.
[02:11:03] Call it the standard issue.
[02:11:04] Discipline equals freedom.
[02:11:05] Shirt.
[02:11:06] It's good.
[02:11:06] It's new.
[02:11:08] I didn't blow it up yet.
[02:11:09] But you know.
[02:11:09] All right.
[02:11:10] So you can check that out.
[02:11:11] Also, we got the shirt locker, which
[02:11:12] is a subscription situation.
[02:11:14] If you didn't know, new designs.
[02:11:15] Every month you get a new shirt, a new design.
[02:11:18] A little bit more creative.
[02:11:20] That's what I'm not at right now.
[02:11:21] You haven't advanced.
[02:11:23] You haven't gotten very creative on your creative description
[02:11:25] to be creative yet.
[02:11:26] You know why?
[02:11:26] Because all the creativity goes into the designs.
[02:11:28] You see what I'm saying?
[02:11:29] Not the descriptions of the designs.
[02:11:30] They'd be like a meta description.
[02:11:32] Either way, they're good.
[02:11:34] Great feedback on that one.
[02:11:35] So check that out at jockelstore.com.

[02:13:32] I cannot be held accountable for some of the things
[02:13:35] that he posts.
[02:13:38] I'd like to cross some drama.
[02:13:39] You go to some dark places in weird times.
[02:13:42] So if you wake up in the morning and there's
[02:13:44] posts from Dean Lister at 3 o'clock in the morning,
[02:13:47] hey, what's that?
[02:13:49] Be advised, right?
[02:13:50] Be advised.
[02:13:52] It's random.
[02:13:52] You might be offended.
[02:13:54] You might be disgusted.
[02:13:55] Very possible, yeah.
[02:13:56] Man, he sent me one the other day.
[02:13:58] Was that a post from Instagram?
[02:13:59] The guy getting cut in the neck?
[02:14:01] Oh, that was sent to me.
[02:14:03] Yeah, I mean, it was like a horrible scene of a guy.
[02:14:08] It looks like your typical couple drunk dude,
[02:14:11] like three or four drunk guys, going
[02:14:13] to fight another three or four drunk guys,
[02:14:15] and they're talking smack to each other.
[02:14:17] And then one of the guys pulls out a knife in that way,
[02:14:20] like, oh, I've got a knife out.
[02:14:22] I better back off.
[02:14:23] And the other guy's sort of like, well,
[02:14:24] you wouldn't do anything anyways.
[02:14:25] And it just sort of seems like this kind of innocent.
[02:14:27] It's crazy.
[02:14:28] I mean, as innocent as it could be pulling out a knife,
[02:14:30] it was that innocent.
[02:14:31] That's all it is.
[02:14:33] I'm saying, it didn't look like the intent was
[02:14:36] we're about to murder somebody.
[02:14:38] And the one dude that doesn't have a knife
[02:14:40] comes kind of like walking over like, oh,
[02:14:42] what are you going to do?
[02:14:42] Cut me?
[02:14:43] With that kind of look on his face,
[02:14:44] but not expecting anything to happen?
[02:14:46] And in a millisecond, in a millisecond,
[02:14:50] the dude like swings at him with the knife and cuts his throat.
[02:14:53] And the dude is dead in 10 seconds.
[02:14:55] He passes out in five seconds, and he's probably dead another.
[02:14:59] So another reason, don't get in street fights.
[02:15:03] Don't get in street fights.
[02:15:04] They're stupid.
[02:15:05] You get stabbed in the neck.
[02:15:06] You could break your hand, whatever.
[02:15:08] Anything in between.
[02:15:10] So don't do that.
[02:15:11] But if you want to check out Dean Lister on Instagram,
[02:15:13] there he is, Dean Lister, BJJ.
[02:15:16] On the Twitter, on the gram, on Facebook,
[02:15:18] I'm on there as well.
[02:15:20] Echo's on there.
[02:15:20] Echo's at Echo Charles.
[02:15:21] I'm at Jocko-Willink.
[02:15:22] Watch out for the algorithm, by the way.
[02:15:24] Because I think I'm going to grab you.
[02:15:25] It's going to waste an hour of your day.
[02:15:28] You're going to take an hour from you.
[02:15:29] Imagine that.
[02:15:30] A monster that came in every day and took an hour from you.
[02:15:33] Or two hours from you.
[02:15:34] Can't get it back.
[02:15:35] That's the algorithm monster that's going to get you.
[02:15:38] So that's it.
[02:15:40] Thanks to all the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines
[02:15:43] who continue to find ways to fight better in every respect.
[02:15:46] Thanks again to Matt Larson for driving this initiative
[02:15:49] in the Army.
[02:15:49] I know there's, like I said, I know.
[02:15:50] I'm sure there's a bunch of other people that helped out.
[02:15:52] I know that he was leading the charge.
[02:15:54] So salute to him.
[02:15:56] And the rest of the military personnel
[02:15:59] that are out there putting these skills to the test
[02:16:01] on the battlefields, thanks for what you do.
[02:16:03] Also, thanks to police and law enforcement.
[02:16:07] Do what you can to get out there and train.
[02:16:10] You need it.
[02:16:11] We need it.
[02:16:13] Also, firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,
[02:16:16] correctional officers, border patrol, secret service.
[02:16:18] All the first responders, thank you
[02:16:20] for keeping us safe here in our own country.
[02:16:24] And everyone out there, go train.
[02:16:29] Train whatever you can.
[02:16:30] Train wrestling, train boxing, jujitsu, moitai, train judo,
[02:16:34] and sombo, and train with guns and knives and bow and arrow.
[02:16:38] And test and learn and adjust and get better.
[02:16:41] And it will make you better in every aspect of life.
[02:16:45] Just go train.
[02:16:49] And until next time, this is Dean and Echo and Jaco.
[02:16:54] Thanks again.
