This story is so cool for me, because that's like just classic nail aviation, what I always loved about flying with the Navy in the Marine Corps was he's talking about that missile, he was talking about in training, like the book says you can only shoot the missile from the back of an airplane, that's the rule, and that's how it works, and they tell you, and the coolest thing about flying with guys in the Navy, they're like, I don't care what the book says, I'm gonna go try this, see if it works, and this missile, which is on paper and designed to only shoot the back of a jet, because the engines in the back, that's probably heat, these guys figured out I could shoot this thing, we call it four quarter in the nose, and the best part about that is if you launch this at a MiG, I guarantee you, he would do exactly what you described, because nobody else would do that, because the book says you can't do it, so I just like listening to your stories of, I don't care what the book says, I'm gonna try this, see if it works, and that big giant intake probably replicated a MiG-21's big nose, that big giant engine right in the front of the airplane, that's pretty cool thinking, I like that. Not my squadron, no, the ship lost, I don't know, four or five, maybe more, A7s, no A6s, A6 guys, I think, were pretty cagey, A7 drivers, they all tended to be, seemed to me, younger guys, in the wardrobes, sitting there, with the guy, I said, man, I had a hell of a time tonight, I was mixing it up with these guys, they had a 57 millimeter in a cave on the side of a hill, I don't know how they got it up there, but I made it, I came back around and gave them another load of 20 millimeter, I thought, really, I said, you know, you're sitting that far across the wardrobes table, I said, do you realize what the aim point is? Oh, it's the airplane, I said, no, no, no, the aim point's right between your eyes, you're nuts, put a 500 pound bomb into that hole, if you, any good as a bomber, you can do that, put a bomb into his cave, that's the end of that gun, no, it was more fun, I went around a third time, and I said, you're crazy, he's gonna shoot you down, you're gonna feel really stupid, you throw away your weapons, is what you do when you get shot down, you have a responsibility to, in your book, you talk about things that are worth it and things that are not worth it, and I have to tell anybody who's willing to, including my old skipper or somebody like that, I said, I have a favorite switch position down by your left knee in the F4, it's an all, it does all the bombs, doesn't, the missiles, the missiles stay, but the bombs, you have singles pairs, doubles, cluster, all, and then all, flip, all, this is bad here tonight, I don't wanna be here, I'll be back tomorrow, but for tonight, all, see if you can eat this load, there's only six of them for seven, six, what, six, 500 pounders? yeah, that's shit going by from the back, and most of it right there, because they had time to know where you were, and they could hear you in orbit, and now this guy was over here, and suddenly he got silent, that means he's in the dive, so that means he's gonna be over here, and turn their guns around, more over the guy with the auditory, have a dozen paper towel tubes taped together, he can hear you, even if you got your engines at idle, I think, that's my private theory, I don't know if that's true or not, but anyway, that's when they would open up on you, and yes, every night, no question, every night, anytime you were there, they would blast away, and... So there are places in the ship where the air conditioning really did work beautifully, but we got visited by ABC or CBS News or something like that, and they were on Hancock, which was in the Gulf at the same time at that time, and one of these guys said to me, boy, we could see this ship on the horizon, and he said, this ship is nice, Hancock, but next week we're going down to get aboard the big guy. And I said to Jimmy, I said, when, my best friend, I said, so that you can claim we got him with a sparrow, we won't know which, because as soon as that Sidewinder leaves, I'm gonna flip to, because you got the pepper on it, I'm gonna flip to radar and pull the trigger a second time. So, and you look down, and the max low altitude speed on the F-4, indicated airspeed, was I think like 740, and you look at the indicated airspeed, and he's not in burner, we're doing 790, indicated relatively close to the ground, and we're smoking along here, and then you come back, and they know what you've been doing, although it's a combat situation, you're not gonna know what they were complaining, but I have a picture of an F-4 coming aboard with, and it's big dense in all three tanks, because you've been up there, if not at the mark, really close to it, and the dynamic pressure dense the fronts of the tanks, and maybe they don't do that anymore, maybe put some sort of a reinforcement on the front end of the tanks, but those tanks were not reinforcing the noses, and they were all dented from doing stuff like that. You pull back just a little bit, turns off the, just a little bit, so actually before you fly the airplane, they'd want you to get familiar with the cockpit and so forth, and they say to you, realize that this system is there, and if it's quiet, you can hear the micro switches click, and you can't, but you just gotta touch them, and you click it, click it, very faint, but they're in there, and it turns off the roll stab, so here you are your first time out with this thing, and you touch it a little bit, and it turns off the micro stab, the stabilization in pitch, and it does one of these, and because you go the other way, and it keeps it off, and so forth, and then you push it a little bit this way, and it turns that off too, and then you go back, and so forth. But the F-A-18 is a modern airplane, the F-4 was just an airplane that Mr. McDonald said, I want a monster, and I wanted to do this, that, and the other thing, and if you have a problem with it, it won't do that, add a system to do that, and they did, and they kept on doing that, and that's what you got, and you got a hell of an airplane, but my favorite quote about the F-4 was a Marine, and one of the books, as you might suspect, I have airplane books and whatnot, and he said, I flew the F-4 for three years, and it never killed me. And he had a 37 millimeter gun too, in both those airplanes, and you better not shoot the pass too soon, because he's gonna be firing that thing on a head on, no matter which one it is, at you, and you got a piece of bulletproof glass in the front of you, in the older airplanes, the F-4 you did, so it shouldn't hit you in the face, I guess, but he's liable to ruin your radar, which could be a problem, if he gets close to you with that head on, but as soon as you pull that trigger, he's never saw anything like that in his life, and he's been told that the F-4 has to get behind you, so don't worry about it, and that's what I always, and I said, Jimmy, you gonna be able to, and we get that MiG with a sparrow, because that's the, the radar operator's missile, is a sparrow. I think my idea is that, if you took a bunch of paper towel tubes, and put tape around them, and put a microphone behind them, and then you put that on the mount of a gun, where the barrel got overheated and it warped, so we got this gun mount over here, we don't use it, put that auditory search finder thing on the gun, because as soon as I turn it over there, and I can hear it, I got headphones on, and I can hear, there he is, oh, I lost him, no, I got him back again. I said to David, the only, my real claim to fame here, because I'm pretty ordinary actually, was the fact that I was there when Sam Leeds walked around VF 121 and said, we're going to start this thing and maybe you might want to be part of it because we don't want to have any more foreshot down by MiG-17s, not so much 21s, but MiG-17s. and then you do that and climate maintain 1200 feet or 1000 feet or whatever it is and turn left to bus and so on, then you're on the downwind and then they will, you have more planes coming in, coming down from the holding chute if you will and they'll squeeze you in in the middle there or they'll take you way down till one guy is early and one guy's a little, you push over from those altitude at an exact you're supposed to to the second timing from the sack and some guys are a little bit early, guys are a little bit late. One of the few ones, he came in on me trying to suck me into a, what's called a scissors, it's two airplanes who do this, one trying to be slower than the other guy and I rolled over the top on him and went to Burner and I was standing there upside down above him in Burner and he said, I can still in my mind I see him looking up at me and he said to me, I can't believe you're doing this, which is the wrong thing to do. And he said, they were looking for a guy like you at a theater in Baltimore that I am going to, he said. You make yourself present, because you're making all that noise right over here, over the crossroads, and they know, the gunners all know, as the trucks are over there, and they know that, and they know that you know that, because they can hear the fact flying around too. He said, well, most people put in navigator for second and then something like, I don't know, auxiliary aviation or something like that. and then he would go drop a second one, and he said, do you have my two markers, and you'd say, yeah, okay, and he said, now, they are northeast and southwest, so remember they're northeast, they're not north and south, they're northeast and southwest, and what you want is on a triangle pointed to the north, but to the northeast, and sort of, and there's a crossroads there, can you see the crossroads, and sometimes you could on a moonlit night. I think there was one guy who was a lieutenant commander, but anyway, flying with him, flying, I discovered I could fly like a bird, because at that point in your training or in your experience level, you start to get that good at it, and I thought, holy smoke, I'm doing this, this way. So I said, when that big guy sees, maybe the Sidewinder won't guide, maybe it'll miss him by 30 feet, and then the kill radius is only 25 and stuff like that. And the LSO has probably went to the CO and said, hey, you got to talk to this guy because he's going to kill himself. So the other daughter said, I'll take him out and she had not actually said, she said, if you go, I'll buy it my own ticket. Dan Peterson is a little bit removed, a little bit standoffish, sort of guy, not a bad guy or anything like that, but a little bit standoff. Well, like, as Skepper said to me, we want to send somebody over to Thailand, and since you have Air Force experience, would you like to do it? He was a teenager, yeah, and he said, you always, fortunes of war, you figured the other guy's going to, or you can always jump out, you know. Yeah, I had a guy on the podcast named Dean Ladd, who's a Marine in World War II, and he went into a bunch of different islands, but he was talking, he's going into Tarawa, and I'm like, were you nervous going in? That's a shallow, it's especially in a place like that where ground fire, not the Sam's, although I know Sam's are always considered, but AAA, like a 30 degree airplane's a big giant airplane. Guy said to me way back, in Kingsville, I teach you to let it roll off on a wing, let the nose fall, acquire the target, adjust a little bit, and now you're watching the altimeter and so forth. I figured I called a guy one time and he said, I don't have it, but I know who does have it. I went there and it got a Marine, no, Air Force Trooper, big guy, big guy with a sidearm at a little lectern inside the door. What's that ticking, what's that thumping, whatever, the engines don't sound right, you can hear all that even with your helmet on, so I figured, and warning light panels for galore, so I figured, turn it out, the human eye takes, you probably know this, it takes about 30, yeah, half an hour, the same length of time takes the sun to set, so after half an hour, you can see everything on the ground, and the facts talking about that, grove of trees, I said, my credit, I said, you don't know me, but I have, I called those and so and call him and you could call him, I don't have to do that. So at any rate, a year after, maybe 10 months after I lost the election, I get to talk to a guy named Bob Asher, who was a little bit of a character and well-known in Pennsylvania politics, because he took the heat and went to jail for something he didn't do, but probably to protect a Pennsylvania senator or maybe one of the governors, I don't know. He was, the night I talked to him, he was the speaker at a dinner, and he had the place in the palm of his hand, and then you figure, he's probably winding up about now, and he said, you've been such a great audience, I'm gonna sing a song for you, and I thought, oh, the poor man, he's gonna ruin everything. He was, I mean, he had to strap it on, so that was, first time, I felt that way, truly felt that way, fly like the airplanes attached to you, and the other way around, because when he, you wanna say a mile or a mile or a quarter of a beam, what happens if he turns into you? She said, I said, I hope you got more than $5,600 for it. A week later, the local guy that I knew very well was a whole political office called me up and he said, how'd you like to be a register of will? And then four hours later, he came to me in the passenger way and said, we're not going to do this, we got to change. Like I have, I have a part of my fridge where I have one of each kind of opened where I'll just go like take a sip, take maybe two or three sips, you know, just during the day, just to fly by. He ended up getting gut shot in Tarawa, and was lucky, a couple of his Marines disobeyed the order just to keep going, and they grabbed him and threw him back on a ship, so I think that's the common mental state of the young man in combat is I really feel sorry for the other guys that are going to have trouble out here and get wounded and killed. I said, but the thing about Jenny, the thing that people want is something you can do that most people can't. And if you don't fly, you have to be here at six, at 430 in the morning to man up and run the airplanes out and make sure everything on the airplane, systems, engines and whatnot, and the radar works because you're going to have an experienced, good guy in your back seat just for this morning exercise so that when we put two, four airplanes out on the parking ramp, they all work and all the radars work.
