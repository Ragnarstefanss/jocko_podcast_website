and you actually want those things you mentioned your dad got out of jail when you're 13 years old and this sounds and when you talk about in the book this is sort of like kind of a little bit of like sounds like you're living the dream a little bit you're down there in Georgia for the summers you got horses you got four wheelers you got jet skis and you're working hard so that was like a good experience you're learning a lot definitely a little best of both worlds going to grow up run wild in the alleys of Chicago that's kind of where we hung out in the alleys playing basketball playing whatever getting in trouble and No I mean like the body weight I got taped my whole career because if you're like if you're bigger and stronger you're going to get taped because you know like for me the max body weight or something for a guy that's five eleven was like you know one seventy eight or something maybe like one eighty two or something like that It was every time I came home and it was for the first maybe 10 years and it was is like Donald Rumsfeld Dick Cheney George Bush oil I'm like mom where's the detergent like I came home to do my laundry and you're yelling at me about Donald like I don't know anything about all these kind of things. You know, it's like, whether it be for a good cause or it's more for like constructions, just like, like if you, you know, when you lift weights now. You will not give give a seal that's you know in his first platoon give him a squirt gun and you give him that squirt gun and he's going to like immediately have the best muscle discipline and you've ever seen like he won't point it at his kid to squirt me like it's like a physical And so I can just cut this little corner and be like well you know like I've been here for 15 years like do I really need to do like I'll generally kind of get it in the box And it's all like, uh, all really manicured these nice paths and it just looks like this is like the most like, like Jurassic Park scenario. And it's like, okay, has anyone ever thought of like, wow, what this is going to do to like a, you know, 17 year old kid or a person or whatever, if they drink one of these every day, which is kind of the goal. I looked at him and exhaled I don't know sir that file is deleted There was little else to say so I turned away and went back to debrief of my platoon I was tired and sad and likely can suck concussed, but I had a job to do Zach always did his and more I could do the same bringing out the collective narrative in the debrief began to bring back the details for me But Zach standing over me ready to kill to protect me stood out in stark relief from the start That vision Zach silhouetted against the dust still swirling from the explosion that flattened me color and detail becoming clear as my consciousness Returned is what is one I still see sometimes as I wake It says something about Zach as a man as a battlefield interpreter and as my friend it was a common it was common to hear Americans say of the Afghans We can't want it more than they do But it often seemed we did Zach was a huge exception He was not a soldier, but he was there to fight He understood our missions in a way that other interpreters did not Most interpreters were like specially items in our packs Inert and just riding along until it was time to employ them for their purpose But Marines are utility players capable of addressing a wide array of circumstances and expected to prevail in each Like a Marine Zach was an active member of 1st platoon He did not shy away from any danger. oh I should go do something about that no idea what that was and then like oh I Navy Marine Marine guys I like those guys they've got something and then like oh no one wants to be infantry I want to be and so all this stuff is just a theory He was done he was done it's like Dick Winters you know Dick Winters after everything he did in World War two they brought all they got recalled for Korea he showed up to the boat there in San Francisco and they're like hey if you're a combat vet from World War two you don't have to go and he's like cool but they can perform it that you know like you can't measure like that you know where it's like And like, it's got the shake still from, and General Kelly, you know, they like to drink PBR and like have a beer, Tom. You know I'd always been a rail ski like it when I would go up in waist size I was like it's guess it's time for new pants like it was nothing was clicking that I was getting fat. like oh they look like they're going to be doing some finance and some working on engine engineers and like this kind of thing. but it's not like the kind you're measuring body fat or nothing like this and be like hey you're over you know 14 percent or whatever. So what you end up with like in a seal platoon especially like a new guy in a seal platoon they're they're a robot for a little while you want to make sure that their weapons always painted pointed safe direction they know exactly where the other people are during a during an immediate action drill that they're doing the safe thing But when you read about him and how he treated the troops and how much he cared about them, um, you know, Hackworth the same way, like the, like the hardest dudes you could ever imagine and yet they would completely, um, know when they were pushing too hard, pull back the reins, protect their guys from stupid shit. I was like Rob Kelly son of a general was prior enlisted I actually went and looked that up because it was amazing right that this guy whose dad is general was like oh cool what are you doing I'm enlisting in Marine Corps like hell They can go they can go right up to the edge that berm that they know if they go any further they're going to cut off someone else's field of fire they know that so you get them so well trained and so well disciplined that they end up with a bunch of freedom and then that goes all the way up the chain now the guys that have got two platoons under the belt they can start making little adjustments with their whole fire team and then eventually you get a platoon commander that goes oh here's the rule right now and here's what I should do It's a mob and just like any other mob like they can get going in a certain direction And your job as a leader is to make sure that the direction that the mob is going is correct And the two classic examples kind of ones you mentioned a little bit but my team does great And you looked at the Navy guys and said they look like they're going to be engineers and these guys over here look like they're going to carry machine guns and you're a machine gun carrying type of dude. It reminds me of, it doesn't remind me, but it's similar to like the orange where it's like you, I'm not saying you can't go wrong cause of course you can go wrong, but it's one of those ones where it's like, it was good, but I just wasn't surprised that it's good. And I just like everything in me wants to cry for this Marine, but everybody's, you know, as a leader, like you said, everybody is looking at you, how you're going to respond to this thing. you know all my mom my sister and I all slept in the same bed for like the first five six years when we got back in a room in my Aunt's house I mean it was it was tough meanwhile as that's going on your dad ends up going to jail when you're eight years old how's that go down I think I'm staying and then like you know my tour comes up again like okay come back be a fireman do I think I'm gonna stay in. And you know, when you even hear about Zach like hanging drywall 12 hours a day, it's like this guy's going to make something happen. That means they get more money when you, you know, like, so it makes, it's weird because it makes sense on one hand, but on the other hand, it's so like sinister, you know. But then when you realize what part of the process it is, you kind of like now as an adult and we talked about this before offline or whatever where when you have doms, you kind of have like, whether it be from Jiu-Jitsu or lifting, you kind of have a better feeling because you know you're sort of in the game. It sounds like you were a little unimpressed in the book with the Navy when you like what you had in your mind for what military service would be like. And like when you have a purpose and that is being a warrior or combat leader and you're good at that thing, there is nothing more rewarding or satisfying than when you get to, and so got right back in the game and right back in my first firefight, I'm like, okay, here's what I don't do. So then the SEALs made their own PRT that just to make sure you don't have anybody that's not you know because there's no fast SEALs like just to enforce that rule without having to tell anybody like here's the PRT if you don't pass it you got to get on the run program homie. you describe it in here going back to the book here you say I followed my mom into a room after dinner and sat there while she tried to decompress from her day she was folding clothes and she tried to talk to me I was non responsive she looked me straight in the eye Thomas tell me what's wrong I was suddenly crying so hard I couldn't stand I lay on the floor I just want a dad I said over and over through the gasps and sobs eventually my best friends dad started taking me to the father son events he wasn't my father but at least I was with a man who cared about me I want an autographed picture of Chicago Bears wide receiver Tom Waddle at one father and son banquet winning that 8 by 10 black and white headshot capped off the best night of my life then my best friends dad hung himself in his garage My father was in prison three states away my supplemental father figure killed himself and most of the men in my life were unaccountable and made me mistrustful of men and it also left me such that now when I perceive a void or a gap I feel a compulsion to fill it to make it better put less positively I'm unable to resist trying to bend a situation to my will I've never been the smartest or most talented guy in any room I've been in I mean, and maybe I won't put into words as good, but the idea that like, you know how when you feel pain, the natural instinct is to be like, oh, it's pain. It's so funny how like we had like a little stockpile, like a pre-sale stockpile. I know that I have a lot to learn about leadership I know that I need to listen to my squalors I know all these things I also know that I could leave this platoon today and that is a great testament to the infantry officers course. And so like the midshipman kind of, when I would teach a naval academy, would kind of like, you know, bitching complain about different aspects of leadership or timing. And she says like like don't you know are you going to be able to stay here longer I think of like, if you think of it, it gets like the river sticks, you know, we had crossed the river sticks and we're living in Hades. I just know that like it seems like they got their shit together And like the next morning, like the day we're gonna get on the buses that night, but Rob says, hey, you know, stop by, have some lunch. Just attacking and shooting machine guns and rockets all day with this group of savage men and for the first time I said like yes like you've made the right decision and this is these are your people this is your shit and. And he figures out a plan in in like when the sun goes down he starts to freeze he's like I'm out of here how can I get out of here so what he plans to do is he's going to dig a hole big enough to put his leg in and he's going to toss a grenade into this hole and blow his leg up get some shrapnel and go home. And there was years ago by where the guy a guy can you know I had a trip wasn't there for the PRT because like a command like the SEAL team would do one PRT a year. And I'm like, man, if Cam can go down, I mean, like, and I hadn't, I was good in a firefight, I could still kind of compartmentalize and focus on the thing that I needed to focus on in that moment to make the right decisions. You try to bite in the MREs like breaking your teeth off like all are like cold leather gears. You got troops to lead, you got stuff to do, like you don't have, and what really what I found is like, I didn't have the courage to turn them back on. And so if physical courage if you rely less on physical courage through battle drills and immediate action drills and close order drill you you you rely less on moral courage when you have discipline thoughts habits and actions in your life and so that that way it's not I don't have to say I don't need to put myself in a position where my moral courage has to carry the day for me to do get up in the morning to like my boss like we have to be at work at 6 30 p.t.n. And and you know I'm so jacked up like you know more f'd up than a football bat as they'll say you know I probably needed an extra go.
