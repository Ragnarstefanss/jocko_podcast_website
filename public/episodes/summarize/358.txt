but you're not going to just instantly detonate in cartwheel you're going to you're probably going to pull out of it and go dang something's wrong some indicators will pop up the jet might start to deteriorate over time maybe seconds or minutes but the scenario of being in a dive being shot at by bullets and then just like literally up until sitting here listening to explain it I never fully piece that together in my head in fact the pilot was like I don't understand and I wasn't going to ask him like can you explain this better because I couldn't follow it when he explained the fuse the FMU he called it which I think is like fuse mechanical unit literally just the thing that detonates the bomb as soon as he said that it all made sense like a bomb literally blew up underneath his jet he probably had a string of bombs probably picture two or three in a row like the old videos of bombs coming out the bottom bomb blows up blows up the next bomb blows up the next bomb probably a hundred feet away from his jet or less literally blows up his airplane from the bombs detonating and he's talking about tumbling that makes so much more sense so if you want to come to that you better sign up now the one that we're Atlanta sold out everything we do so as I sells out so if you want to come to any of our events go to that's on that's on front dot com if you have a company you want us to work with your company helping you with leadership as long front dot com we also have online training academy you can get better you don't have to create courses from memory in a prison camp to get better you can go to extreme ownership dot com can learn about leadership from us we don't have to hit a tap code thankfully we can just sit there and answer your questions in a live session or you can go through the courses that we have on there learn about life and if you want to help service members active and retired you want to help their families gold star families check out marclise mom mom only she's got an incredible charity organization if you want to donate or you want to get involved go to america's mighty warriors dot org and don't forget about my kfink who's up there in the wilderness reintroducing veterans to their soul heroes and horses dot org once again if you want to follow leah ellis or you want to connect with leah ellis leading with honor dot com he's got an instagram at leading with honor he's got a twitter leon leah ellis facebook at leon in parentheses leah ellis and his linkedin is leah ellis the books leading with honor engaging with honor and of course captured by love is new one i don't know what's coming out but it's coming out soon to be on the lookout for that one they he wrote it with a love expert named greg goddack somehow i didn't get tapped as the love expert holly mckay she wrote an awesome book rest her life to write that book pick that one up especially with everything that's going on the world right now it's good stuff to understand you know all the books I've written you might want to check those out especially the kids books come on come on maybe you're like too late to save maybe like discipline equals freedom it's not gonna help me because I'm just too I'm already just a disaster but don't let your kids go off the path break the cycle break the cycle get your kids on the path at a minimum look should you get on the path yes you should get discipline equals freedom field manual should get that for your your your your cousin and your dad and your mom right do that at but at a minimum get your nephew and your kid Totally you feel it like I guess as I'm talking to the story I think I remember I feel it in my chest more than anything like a tightening or some some you know I guess it's almost like an exhilaration or something anxious but dude like I said man I almost don't even want to tell a story after listening to what he's talking about not to mention to I didn't fully in reading the book I wasn't able to piece together what what happened until he explained it. So if I, you know, Dave's got a project that's due and it's going to look the client wants it by by Wednesday and I know it's going to impact the way Dave's, you know, his weekend is going to ruin his weekend. oh I'm at I'm at 6,000 feet closing with the earth I'm going 500 knots I'm gonna get out of here just gonna get out of the airplane not like you know which is what it really is well whatever that's the same thing with putting rounds down range and same thing with putting hands on someone you know it's like this is a ready to drink they're out there they're in while while we're making them as many as we can right now which is not easy because the demand signal you know we had these at camp at jujitsu camp we got enough for like six days or whatever they were gone in two days people were just drinking them back to back to back to back to back to back they're awesome get some if you want to get some go to jacquafuel.com go to Wawa go to vitamin shop and get yourself some we're gonna make as many as we can and we're upping the production all that stuff because people want things that are healthy and you will supply one thing that we're supplying better is discipline go the drink oh you know you got to be like you know you might have to get out of the airplane whatever right you guys always say that kind of stuff too though but like what give him rounds down range And to be honest with you like my pilot brain like this this doesn't fully make sense to me not that I've known was like to get shot down I'm talking about why do the like why the airplane did that really didn't make sense because I know a lot about triple and it seems like even that get out of the airplane it kind of seems like hey let's not make it it's a huge deal we all know that already but let's not make it a huge deal kind of a thing and think about it that so we can navigate through the scenario same saying it's almost like it's on purpose and it happened to a bunch of people and he's telling that I had I had never I had never heard those I did not know that was the face in my nope did not know that from you know early fandom days mid to late 60s big cover up that fuses predates anything I ever flew with you know our fuses were super reliable we knew how to program they worked I don't think I ever once heard a story of a fuse prematurely detonating a weapon that we lost an airplane we had you know different mechanical failures here and there but nothing like that certainly not an endemic thing where multiple airplanes were lost as a result it's awful sucks you know I noticed remember the thing was on the ground podcast we were talking about somebody is using the terms putting hands on yeah are you gonna get one of those I've probably outgrown the vet that was a you know my kid childhood dream and like young you know early 20s but don't they just real people back in my going back to one on that that new ones legit looks awesome and if you're if you got hit by triple a in your jets what we call it kind of like kind of falling apart underneath you you're like hey man buckle up dude we got about 30 seconds you're gonna be fine so the fact that it was catastrophic and had no choice that was the difference it would have been better had he been shot down by triple a because he probably could have just pulled the thing out waffled up motor shuts down catches on fire You know, it's like, you know, they were upset that they had to fly with somebody else in the airplane with had a stick, you know, because they had been single-seaters so long. So, you know, if you get a guy like McCain, who's the last in his class at the Naval Academy and, you know, has a reputation for kind of causing problems, that's exactly the kind of guy you want in these cases. and well you know the people you know the kids you know get away the warrior kids series get a mic in the drag just do that do them a favor a lifelong favor as on front we have leadership consultancy we solve problems through leadership we have the next muster is in Orlando April 3rd through the 5th yeah that's like I'm probably just like so guilty of like 47 different little statements like that but didn't even until you brought it up I was recounting when did I say that that's how you say it It was, we needed all different kinds of people there, but we were all similar in a lot of ways because you can't go through flight school, you know, physically, mentally, go through all the, you know, go through all the requirements of flight school, go through the training and then become a fighter pilot without having something similar to the other people. I'm doing I think I'm doing like just some what I would consider like basic dumb bomb dropping bombs at 45 degree dive you're probably going on 350 knots something like that. And you know, in fact, one guy was in solitary confinement and he wanted to know about, he wanted, he wanted to know about Shakespeare. This digital flight control thing I'm like whoa I pulled back and like the jet didn't respond for probably a very short period of time and in that moment you have these thoughts of like OK this isn't good and you're in a dive. That, I think, helps you get through these things and it seems like that helps so many people in the camp, both when it's happening, right after it happens, and then, you know, I'm sure we'll talk about it, the way that you all came back. but so you need a different guy now same saying you gotta be I don't know somebody's training you get to yes somebody that's working out getting up early somebody that's getting up early getting after it there you go yeah chocolate field calm origin USA calm get stuff made in America get shirts get belts get boots get jeans get stuff made in America get stuff made in America that's what I'm talking about those new So you got these guys, you got, you know, it's like a good attack dog, right? You might be a little bit, have a tendency, you know, I talk about the SEAL teams, like there's a, there's like a criminal element to your brain for a lot of guys. and i am at jockel willink watch out for the algorithm because it'll grab you and thanks once again to colonel leah ellis for his service and sacrifice into all those p o w's who faced such horror but maintained their honor and therefore the honor of our great nation and thanks to all the military personnel out there you signed the dotted line and swear to uphold the constitution regardless of what you face so thank you for protecting us and our way of life and the same goes to the rest of our police force law enforcement firefighters paramedics emt's dispatch dispatchers correctional officers border patrol secret service all first responders you all swear an oath to protect us and we thank you for your service as well and everyone else that's out there when you're facing something tough like life because life is tough remember the stockdale paradox that is that you can never confuse faith that you're gonna prevail in the end so you gotta believe that you're gonna prevail in the end Was it, you know, for like guys going into ground combat, you kind of remember the first time you rolled outside the wire? They're going to know that I trust them that are going to know I appreciate them because I'm giving them more autonomy. Speaking of leadership and you know, as I as we've gone through this book, this is a book about leadership and and a book about, you know, what the human being can come up against. you know I might have I know kind of a little bit of terminology of FMU and like you know I just like the look then I bought the wire wheels you know good deal Dave Burke had a Corvette And we'd see a lot of Army helicopters would come through and pass refuel and there in Moody and going, you know, this was when the Army, Airborne, an Army, whatever the helicopter groups were called, really got going. And they're going to be better performers at work they're going to be better people at home they're going to be better parents and that sort of thing. And, you know, I often talk about, you know, if you want to get through some trauma that you've been through, you got to own it and say, hey, this is what I did. And I mean I mean how much I'm going through the book like what part of my going to actually read right. Sam's are totally different story too this is a big giant missile going to you know mock a couple and they blow up like they literally are designed to explode triple A doesn't do that they're just bullets That sense, I mean, I don't know what it's like to be a fighter pilot, your description of going back seat at fours as part of the standard continuum to cycle up front.
