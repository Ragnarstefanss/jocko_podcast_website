It's a what when when you were in school are you into school you're getting good grades getting decent grades, you know into the sports, you know Football wrestling and then track kind of drop track off at the end and just concentrated on football and wrestling You know like school, but not crazy into it, you know like the math, you know decent grades. um, you know two e-fives you had to bring us a chief on board to Um certify the shot with good and safe and all that stuff, but we were just you know, you know, it was good, you know made Uh, you know adept winners got involved with it It's like the Secretary of State and uh, Secretary uh, uh, Justice uh, All wrapped into one dude and you know as a chief, um, you get to talk to these folks and you're talking about how to Develop, you know ranges in Panama or wherever But man at the end of the day Your brain is tired Because all the colloquialisms for the different countries, um, They all come into play you say one thing one country that that means something else in another another country And you can get yourself in trouble You know, but but it's a whole different animal once you get to speak Uh, but uh, so the total time at DLI was how was the total time at DLI learned in Spanish? We were training our folks up and you know, we were in the middle of 30 dudes um, you know plus on this uh hike Uh, and uh, uh, we never saw anything, you know, uh, we went in dry hole and and back out this marine uh lieutenant Read a book were seals Don't wear socks Uh, and uh that dude's feet were cas wrapped Just trash I made the mistakes I made and uh Then it's a you know, so I didn't make it through and then where do you want to go and uh, you know seal team four uh, just because the reputation and uh, um, I wanted to get to the east coast You know so they I think I put you know two and four and they said they'd give them whatever I wanted You got to vote it in and, uh, yeah, you know, uh, I do reach across the aisle, you know, and, uh, you know, I'm, you're, you're typical Republican, uh, conservative, you know, doesn't have purple hair. and they had, uh Uh a pistol course we were running there was a pipe you had to crawl through that had bullet holes in it and uh, you know, you know dug on my knee and you know, I I never even used lidocaine because I wasn't I taught that in core school You know, and I hadn't been through Um the empty course where you got all that Yeah, you know, we had k-pox, you know, a big giant, you know horribly uncomfortable life jackets, uh, and uh Wow now they got helmets, you know, I dude I I noticed they took the stump jump completely out I'm explaining to you like, you don't know, even though I do know that you do know energy drink usually has sugarcane, uh, uh, preservatives, you know, poison. still Yeah, uh Yeah, you know, um Remember remembering all the wild things about about hell week, you know, you know, what was your worst, you know, thinking hell week Tuesday I've talked to the clients a lot, you know, they need to build rapport and be kind to their security personnel and their drivers and things so that, you know, they love them, you know, their family, because you're asking them to take, you know, when I'm, it's, the deal is, I'm gonna stick my neck out for these people and this father's gonna risk his life for these folks, and so are those folks. but but I'm there and uh, uh, the triage nurse, you know says, uh, hey, I'm ed, you know, I'm uh, uh, You know, so yeah, just dropped me off at Balboa I'll get it, you know, and they you know did a couple, you know Basically you get into going to Balboa on a saturday night What do you got there a whole bunch of colds a whole bunch of you know And if you nod it off You're gonna get a jalapeno You know, so ed being from michigan and you know roast beef and mashed potatoes, you know Peppers like the ultimate spice and you sparingly my mom's, you know, french canada. And so that was awesome to get those lessons learned and just different breaking points, you know, how long someone can take it and, you know, everyone's gonna eventually break, but, you know, how much, you know, how long are you gonna go? You know, there's, you know, uh, districts, you know, three quarters of a million people, main smaller being there's six, it's 680 plus thousand, you know, can't reach all those folks. And the folks that are augmenting us, they just have this militant look about them, you know, including having sleeves rolled up, and like, you know, even, you know, cargo panties, you know, pants and stuff. And a lot of ways to do overseas, you know, I'm making sure the law enforcement that's there is that they, and I don't know them very well, so it's, you know, because we're jumping into a lot of things, but I'm making sure they feel right, you know, that they're not nervous themselves. And it hasn't changed much, you know It's that's one thing I miss from you know jumping over to the east coast was seeing these young frog, you know Men wannabes just get after it and and try and figure out, you know How to negotiate their obstacles on their own time after training and yeah, You know, if you're there a long time, I'm making sure the driver is the same feel today as he had yesterday and the day before, you know, so that, you know, he wasn't threatened and told to make a left-hand turn, you know, when he's supposed to be going straight. You know, you know, lion's lope, you know, the uh You know getting mad at my paddle. Hey, cool it uh, you know, they'd like um Um Pull comp, you know, that was another one where you know, and I had uh, um One of the mean instructors We never had a new TV ever we fixed all those old tube TVs, you know and change the channel with the pliers, you know We fixed our cars, you know from fixing our bicycles when we were young young and then we got motorcycles, you know little My lily on it was up in virginia beach Uh, learning english Okay, and uh Yeah, so so I was trying to learn spanish, you know, I took a couple little, you know classes on it, but uh um, so I you know We were in, we were in Columbia once, and actually doing, you know, kind of something, you know, going in, you know, and the locals sat down on a hive, an underground, you know, ground hive, and jumped up and ran and left all their guns. It's not about the lobster man, you know, take a look at it and everybody jump on board, you know, cause you know, they're, you know, it's so frustrating. Back then we didn't have the training that they got now You know, and I could have got some more of that, you know, uh, but I mean the first stitches I ever ever did other than on a You know, uh fruit Was my own knee Workup out of niland Uh, yeah, uh, you know summer hell weeks, you know, just They're warmer, um, you know, uh Sir Please don't move and they strapped me into a backboard when you know x-rayed my neck, you know, what else hurts, you know This is 10 hours after the fall Everything hurts And they x-rayed me they didn't find anything, you know, they didn't x-ray everything There was more things that hurt than than my wrist and my my ankle, Yeah, so they put us put us to bed and um Um, somebody had a watch hidden you're not allowed to have a watch you have no concept of time or day or anything Uh, and uh, you're always trying to figure out what day it is a little bit, you know, uh, you know Trying to remember what meal you count for meal to meal basically um And uh, yeah, so 22 minutes. You know, I ended up, I ended up doing a lot of briefing too, you know, it wasn't as, you know, cool as what I, you know, was expecting, but, you should have stayed in E5 is what you were thinking. I remember though my paddle is not, you know, you know making us go I'm crying hard, you know, that this paddle should make me go faster, you know, So so pull-ups was one, you know running not a great runner, you know swimming, but you know you're swimming, you know, Um and uh, which again was just crazy wrong, you know from what they get a platoon guy now had more training The regular platoon guy now has more than than what I had there so squirt away and uh, you know I never tied a knot on a human, you know a stitch and so everybody's watching You know, he gets a large degree, you know, he was, since he was, you know, that tall, you know, he was, dad, this is made in China in it.
