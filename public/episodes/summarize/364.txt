He said that they had taken out the checklist and reviewed the ejection procedures The general did not want to eject they argued about the position of the command ejection handle in the rear cockpit The major upholding his duties wanted it in the command eject position where the guy in the back ejects the front seat pilot However the general insisted that it be left in the off position thereby making each seat a single initiated ejection The major reluctantly sat up straight grabbed the yellow handle between his legs and pulled leaving the general to his fate From my vantage point the rear cockpit ejection was textbook and I remember it vividly The aft canopy opened and separated cleanly clearing the tail by at least 20 feet The rear seat started up the rails as the bottom of the seat cleared the cockpit the rocket motor ignited burn for 1.2 seconds And the seat went straight up very stable when the rocket stopped the small drogue parachute released and the seat rotated backward 90 degrees as it cleared the tail Looking over my right shoulder I could see the main C9 parachute canopy had also deployed as it started to open the seat separated from the back seat pilot and kept right on going With the canopy fully open the pilot swung back underneath I thought the whole thing was neat as hell until I looked back at the stricken aircraft What I was about to witness was chilling it would leave an indelible imprint which remains surreal and unforgettable to this day I was horrified to see the front cockpit totally engulfed in fire I saw an occasional flash from a white helmet that was barely visible through the smoke and flames The general was sitting straight up as before but motionless he seemed oblivious to his circumstances Huge flames that resembled giant blow torches streamed from the rubber petal, rudder petal area at his feet through the cockpit around him And out through the now open rear cockpit the fire had filled the phantom's interior and produced a dense black smoke trail that obscured the tail Strangely the aircraft flew on, terrified I thought the general must not be aware of the fire but however that damn truck was still sitting down there and that's when I'm going to take this to the book you say we couldn't bear to fail three passes same results and no 20 millimeter hits on the truck Chuck decided the misty fact should give it a shot someone should have reminded us that when the 20 millimeter guns are beyond 3500 foot slant range the bullets just tumble and are rendered worthless until now we had all flown above 4500 foot hard deck unwilling to deny ourselves this stupid truck that seemed to be just sitting there taunting us Chuck went in If the patchwars couldn't do it we would however we were we were the forward air controller not the fighter bomber and what we were about to do was in direct violation of standard protocol I checked the altitude indicator the three degree dive angle put us flat and right next right on top of the road The karst cliff was now a blur close and right next to me we were low enough that I could even see the pebbles on the road this was a no kidding low angle Luke gun school strafe pass Chuck had the throttle in full burner burner real steady as only Chuck can fly In the weeds now he opened fire and put a long concentrated burst of 20 millimeter cannon right on target I could not see the truck from the backseat but was certain he plastered it great we got some BDA the test was successful the champagne sweet even though the details were going to be fudged a bit fudged hell in reality this mission was a total failure what happened in the next two seconds would nullify everything we had done Chuck came off the trigger and started a hard climb as the high G came on there was a loud bang under my right seat it sounded as if Pete Rose had hit the bottom of the fuselage with a baseball bat and a home runs swing there was a whoosh as my rear view mirror was filled with fire when we pulled up I could see the fires glow on the cliff wall looking around I demanded to know who gave the order to pull out turns out it was a general in Saigon who thought it was too risky and it issued the order to withdraw I thought since that general made the decision to quit that general should be the one to tell scotch 03 that he was to be abandoned Sleep deprived and furious I ignored any sense of military rank protocol and demanded the general tell me the exact words to use when informing Jack that further rescue attempts were being aborted While we waited for the exact words I finished briefing my relief misty to one and with a heavy heart left the area knowing we were about to fail one of our own Back at home base and foo cat it was now close to sunset I sat slouched in the O Club disillusioned that my commanders would could violate our most sacred Cree if you are free and talking we never give up Alone and heartbroken my only company a couple of empty beer bottles I contemplated my commitment to these high risk missions It was then that Wells Jackson misty to one burst through the door with a big smile on his face I had to wonder what the hell he was so happy about Hey routine they got scotch out I could not believe my ears and blurted what Jackson continued yep scotch was rescued seems the general could not come up with the exact words to tell a fellow warrior he was about to be abandoned Perhaps the general began to realize how such a decision could compromise the long term morale of all of us who fought and died on the Ho Chi Minh trail That particular mission when they got him out see before that that morning There's a bridge you'd have to overfly and then there was a there was a House farmers pump house on his thing and then you turn down when and it was all proceduralized, you know brace talk trim turn Very regimented see very regimented and it was amazing I thought you know somebody that farmer goes out there and tears down that pump house none of these guys could get back That it's just a procedure and but that's that's the way it was But the thing was that I sit there and remembered as a as a little kid Sitting there in Dineuba picking grapes or something and looking up and see those contrails a single contrail So high that I could not see what was making them and I looked up at that thing and never forget I says damn So when I was waiting for to go to pilot training I was assigned to C124's cargo big old They called the big old shaky and while I was waiting to go to pilot training I was actually flying as a navigator now and this big huge cargo airplane This is in you know right in the middle of Vietnam war back and forth the Saigon and as it turned out Those hours that I spent at 8,000 feet in a C124 waiting to go to pilot training gave me some incredible Understanding that what I was going to face later on in life to fly this Voyager around the world And so we were both doing that and instead of sending him out to get fuel or leaving him there to keep the while we got the rescue going I could have went out and got fuel but all of a sudden we were really involved in keeping you know the people away from him so we could set up a rescue I realized I should have done this to start with a major amateur screw up on my part I still feel bad about it today Is that I didn't check and see how much fuel we had you know what's your fuel state and we're both ran out of fuel at the same time So both of us had to leave and go out to the tanker and when we came back there was no voice anything So but you do end up finally like you said you got a lot smarter as you as you flew around in the back of the Airplanes you got a lot smarter you got accepted for pilot training and you say this in the book before I knew it pilot training 67d was ready to begin and my time as a navigator came to an end I was off off to Laughlin Air Force Base in Del Rio, Texas right on the Rio Grande River west of San Antonio and I found out later that the guy got killed and he did get chopped up by the farmers And the guy on the top of the ridge he got captured and you know he made it through prisoner of war and I found out about it when they finally got released in 1973 I think it was So as you're doing this and again there's incredible detailed stories in the book and about these missions that you're doing I'm going to fast forward a little bit to well They'd see a little village and they'd bomb the villages and They'd say and the morning misty they come up and the controllers would say hey They had a I said the guys were up here last night and we killed 40 trucks on Brown route and We go over there and there wouldn't be any trucks on Brown route But there was a village over your burning when we put an end to all that so that I think that we directed the airstrikes against legitimate military targets on the Ho Chi men's trail and that was good and Sometimes they identified it and they wouldn't have fighters So they would identify it and then they would brief us the next morning and we'd go up there and find it Now if you're up there almost every day for six hours you get to know that place like the back of your hand And especially the gun sights The gun sights accuracy it varied dramatically In fact, there was a guy and and Laos he was on an edge of a real rugged car Anyway he had it during gunner gunnery school he had an engine failure and he ejected in gunnery school and when he got back he says well you know how did it go You know why he ejected you know what happened everybody wants to know and he got shot down and for some reason he tried to dead stick it into the Ben High River and he was killed So we lost two helicopters and we had one A1 shot down and the pilot was killed The whole morning was disjointed because they had B-52 strikes coming in and they pulled off our rescue forces numerous times and let these big bombers You know here these guys are 30,000 feet they dropped their bombs before they even go feet dry and to try to hit some targets that were near where we were working so we got pulled off back and forth Cuz just so for context for everybody that doesn't know the whole story I mean when you're working on the Voyager flight when you had this so you've been you've been scared of Heights your whole life, but you'd also been a pilot your whole life at this point You'd flown in Vietnam you'd parachute you done a bunch of things that had to do with heights But then for some reason In the middle of this effort to go and fly around the world in the Voyager aircraft You're getting another little aircraft, which by the way, I look at your your brother's little aircrafts that he built They're like little one-seaters. and he missed on So the long and short of it is the three expert patchwars for bombing accuracy you know the first guys should have taken that truck out you know they could drop it right in the guy in the truck glove box if they wanted to what the hell is going on So all of them all of them missed now right then our test was over and I should have stopped it I Kept thinking and we had some horrible times, you know challenges the five and a half years with no money having to build this big huge airplane ourselves by hand The flight test dangerous as hell, I don't know how I ever survived that thing this frail little airplane It was gonna go I think we may have gone supersonic Chuck's decision to relight the burner was a good one and it looked like we might make it to the water pilot seemed to prioritize things only after returning to Foucat that I remember hearing a loud rattlesnake sound in the headset and notice something on the glare shield our threat warning system was showing a Sam missile it was going wild surface to air missile launch flight panel was lit up like a Christmas tree we were for F4s flying straight and level to the coast a perfect target but no one in our formation gave this warning more than a passing passing glance normally we would have we would have called Sam Sam and broken for the deck afterward the patchware lead told me He told me all I had to do is when I got to pre-flight at Lackland Air Force Base and San Antonio was tell them about my civilian pilot status And they would change me right over to pilot training That was the first that was one of the first lies told to me in my new way of life away from home It all seemed so simple and I signed the dotted line This is the first time I'd ever been away from my mom my family and the safety of my sheltered life I stepped off the bus in my low-hanging Levi's and long greased up Elvis haircut. You got to keep that one quiet especially the insurance people Especially the insurance or the FAA and my medical because I knew that that was a grounding a big time grounding item for the FAA So that let's get back I want to get back to Sort of how you got into flying in the first place I'm going to go back to the book here and again look the book is awesome so many so many details inside the book Just go get the book. But in fact I got another story about another F-105 pilot that I saw being decapitated with machetes right in front of my eyes The thing about Howard it was 35 years later they found out what really happened that he was found on the ground and two stories One of them went up there and they took his dog tags one guy said he was dead he had a broken leg and he was at the foot of a tree was determined the misty's orbited just out of gun range and waited for the fighter bombers to join it took a Few minutes in the orbit to brief everyone on the target and that gave the gunners plenty of time to pump up adrenaline and exercise Their trigger fingers the misty had to mark the target with a white smoke rocket and was the first one Down the shoot the gunners knew the drill as well as the misty's rolled in Inverted and pulled the nose down toward the target every gun would open up within seconds as tracers flashed by their canopies They lined up to fire the smoke marking rocket It was always one hell of a rush a real e-ticket ride Now this was more like it. So the loss rate was high the first misty commander major bud day who we heard from already today We shot down early in the operation and spent more than six years as a POW With air refueling support from the KC 135 tankers over the Gulf of Tonkin misty missions were long four to six hours and laced with plenty of action Owing to high risks the misty unit was composed of only volunteers and each tour of duty was short only a hundred and twenty days a High percentage of those who did more than one tour were shot down Each misty sortie was assigned flights of F105 Thunder chiefs or F4 Phantom fighter bombers if they had a really hot target They could scramble gun fighters off the alert pad at the Nang to come north and work with them Most high-value targets in the north were well defended with intense triple a Once a target It's It's kind of semi foggy maybe a little drizzle kind of an eerie thing And just before dawn at Fouquette every morning alone F100 with light is after burner And off into the Merc to North Vietnam and Every morning I'd hear that that loan F100 take off and wonder You know what his day was going to be like and I always had a hard time in school But that that fascinating that the fascination for whatever the Warriors life was I don't know Had to find out for myself Now every young warrior grows up and pretty soon he's a warrior and the time goes by and he becomes the age to be a warrior Okay, I'm a young guy and I'm in the thing right now And soon as your past vertical and a nose starts down Every damn gunner knows that that they got to kill the kid they got to kill the misty because if they get marked or fucked Now there's a handful of seconds because There's a thing called lead if you're flying along we could always jank and they would have a hard time tracking us and give us the right lead to hit us And then I left with a heavy heart like we said and as it turned out Wells came up and they, the general didn't change his mind And only this time when Ingan came in and hovered they put the guy's name was the PJ had been in country three days I think He was a two striper PJ that he was going to be down on the ground and he was there this long enough to hear all the horror stories about being on the ground in North Vietnam But it was very solemn the air was generally very smooth the most serene thing you could ever see and pretty soon The coast of Vietnam which is normally kind of farmland and rice paddies and things Most peaceful thing you've ever said And as you descended out at 20,000 feet hit the coast at low altitude where our mission was You check your visor hit your visor down your chin strap on make doubly sure that all the seat ejection safety pins are pulled out and in your pocket and Then all of your emitters tied off because you don't want to have a transponder on or a beacon on Right and look right and that was the big problem That was mainly why we had a forward air control in North Vietnam because the guys the guys that would come up there They're not up there all the time and they're high altitude and a lot of times I find that this is really unfortunate that they would go and drop bombs on villages and stuff Especially at night. And he finally acquiesced and he joined MISTI and on his first check out ride he basically got killed Him and Brian Williams, Howard Williams and Brian Williams they were in an area called Chippon the very hot area up in Laos and sure enough they got hit on fire And Brian says the fire was burning from the engine compartment all the way almost all the way into the back cockpit But the one thing that I did know is that these were extremely high-risk missions in North into North Vietnam by the reconnaissance guys And they were flown by lieutenants and captains just like me The company great or the field grade and would never be a general officer So I had just come off the tanker heading into North Vietnam and I heard the call that we had taken a hit just north of a case on I think I'm going to read some highlights from it Well, but there's plenty more highlights that we're not going to read but just to kind of talk through the story a little bit You say this throughout my childhood I struggled with academics a struggle that was almost debilitating regardless of how hard I might try it seemed I was doomed for failure I was held back a year in elementary school, but nothing improved by the time I reached high school Pop decided to have a battery of test run to help me clarify my strengths and weaknesses It was determined. and I in the back and when I sat out I couldn't see out You know the windows are too high and I said there's no fine way That I'm gonna sit in this hole in this experience so I stood up and and grabbed onto the pilot seat and It was an old airplane and and I can still remember the Stuffing and I can still remember what it smelled like And he says go get a class B uniform on there's going to be a T-39 scat back to bring you down There's some generals that want to talk to you down in Saigon holy frick The last thing in the world that this little up country pog pilot wanted to do was hanging around with four star generals How many generals that you talked to at this point but no practical solution presented itself as we looked ahead at the coast coming up in the distance and watch the fuel gauge rapidly unwind it was painful obvious the gauge would read empty before we reached long before we reached the water all we could do now was reflight the relight the after burner and use the remaining fuel for speed before it completely gushed out hoping we could still make it to the safety of the gulf of Tonkin the guys on our wing looked closely to see if the fuel was running inside the fuselage where it might blow us out of the sky upon relighting the after burner they let us know it didn't look like it This should have been a standard ejection they were flying at 10,000 feet straight level at an ideal speed of about 230 knots everything was set for routine ejection and water rescue Which is interesting that you're talking about a routine ejection and water rescue that shows your mentality I had never seen an ejection up close the notoriously complicated F4 Martin Baker seat known as the back breaker would be something to witness I eased the old hun to route formation about 30 feet out on his left wing and waited for what seemed an eternity nothing happened Almost two minutes dragged by before the rear seat finally ejected later on I asked the back seat of what had taken so long they knew they were on fire Well, see I wanted to go to the Air Force pilot training I can go back to that day that I stood there and it at March Air Force Base looking up at that fighter pilot You know, he was a god from a different place and here after all those The interim years I was going to be able to do that now. And the more that I'd look down the more The more this phobia would just explode into my psychic heart rate breath skin cold and clammy and uncontrolled shaking and The first thing you do with this you get all the symptoms going and then you identify One part of your body and you concentrate on it totally on that particular thing and I chose my right elbow Because it was shaking and I concentrate as much as I can and I finally after maybe no kidding after 20 minutes I could get that one elbow to stop to stop shaking
