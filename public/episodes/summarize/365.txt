We're gonna do it again and I'm like 40 years from now like If I think about how old I'm gonna be and how much is gonna happen in that 40 years or 30 40 years I think it's really hard to not at least envision It's it's gonna be dramatic how much different the world is and just the concept of even what AI means It's not like it's going through something where it can like cook food for you or draw a piece of art It's like doing level eye level thing that is well beyond anything you can comprehend and just visualizing It'd be like saying the to the right brothers. so I'm gonna have to come back to it like that comments I would say a timeless comment Your achievement as a leader is based on what your people accomplish If you've listened to what I said five minutes ago and like oh, I'm just gonna outsource my leadership to a computer down the road That's not a good plan the attributes that the the behaviors of good leadership Regardless of what computers might be able to do in the future The most important thing you could ever possibly do is make you and the people around you better leaders So don't get all wrapped up on this AI is gonna solve your problems I don't know when it will if it ever will but between now and then learning how to be a good leader is a really good use of your time I I'm picturing trying to convince other people that that you need to be on board with when you've come up with a plan Knowing that they're gonna have to be on board with that plan and when when he says you're gonna beat your head against the wall I think like you said your point is just the amount of sheer work that it takes You don't just like hey you guys and they're like cool and I I 100% agree with you like I have seen enough things happen in my life around people that those are character changing events like like you've described I'm just thinking of the other side of it too trying to Like a contemplate what he's saying is and we've talked about this when someone reveals that a character to you Believe them that component of like hey if jaco if I catch and go And it's like a little if you don't understand what the context of that There's a little bit of risk in there because that can be like hey listen I'm sorry, Jocko, but this is how I want to get this thing done and I'm gonna defend That conviction and I just can't help but think about Like this the example you and I that you were talking about about you and me and Something we have to think about echelon for all the time is a lot of times when people hear these military examples We're talking about the conflict. We're I'm not gonna be like that sounds like a good idea Because we're not aligned Now but defending ideas which is like ideas like I said earlier ideas can be pretty much worthless, right? So just even being cautious with the idea of defending those convictions if it's someone on my team and they have an idea The chances are especially if it's like most companies most people aren't dumb most people are pretty smart They got an idea they thought about it If I can find any reason to abandon my position and go your position I'm gonna do that unless once like you said once in a blue moon like dude Your idea is terrible and we just kind of talk through it. I'm gonna build a palace or we're gonna build a lean to which one I'm gonna do I'm gonna build a palace or I'm gonna struggle to build a lean to That's the question All right, then he goes on to say um all leaders Must possess these qualities which I've been discussing and the great leaders are those who possess one or more of them to an outstanding degree Some leaders just miss being great because they are weak in one or more of these areas There is still another ingredient in this formula for a great leader that I have left out and that is luck He must have opportunity then of course when opportunity knocks he must be able to rise and open the door Some may ask why do you talk about the qualities of leadership? That's where dreams die and that's why a Leader's a leader's job is to make that execution happen and here's the thing There's another thing said Cess don't we got interviewed about the battle of Ramadi and and Seth told the interviewer that I had to like beat I had to beat my head against the wall for every operation that we were able to do which was an exaggeration But the fact the matter is and I would tell that story to the young officers like if you think you're gonna do a mission without Like making that mission happen. It's like 45 is like right after the war like the war was just barely over So Pat wasn't alive and and so he's a consultant on the movie patent and of course in the movie It shows them as kind of like Friends, you know close friends little different personalities So I think if you think about that like what's gonna happen in 30 40 years I think that curve is so freaking steep that it's hard not to visualize It's gonna be something way beyond all we can imagine and the idea of like me Dave Burke you needing me to do that is It's a little arrogant. There's bots on Twitter today We're probably less today, but there's there's bots and stuff out there that are having conversations with people and people can't tell Yeah, they can't tell yes true, but once they knew it was a bot if you tell them it's a bot brother It's gonna change right they're not gonna be oh equally as in lover only thing you got to get over is like the little hump of You just tell people Do you want to help me execute this thing and there's all kinds of different people out there and Some people idea people and some people are execution people and you got to work with these other people to get things to move very few people Are gonna come up with an idea Execute the idea properly with the right logistics to make this thing work. It's called jocofuel.com Which is one that you know what I just kind of grabbed Right as the whole idea came to fruition You want to hear something really you might already know this but try go on go daddy or wherever and go look for urls containing jocos something like something real like I don't know jocomicrophones or a jocobottle or I don't know something You'll find that a lot of them are taken.
