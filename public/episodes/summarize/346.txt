There's like I don't know is there anything equivalent for a fighter pilot to being a world war two fighter pilot Look the guys in vietnam, obviously they extremely challenging Uh, you know, uh horrible situations to go and go and into you know having Guys like charlie plum and william reeter on on the podcast to talk about their experiences you know Surface to air missiles migs out there Uh, those encounters were relatively rare Compared to you're going to bomb germany. so I could only play on the sea and the meetings I Could never go to the varsity But it sounds like you know in the book you talk about sounds like your dad not only encourage you with flying but he put a lot of He put a lot of It seemed like he put a lot of trust in you even as a young kid a lot of responsibility I know you and you know, I get asked a lot of questions about parenting and at one point you crashed your car How that happened oh Young and Young and scared hit the wrong pedal. I don't know why I like the end so much when he was like Oh, I don't even know if that was my shot It might have been the other guy shot, you know, and I don't even know how to approach this guy So even when he's talking about He you're right here Sir, even when you're when you're talking about looking down your wing lines seeing his nose come up to you and you know If he's got two or three more degrees on you, which is which is kind of like a matter of inches really in an airplane that he's gonna get That this measurements gonna get a shot And the the sinking feeling that comes with seconds later the elation of watching him shudder and you know that he can't keep his turn even the angles and the fault When you guys were getting that thing it must have seemed like you know a lot of times for me, you know, I grew up I grew up the The p-51 was like an antique right it was like an antique thing And you got some other Um Some other things that you talk about Just about being a good fighter pilot Uh, you because you're you know, you're mentioning that you got to control your emotions You also say a fighter pilot mentality was taking firm route now living close to the edge Sort of went with the job Daring audacity creativity flare These things were as much a part of being a Good fighter pilots makeup as skill and sound judgment and were encouraged within certain parameters And then his airplane abruptly pitched up and over and smashed upside down onto the wing of the b29 I saw the explosive bolts of fire if a certain angle between the wings works was exceeded They were to fire automatically blowing the connection apart, but it didn't matter It all happened too fast the spasm reaction of an autopilot far out of phase through the f84 Over onto the bomber like the cover of a book slammed shut There was no time for anything not even a call on the radio The outer panel of the bomber's left wing peeled upward From the wingtip almost to the outboard engine and then the f f84 fell against the main spar the impact sheared the jets nose away Cleanly just in front of the cockpit the fighter bounced off and fell away in a glide I remember yelling for john to get out, but I got no response The bomber nosed over and with the most With most of the wing gone fell into big power spiral and augered almost straight in It wouldn't have been the simplest thing in the world to get out of pointed almost straight down inspiring And spiraling tightly and pressurized which would have made getting a door open even more difficult Earlier flights had been flown without pressurizing the cabin guarding against exactly this sort of incident We were we were assigned to the ninth for a short time and uh When we got our airplanes well then tactics The 8th air force was in charge and the 8th fighter command Told us how to escort They said we want to see you we want you close Uh when the enemy comes in we want just to drive it away and When just drive them away and then come back You know is this this being videoed? They like the regular one like the best They think that's like a treat and I kind of psychologically like train them to know that that's like the treat or whatever And so he had to been alive So there was some hope, you know, you know, drag along and on and on and then you find out he's killed it's uh Maybe a easy way to break him on it, but it's still a blow no matter how you slice it Meanwhile you guys get issued the first P-51s that are going to enter the war And Tell me about that p-51 the first time you got to fire that thing up I felt I felt like I learned it real quick Uh, especially in altitude I learned later that um A measure smith in the hands of a good pilot down low Could give a Mustang a hard time Mm-hmm, but I never experienced that Fortunately, I guess I'd like to say a little bit about the Pacific of the European theater The airplanes in the in the European war We're all very close in performance 109 190 Uh, not the the twin engine ones. So jockel fuel.com get yourself some milk Get yourself some joint warfare some krill super krill uh origin usa's look made in america is a thing and peep like you know like bud anderson said people like Oh, we can't make the stuff over here. And I don't what I mean in trim keep the ball centered If you had a ball off Then you're you know, you're shooting And the airplanes over here You can't you gotta you can't Oh, so this makes whereas normally you could get away with having trim be off a little bit because you're still just maintaining some kind of a bearing But in this situation if your trim is off a little bit your guns pointed in the wrong direction might might be you know I got to go get confirmation from a Guy that's obviously saw what was going on So now I'm riding uh Going in the jeep or to the officer's club and can you tell who the other pilot is or you just know what squadron he is No, I know who he was. and then you look up the the silhouette Look the cool thing that's cool Like it would be a little bit difficult to tell a corsair from the side profile, you know when it's out at a little distance, you know I'm I'm one of these lucky guys About this time a group commander came by and says hey, but we're gonna Uh They call me Andy actually You're gonna go to the Royal Air Force central flight instructor school gunnery instructor And uh Take a p-51 and fly the course with a p-51 instead of a spitfire Which is what the course was taught in So that gave me 35 hours in the Mustang before combat Where other guys were lucky to get Uh two or three flights At that time when I went in if you Knew what you wanted to do And I could convince your instructor That you'd be a good fighter pilot Your chances were pretty good of getting what you wanted We needed they were trying to build up From You know a few few Hundreds of pilots To 225,000 pilots And don't let safety get in the way of progress progress I learned later the 104s nose pitched up Which was always a danger in the starfighter when you ran out of speed and reached a certain critical angle A device made the stick actually shaking your hand to warn you as you approached this angle of attack And if you didn't correct then a stick pusher would move the nose down automatically Instead of stalling at this angle the 104 would pitch up Gyrate around and fall into a spin you could recover from if you had enough altitude Only this time the air was too thin for maneuvering and the small thrusters didn't have enough power to force the nose down Chuck's plane fell into what became a flat spin Bellied down like a frisbee the kind of spin you can almost forget getting out of He tried everything to book in the book to recover He even popped the landing drag shoot trying to get the nose down with no luck I followed him down from 25,000 feet circling his spinning aircraft as we reached 10,000 I was yelling for him to get out That's right I'm going to go to a little combat here Flying skill I've always felt meant more in Europe than it did in other theaters where the airplanes had different differing strong points the p38 was successful in the pacific Although it couldn't turn with the zero because it was much faster when diving Its pilot could attack from above and then keep going and the zero had no chance of catching it Same with the p40 earlier on The fog wolves and measurements had more speed The pacific tactics wouldn't work on these aircraft and the p38s was much less effective against them To beat them you had to turn with them like i'm turning with this 109 Right now northwest of Hanover. But I have no memory of what the letter contained exactly And and elinor was was jack's wife Like most men who've known combat I can remember the finest detail the nuances what airplanes look like in my gun sights what I felt in the swirl of battle What I said to people and what they said to me on certain days 40 odd years ago I can remember silly things the words to some glenn miller tunes the first points I ever scored in a basketball game These things are burned into me.
