So that's what we end up doing a lot we end up doing a lot of lying to ourselves about the game that we're playing about the game that we want to play about the game that we should play and we don't tell ourselves the truth about it This is also why it's very important to be able to take a step back and detach because your little conniving mind will outsmart you It will outsmart you and it'll agree with the fact that you really don't care about you know having a good relationship with this girl or this guy or it'll say you know what I don't really care about getting advanced at work because I'm good with where I'm at Your mind will tell you that and you gotta watch out because your mind is smart it knows how to manipulate you, knows what to say so pay attention to the game that you're playing select the right game and make sure that you don't lie to yourself So the lying to yourself like that goes super deep like lying to yourself about like Did I hit a nerve over there? It's like whatever No, it was it was well into the club where I was like, hey, I got to do something like creative You know with with people that I like that are like that has a real future Not just the manager of a nightclub, you know, like that's not a I didn't see that as Who I was kind of a thing So like you know when someone's like in the same lane as you that's when you're going to be paying attention you know where certain people even if someone's like just playing a whole different game like someone who's like won the Nobel Prize There are other people in their in their little environment and their ecosystem I was playing that game I was in that game You're trying to get you know get the right job working the right place You know I want to be a seal People are into chess People are into women like you name it and there's someone that's gonna make that a huge part of the game that they're playing Can do this with anything actually you know in the book final spin sure the that's sort of the character of arty the cleaner who's totally into washing machines and dryers and Folding laundry and stuff like that so he's he got to be he has to be a good football player like quarterback so there's something in his mind and you can train all this stuff like in and of course physically like he's a tall guy you know that helps and you got physical attributes for sure but just because you don't have a vertical like that's more like basketball your vertical I feel like you're you know in your position and a lot of people in the position where You have you had such a like action path for like a better term Yep, like young Life, you know that it's hard to be like man. They're so different I mean unless you're playing songs for them at the one the weekends or whatever, but You they don't like which I don't They don't play off each other as much, you know, but the the Venn diagram overlap Of jujitsu of SEAL teams of leadership And you know like either then you got like the real estate thing and that was always just a matter of me was like There's a game going on here. That's where you begun your journey into too hard in the paint The status and ego recognition and stuff then again, I don't know I could be wrong I can't read Maslow's mind, but this is what it seems like It's like an inner need now if you need this above and beyond normal stuff then it starts to mutate right like just like how you say like a healthy There's a healthy idea of it. Like we're talking about one training session makes you feel a little bit but imagine you look up and you know that someone else who's pretty much the same level human as you Like look I look at some people like Dan that person's doing I don't have the capability of doing what they're doing in that arena like whatever that arena is Freakin Tom Brady right? Is that ever like a motive not a motivator, but like a um Like a tool you use to be like hey, I should do more or whatever by thinking like oh, I don't want to be old and Regret not doing certain things. It was actually after I got injured I had to work my way back into the depth chart Is like I don't like football enough to like have to play this game as hard as everyone I'm looking around and guys are like they're down for the grind of football and that's football and they're watching the games on the weekends Yeah, like where you look at air airborne airborne and you think there you think at least there's a decent chance This guy's and he's gonna be paralyzed Yeah, I'll literally paralyzed from the neck down because he gets smashed on his head and he hits the ground He looks like it looks like I just walked up to you and like said hi. and I'm like ah it's like it's almost like a justification You know I'm like ah he didn't call me but whatever you know kind of thing Yeah that's a that's a like a site it can be like a psychedelic experience like you know when you get to like the I thought you were gonna say psychotraumatic experience. No you're giving me a little bit too much like niceness I'm really like doing a 20 rep squat I don't even care about being this is stupid That weak part of my brain gets aggressive like dude this is you're gonna get hurt and you're not gonna be able to roll you're not gonna be able to surf How big do you want it how strong do you need to be bro?
