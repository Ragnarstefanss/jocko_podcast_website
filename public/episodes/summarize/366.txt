And as they got this guy he said they were leaving the ship and they looked like Wherever on the ship and stoner was there like doing the duty that they all had to do like they had to clean something to do Someone and he was up there just like doing it by himself and I was like, I can dig the dude was so freaking And like pumped, you know, um, that's taking care of your people Uh, never criticize. like oh when when when criminal broke walks on the reburr stand at attention Look, oh Roger that, you know like I know what you're saying, but Yeah, that followership in there is like this blind obedience is not what you want from your people when the skipper would when we be getting Ready to do like a seal team one when I got to seal team one and the skipper would come and talk to everyone Like we'd all be in the classroom But unless you've been in a situation like convent like oh crap The only way the the only way we will be successful is if we have real decentralized command mission type orders Chaka goes and makes things happen because all he knows is the outcome and I can't help him with anything else because he's off doing his thing You don't understand how not just how important is but how it actually works and there's just these little There's just like little little pieces of like garrison leadership inside that even it's like You can't get that Now if you go to a real restaurant like a big restaurant A bunch of different people and they're like those waiters are going to have to make some decisions That cooks are going to be like, all right, we're going to get this done Hey run over to run over to Vaughn's and grab some extra milk because like that stuff's got to happen people got to make decisions So in the garrison environment, you can micromanage things But as soon as you get into a dynamic environment as soon as you get into a combat environment You have to use decentralized command 100% and in any organization that's that's Going to progress you have to use decentralized command. Yeah, I'm like, are you like in your mind saying But in case he does we'll go with it kind of a thing or because there's a difference between that and then really leaning on someone For the plan like, you know, if it's clear that Dave knows more than You or me or whatever about something you're like, hey, we better go to Dave for this plan You know, that's like leaning on him for it we're gonna and you know what we're all gonna look so sharp that The boss is gonna know that we're the platoon that can get that's such a great example Because those are the it's like boss wants the paperwork done 12 hours ahead of the due date You know like oh come on like guys listen That's the those are the scenarios where your uniform you don't want to wear getting paperwork done Those are the far more realistic scenarios you had to come down and go. I'm guessing obviously uh, I think jim web James Webb's son, you know, he writes articles and he sent me an article that they've made some like significant changes in Marine Corps infantry training and They sounded outstanding and what it sounded like was it has shifted towards like what I when I ran training What we did which was like really decentralized like it was going to be mayhem It was going to be chaos and they're now hitting these Marines with those type of scenarios So that they're even more prepared. And it says that the two styles of leadership mentioned above are the extremes Each style has its bad and good points What are the good points of the first one like letting everyone know i'm in charge Making people in a team but not being a part of it telling supporters what to do and how to do it and making decisions without ever There's like Dang man, and how about like oh hey by the way you're jaco, you're free to pick what everyone you want to go However, you want to do this is up to like not one as good and one as bad. You know what that is Like the dress blues for for a navy enlisted guy below the let rank of e Six e six and below like you you look like a cracker jack box, you know, you look like a like a stereotypical sailor Ask some questions Ask some questions bearing bearing is a marine's general appearance carriage Deportment and conduct by your bearing you establish a standard for your periods of periods and subordinates Your appearance should show confidence competence alertness and energy your clothing equipment should be neat and clean at all times Your voice and action should be under control Few things can steady the morale of troops like a leader who with full knowledge of the difficulties of the situation Neither looks or acts worried when speaking to marines talking short plain sentences Never talk down marines or allow sarcasm to enter the conversation vulgar speech frequent loss of temper Like it says frequent loss of temper like occasionally go for it And an irritable nature show lack of self-confidence that subordinates easily see they react to the lack of self-confidence with resentment or even in Subordination avoid criticizing the entire group of marines for the failings of a few Those who didn't want those who didn't do anything wrong will resent it Your bearing should show dignity and control of both your emotions and your actions dignity shows pride and confidence in yourself and the ability of your marines emotional control shows that you have Any situation well in hand to develop and improve your bearing you should do the following Practice control of your voice facial expressions and gestures Demonstrate calmness sincerity and understanding master your emotions so that you can control them and they do not control you Speak simply and directly Like you said, it's like not like somebody wrote this with bad intentions, but um This is what this is what we're drawn to and the and the authoritarian mind is drawn to this even more and The orderly mind is drawn to this even more and the highly disciplined which as you know, obviously discipline is like my favorite Characteristic and if you have too much discipline, you're gonna fall apart in combat because this is not a disciplined environment combat I was thinking this I started thinking about this I'm like Is was this thing like the navy achievement medal of some like some like lieutenant colonel or major that was like We had like a rough grid of where the target might be Update us as we move Well, we had I mean, I think the term qrf is somewhat universal like the quicker reaction force We had a stand a standing qrf all the time which had a very short After five minutes we had some number like it was five minutes It was some at some period of time from the time that got triggered to launch the qrf was a very very short period of time minutes whatever it was The most likelihood of direct action Happened on those like if you will launch on a qrf you are going to get into some fight somehow So something somebody isn't getting the way so you can go up through the chain and I can actually skip my boss I'm it's rudimentary in this example, but I can skip my boss and go to the the big boss if I need to request mass and like he was Describing it can almost be like a you's like A threat or like I'm gonna request massed. Yeah, and maybe the thing about this and dude, we always talk about this We always try to picture the room of the people that are like in here writing this and who these people are I wonder if they like it's almost like you fall into the trap of like, oh these young Marines They need to be they need to have it explain to them so this stuff There's there's probably you just like just like shooting like there's a chance You know I would take Dave and get you dialed in at 300 yards on your rifle You're gonna do pretty good if I take a group of a hundred people and do that How many have some people that cannot that aren't gonna be hitting paper? That's what it seems like to me You can almost pitch like hey go back and come up with um, you know, like the best example you can Yeah, and they're like, okay.
