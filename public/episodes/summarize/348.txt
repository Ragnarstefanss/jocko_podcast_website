yeah I can tell you that right now because he's tapped me out one million times and I and I've seen it we used to do you know dojo storms and all that stuff and even just tournaments he would just foot lock leg lock everybody um and win by other methods because his whole game of jiu-jitsu but it's kind of wild you know like Donner was asking him like you know or said something like you know you spend a lot of time on the you know going for people's legs and and Dean Lister said why would you ignore 50% of the human body and that's become this thing i mean they're significant but this is usually just one or two bad elements of them and in fact you get bad guys who some some movies they do on purpose and they do it well where if they want you to really not like a bad guy like they'll make him like kind of weasley or someone who like you wouldn't want to like listen to her hang out with in fact you'd really rather be quiet and not show up to the party kind of a thing but usually the good bad guys you're like oh as long as he liked me i would like to hang out with that guy or be like that guy when you think about it so you get a conor mcgregor as the bad guy and you know how like you know kind when you get you know when you get hungry and then like even like a normal chocolate bar or something seems like oh like wait you know just when you get real hungry bro fully you ever and this is not a judgmental thing by any means but you ever um you ever think about yourself before you knew jiu-jitsu and been like man i felt like that was almost like an empty shell version of myself you ever think that you feel like you were not enlightened yes you feel like there was just a whole thing it was all a lot a lot of it too was like a lie but what's there's another word what is the word like the buddhist used to say is an illusion you were in i was a little bit of an illusion because there's a lot of things that you think that are wrong I mean I that's what I told Jose Padilla the director I was like go get some private equity people I mean this isn't that tough a business case to make yeah come on and that's not it's not like a crazy special effects movie or anything either like it's not going to be a huge budget film it's big like you know you got some great fights you know you have like Helio fighting Camara no Camara so that's literally my buddy had to free went to his house you know like the big industrial toilet paper rolls that are like a foot across that's what they had in the seal teams and this dude had it at his house outside pro you're a savage wasn't even a papers on toilet paper taking a freaking roll of that roll probably lasts like six months here's the thing well here's the thing and actually which is part of the fraud wastes and abuse by the way fraud wastes and abuse is though those things in life cost money and if you don't have a lot of money like certain parts little little tiny parts of life that all are and there's a lot of them too a lot of them every day all day those little parts of life are hard it's like they're so hard that you're taking toilet paper from the but oh i kind of want to be like him and that always has to have a positive element to it like darth vader um like they're they're usually like guys who are like sure they're all you know you just gave you just gave me a list of one you started counting your fingers too like you're gonna have at least five give me a list of one you know you you've heard the story that like you know Dean Lister is obviously and he he had that conversation with Dean and it's kind of like this mythical thing now right it's a little bit of a mythical thing that Dean said you know Dean was get catching guys and Dean tells it's super humble but you know what I at the time and you've heard me say this like I was a richest guy in the world me and my friends in the games we thought we were the richest guys in the world we had so much money young single team guy dude e5 frog man gets on in your position too you get a lot of stuff paid for right by the you know like well wet suits so if you have money I'll just pay for it just whatever whatever whatever kind of a thing where it's like things will come a lot easier and I thought about this too where you know how like when you think back to the times when you don't make any money it's like what what was the difference because 20 years I was in the Navy but think about it there are certain parts of life it's funny I say that I said, let's, I know the US attorney and like, let's do it, you know, if you, you got to think this through, if you want to, you know, go really do this, you go to the US attorney, you don't go or would the DA in town, you don't go to some academic bureaucrat that will pollute the case. hey oh hold on you know that kind of hurt that kind of thing and like the other day we actually like he i had forgotten he'd hurt in his hand because he's been hit he's at all taped up you know Yeah, they want people, you know, most of the elites were, you know, real, you know, peasants with, you know, no education, nothing. places to stay like these are pretty like per diem if you have if you have money or you get that stuff free it's kind of like it makes it things so much easier but it keeps you in a little bit more of a box than if you didn't so let's say this i'm a jujitsu bomb surf bomb whatever i don't have like i don't tell weed i don't rob banks i have normal So, you know, for leadership, for me, you know, the reason I know this is because I teach leadership, and we teach leadership to people that have gone through big programs, and they don't, they'll tell us like, oh, I learned more in the three days I just spent with your company about leadership, infinitely more. And you know, that some of them have been, you know, real heavy lifters when it comes to drugs, you know, like, they should take them to the Mayo Clinic and test them because from crack to fentanyl to and lost a lot of friends to fentanyl lost a lot of friends to opiates in the last few years. right they love him he's not just a pure heal you know what they term heal is right from wrestling like like chael sonan was duty he was you know bad guy ink bro like right you kind of like dude some of the trail sonan uh like smack talking i don't know it entered the algorithm it entered my algorithm oh you know how he knew all these people you're like Eric Paul's in you know like all these people And, and as I said in the book, like, they were minor compared to like guys like you, then there was like prison extraction unit guards that were so big. And I see a lot of programs that are set up like that, where they're teaching you a lot about the guitar, and you learn some theory about the guitar, and you know what a guitar looks like, but you don't know how to play that guitar. it's almost like within a certain certain threshold it's like you that's the best thing you can actually do for yourself within reasons so sure if you would look at and be like hey this is dumb this is a dumb move you know but there's also a lot about life and a lot about people dealing with problems and you know similar to the things you talk about and how the answer can't be found in a pill or a shrink and that you know you you kind of have to you you know there's sections on strategy there's sections on things Hicks and talks about generally i i mentioned my book final spin publishers weekly gave me a good review thank you publishers weekly hey publishers weekly you didn't like breathe that's a bummer it's a good book check it out i've written a bunch of other books about leadership i've written a bunch of kids books get the kids book for kids you know it's gonna help them it's gonna make the world a better place ashlomfront we solve problems through leadership if you want to check out or if you need help with leadership at your organization go to ashlomfront.com come to one of our events next one is at lana we have the muster everything we do sells out that's going to sell out too but i don't know i didn't i didn't use dalton that's what i think no i don't know i didn't look at that bro a bunch of people just been sending it to me and then people have been bringing it up to there's a lot of roles that connor McGregor would be awesome at dalton's not one of them in my opinion i don't know you think but i never knew this as a specific thing so the best bad guys in history are guys that we like like guys who are we're like hey sure he's a bad guy and it's it's just it makes the dod seem positively efficient same thing is going on though too with like Hollywood because if you want to you could make a movie and you can post it on youtube and see what happens well and the thing is like the Hixon movie is remarkable because it starts with Maeda so it starts in 1890 in Japan and Maeda is an unbelievable guy I mean he's prize fighting all over Europe he comes to the United States like in the 20s he's prize fighting in the south and then you know like all your knowledge and stuff like that it's like from hixon And that wasn't even the bad teams like Pico Rivera, with these like these Mexican teams running the wishbone, you know, just like, what is this? you know you know how like you get like a And they just, you know, got it got their boats, took them in, took them to Toul Slang prison, interrogated and tortured them for, you know, gosh, the last two who died, you know, there was days before the Vietnamese liberated Cambodia. and I think what's motivated me on this case is is how heavily that's weighed on those Marines and those who knew that and were ordered not to talk about it as well and so um I spoke at their reunion this last May and um you know this is something that you know many of these guys have been back to Cambodia they've met with M. Somme they've pleaded with him where are their bodies and you know So, and we had to do a lot of standup back then and Luis LeMau would put on these, these ridiculous leather boxing gloves and, and I do my Bruce Lee stuff and they all like Hicks and kids thought it was the best, you know, and, and, and it was a great time, you know, and, and Hicks and I became good friends. and I'm gonna meet this guy now I know this guy you know it's kind of crazy how many like that for one level of connection to John Donahur and then John Donahur to Dean Lister And so, you know, so I, you know, again, and I would throw this stuff at Hicks and come on, Hicks and like, yeah, and you know you know surfing yeah drugs and beating you know beating up street fights where is it that's probably the most everything you've done that might have been the closest to death you've been and then back to your weed uh selling days you said you didn't like to do the small stuff no only do like bigger like what how does that work where would you get it from or whatever from the older guys who were smuggling it
