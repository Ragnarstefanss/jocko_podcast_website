Taking it back to the book German officers are expected to give attention to the mental outlook of their men and this includes giving them frequent talks on the war the soldier must know what the war is that the war is his personal affair and he must be instructed on its causes meaning and progress it is believed that the soldiers who are informed as to why they are fighting and of their part in the battle will show improved discipline in combat you've got to explain the why newspapers radio and books are used to assist toward this end an article in a military review advises the company commander to assemble his unit once a week for discussion the father of the company should speak on all matters official and unofficial current events politics which influence the mental attitudes and morale of the men troop leadership reminds officers that quote the leaders must live with their troops participating in their dangers their wants their joys their sorrows only in this way can they estimate the battle worth and the requirement of the requirements of the troops man is not responsible for himself alone but for his comrades he can do more who has greater capacity of accomplishment must instruct the inexperienced and weaker from such conduct the feeling of real comradeship develops which is just as important between the leaders and the men as between the men themselves troops welded together only superficially and not through long training and experience more easily fail under severe strain and under unexpected crisis therefore before the outbreak of war the development and maintenance of steadfastness and discipline in the troops as well as their training is of decisive importance so look that's from their book the exact same stuff that you'll hear in the US military the precepts outlined above have been actually carried out as us or observers have reported during the past few years one report states German leadership is based on mutual respect between officer and man we were again impressed with the fact that cooperation between officers and men works both ways we're going to get into principles of leadership section six the training of German officers of all grades for the present war has been so conducted to emphasize certain basic doctrines while these may seem rather general and character they must be understood in order to appreciate German tactics according to observers German combat tactics reflect the application of these doctrines which are by no means pious phrases of military theorists the very concrete and practical manual on troop leadership is full of references to these principles as later quotations will show the German army has been organized and trained to operate as the task force principle according to the definition of task force is a unit of arms of all arms and services under one commander for the accomplishment of a single specified mission this principle operates at all levels of command when a mission is assigned to a commander he is given the means judge necessary to accomplishment to accomplish it this these means are turned over to him for combined training by which his men are molded into a combat team the members of this team must know their mission and work together for its accomplishment individual units are called upon to merge into the structure of the command team of the combat team the training phase permits commanders and staff to become thoroughly acquainted with all their officers in this way they learn one another shortcomings and strong points so that many later misunderstandings are prevented in the stress of combat personal combinations thus built up often become so strong that they are maintained through successive campaigns every effort is made to discourage rivalry between components of a team for example through march song though march songs are highly regarded and developed there are no songs about the superiority of infantry to engineers or artillery etc there are no inter company or inter battery athletics to develop useless competitive emotions commanders of subordinate units are so imbued with the feeling of cooperation that they go out of their way to assist one another they cover and move for each other considerable attention is given to the acquaintance of officers of one branch with the weapons and tactics of another even the manual of a specialized branch shows this effort anti-aircraft gunners manual has a section on what these gunners must know about their employment as part of ground forces teams including a discussion of divisional tactics the greatest factor in successful deployment of armed troops is speed in obtaining the initial coordination of arms and in the execution of a coordinated mission by various arms so they are absolutely pushing for everyone to work together that's what they're pushing for we have to cover and move for each other their next principle is aggressiveness and a niche initiative some people say default aggressive I've heard the prime characteristic of German tactical doctrine is maintenance of the initiative and avoidance of stabilization the Germans believe absolutely that if a trained commander prepares and executes aggressive moves even with even average ability and reasonable speed the enemy will be kept too busy meeting them to carry out a successful offensive measures the German officer phrase the concept in a way that can be understood by troops our men are taught that their own safety depends upon their getting to the enemy's rear and not staying in front of him this is fundamental of our training these guys are looking to flank all day long aggressive tactics require the use of initiative by combat leaders down to the platoon commanders and non-commissioned officers development of this capacity for taking the initiative is stressed at all points in military training whether theoretical or practical no illusion surviving the first world war is more dangerous than the notion that German leaders especially of small units are bound by rigid and mechanical regulations and can move only in accordance with detailed pre-arranged plans so again that's what they started this war of this 1942 by the end Hitler was dictating they lost this in actual fact German leaders of small units have shown great skill in this war adapting their tactics and flecks flexibility to meet new situations they have been trained to do this the handbook on the German squad and combat illustrates the doc the this doctrine quote in the execution of battle missions one should be most careful to avoid the idea that only one solution can be right can be the right one only success in an actual case could prove that a given solution was the right one a model solution must not be drilled into the soldiers they and particularly the squad leader should be trained to be flexible and should learn to be equal on any occasion so this is kind of the antithesis of what you think of a Nazi right just calling out for flexibility and for free thought I mean free thought is the antithesis of Nazi attitude Nazi attitudes we're all gonna think the same thing that's why we're gonna start indoctrinating you when you're 10 years old but like why is that in here this is what this this is what a Nazi book said yeah right self-control and sexual matters because there's some deviant freaks going on and he's trying to tighten it up never know I guess but cleanliness and speech a balanced character goes on to say the German military Bible for company officers is the manual of troop leadership this book gives their basic tactical and combat doctrine and it's plenty say on the moral aspects of leadership the following are some quotations here's some quotations from their books war is the severest test of the spiritual and physical strength in war character outweighs intellect many stand forth on the field of battle who in peace would remain unnoticed this is hype trade shit right here for the troops the officer is a leader and a teacher besides his knowledge of men and his sense of justice he must be distinguished by his superior knowledge and experience his earnestness his self-control and his courage again hype the example and personal conduct of officers and non-commissioned officers are of decisive influence on the troops the officer who in the face of the enemy is cold-blooded decisive and courageous inspires his troops onward the officer must likewise find the way into the hearts of his subordinates and gain their trust to an understanding of their feelings and thoughts and through never ceasing care of their needs mutual trust is the surest basis of discipline and necessity and danger so there you go there's a little dichotomy coming at you gotta be the hardest dude but at the same time you gotta care about your troops through never ceasing care of their needs the Nazi dichotomy of leadership there relations of company officers with enlisted personnel German Directive stressed the desirability of comradeship in units as a moral basis for fighting efficiency and again the company officers are reminded of their responsibility the company commander does the book again the company commander says when the soldier learns by experience that he is being taken care of and that is the officer as his best comrade who sees to this care then he is ready he will follow such a superior through thick and thin and will cheerfully perform the most difficult duties hey Hitler you might have wanted to read that paragraph when you left your boys at Stalingrad to get surrounded and freaking die the officer must always set an example by his own conduct and soldierly qualities he must never think of himself until his men have been cared for I mean this is like leadership one on one right never think of yourself until your team is taken care of only such an example can convince of the moral right to demand services from others only the model life can confirm that right the officers own efficiency alone will emphasize the necessity of his orders again you get that weird use the word efficiency the scary word I don't like it when Nazis say efficiency it makes me nervous if the men copy the example set by the officers officers and men will be joined comradely association and festivities place the officer in a situation basically different from that in times of peace he must never represent a contrast to the privations and restrictions which the men necessarily take upon themselves and he must never forget that their need for association and festivity is no less great or justified than his that than his own so that's what that's saying right there is that when you're an officer and your team has to sleep in the field or they have to go without food or they have to go without water you need to do the same thing burdens and privations restrictions and negations are shared mutually and equally every company commander must be a Spartan his must men must feel that privations mean nothing to him that he rises above such problems and that daily difficulties cannot break his spirit again solid advice continuing on the company officers advised to be severe when necessary but without resorting to abuse to disciplinary punishment as rare to use disciplinary punishment as rarely as possible and always in a way that is clearly justified to take an interest in the personal difficulties of his men to maintain a cheerful atmosphere under all circumstances to visit a and converse with troops in quarters and to take the greatest care in choice of supervision of non-commissioned officers this does not seem like Nazi stuff. and then eventually you're using like wild terrain features next section is called surprise during the training phase the importance of the principle of surprise in combat is constantly featured according to German doctrine surprise depends on the use of secrecy deception and speed secrecy this depends on maintaining the strictest discipline among troops according to German military authorities the use of deception to achieve surprise is comparatively unexploited speed of execution of any maneuver is an essential is essential for achieving surprise this principle is extended to artillery practice and observer notes that as much importance is now put on the speed of opening fire as an accuracy and as the attainment of heavy volume of fire so you're going to surprise people again this is a speed surprise and violence of action that's what you learn day two at the SEAL team section seven training methods subsection twenty physical conditioning and marching the importance of physical condition is fully recognized in German training doctrine one of the services of the Hitler youth with its emphasis on sports and the labor service is to furnish the army with recruits who are fully conditioned and toughened the training period is thereby shortened and made more effective a US observer saw an infantry battalion on maneuvers in January 1940 with the temperature at 20 degrees the troops lay patiently in four inches of snow waiting their orders for over an hour many men had no gloves this difficult period seemed to have no effect on their performance later the hardening other observers of a German division in the field exercises before the outbreak of war reported that fitness and endurance were made a fetish by both officers and men the training purposes officers vote sorry for training purposes officers often went 24 hours without food troops carried heavy loads of mortars machine guns and other equipment as far as 1200 yards in fast rushes of 50 yards just before the exercises one engineer battalion had marched 85 miles through the mountains in three days good physical condition has been a basis for the notable March achievement of the German infantry despite all the mechanization of modern armies German doctrine for saw the possibility that motorized personnel might lose their equipment and have to move rapidly on foot in some cases German troops under the prolonged strain of combat operations have covered 30 to 40 miles a day for several days and German sources claim a march of 44 miles and 24 hours during the Polish campaign reserve formations of older men or heart are held to nearly the same high standards despite these achievements demand is made for even grading greater attention to marching an article in a German military review from 1940 states peacetime marching practice though good was not strenuous enough to prepare men for wartime marching conditions in peacetime marching too much consideration is given to the comfort and convenience of the troops despicable tone added by me yeah thoroughness realism in german training methods is one aspect of their general demand for thoroughness german officers in particular and the enlisted men as well are taught to regard themselves as men engaged in a highly skilled and highly honorable profession and to take pride in acquiring the details of military techniques to encourage this point of view soldiers are put as little as possible on fatigue work and non-military labors which are performed by civilians and the last thing we'll talk about from this document is marksmanship journey german training has tended to put emphasis on volume of fire rather than accuracy an observer believes that their ability to concentrate fire at vital point is superior to our own but that their standards of markmanship are inferior however a german article in late 1941 makes the point that volume of mechanical fire will not replace accurate individual shooting and that sharp shooters can perform invaluable tactical missions so they they did concentrate on volume of fire and they concentrate on marksmanship the basic skills of shooting and there you have it and and as you can see many of those principles are the same principles that are taught in the u.s military and really the same principles that are taught by any sort of leadership education right and and that's why it's very strange to read this document and recognize that these principles are being utilized by the most evil or at least one of the top evil empires to have ever existed and yet they're talking about taking care of their people and and making sure everyone understands the why and you can see as i mentioned earlier that that while these principles were implemented down the chain of command clearly at the top these principles didn't exist at all the tyrannical leader of hitler massive ego driven by his own insecurities driven by paranoia lack of trust like all these things that these book this book talks about the hitler didn't have and that's why you end up in this disaster and this horrific the the horrific atrocities that that the nazis created in the horrific atrocities of the war which which you know what you you know you were talking about earlier i kind of made funny you about like oh the world didn't exist before i was here but this is a good way of putting it from claus witz no general can supply his army with war experience and the substitute of peacetime drills is a weak one when compared with the actual experience in war it is much more important that peacetime drills be so arranged that a part of the causes for friction occur and that the judgment the wisdom the prudence and the decision of the individual leaders are tested that is believed by those who do not know from this experience so you got to go if you haven't been a war you got to go even harder than you think it is of utmost importance that the soldier of high or low grade no matter what position he may occupy should experience those difficulties which perplex and surprise him in actual war if they have happened to him but once before he's already somewhat familiar with them this even applies to physical strains they must be practiced not so much that nature but that the brain becomes accustomed this is so absolutely critical and you know I was so lucky to have been where I was in and be able to run training in the SEAL teams because we just were able to execute on this we are just absolutely able to execute on this 100% and give super hard training stressful training decisions that need to be made under time under stress under pressure with mayhem going on communication breaking down like we're able to do this over and over again if you're a platoon commander you're going to do this 12 times in 12 nights or in three nights or four nights you're going to be put in these stressful situations you would start to get used to it and your troops get used to it this is why law enforcement training needs to step it up so then I thought back to your you know scenario where you're hiring set designers and you're like talking about burning tires and doing all this little stuff that I'm like I'm curious if there's a burning tire or not you know like probably you're here to do the mission the burning tires not gonna distract you the thing is it wouldn't be surprising to me given what I already know everything would be distraction if you haven't seen it before the burning tire it's kind of like that's kind of a big distraction actually when you think about it or it could be and if you got put down someone's gonna have to carry you out and if you're getting carried out you're gonna get dropped you're gonna get food like it sucks for everyone and so when it would actually when you would watch the guys going through like a urban scenario getting shot with paintball they would just charge through it like they didn't care like in the structures if they're gonna put you down they put you down but when on the laser tag system it had a near miss little you had a speaker on your shoulder so when you would get shot at it would go you know make a little noise or you know soup not here you know like that just as a whatever that kind of expression it kind of says the opposite of that where it's like you better do it correctly or almost feels like they're saying do it correctly or don't do it all almost kind of things what it feels like nonetheless it does feel like do not make a mistake yeah we started falling part of the end of world war one why the more we talked the less people understood what was happening that's a that's a freaking very interesting very interesting dichotomy this is an interesting statement here when we start talking about the way these guys are sort of living their lives no German officer begins the day without a mission if the mission has not been received received from higher authority he gives himself a mission for the day and one which is definitely not a mere compliance with a printed schedule the printed schedule is nothing but a time allotment or control he approaches this is the German officer approaches each day's task as he would a battle in order that eventually he will approach battle as he would a day's task just kind of live in the life the manual of troop leadership says on this subject of orders the order puts the decision into effect clear orders are essential for the frictionless cooperation of all commanders for the higher commander the written order provides the foundation for leadership it is communicated to the lower units printed in carbon copy type written or written by hand or by technical communication means frequently is dictated dictated over the telephone in every instance the most sure and suitable method of transmission is to be chosen the more pressing the situation the shorter the order is a mistake everybody makes what's what's challenging about that is in order for me to give you an order in a pressing situation I have to be able to look at the situation simplify it and then distill it the order down into something that's like hey we need to move north now right it's it's kind of inconceivable in some ways to understand the broad absolute horror of world war two and the holocaust and the the deaths the the woundings the loss of life the destroyed communities it's it's it's kind of hard to really truly understand that those things occurred at all it can be very bit difficult to understand that they seem inconceivable i guess if you truly look at it season it seems inconceivable if you think about the millions of people you know millions of people millions of people dying it's hard to it's hard to understand a million dollars it's hard to understand you know a million a million people going to a you know at a at a big giant arena there's only a hundred thousand people there picture that times 10 and then that's there you have a million and each one of those people is an individual with a family and dreams and a life and and and thoughts and when you start talking about the scale of death and destruction in world war two one thing troops in training exercises are provided with large amounts of practice ammunition of all sorts including grenades usually with reduced charges but nevertheless requiring careful handling and involving some risk machine gun fire ball ammunition over the heads of attacking troops with very small safety margin and trench mortars support the infantry within 50 yards of of its objective a German officer of engineers told an observer that we have considerable losses in wartime training but this is unavoidable in familiarizing the men in handling of explosives and becoming an expert the men know that losses in training would mean fewer losses in battle in field exercise the enemy is always represented by actual soldiers who advance in retreat delay flyer fire blanks and otherwise conduct themselves at the enemy should barbed wire shell holes trenches artillery emplacements and all the other features of actual combat are introduced as far as possible in every exercise remember when you guys for training got the laser tag system whatever it's called when you shot it was it what did the gunfire was it like it was a blank so I'm like whatever though what we'll practice or whatever and from week to week you'd be different you could feel the difference with who we're playing and they'd all be the same guys guys on our team right in practice but rewind back to that first game and the first time you play and you see the exact same thing as we were practicing it's different jerseys which is weird but even that little detail it's kind of like whoa that kind of stood out you could see the little differences like oh I've been used to this practice so much you know over these weeks or whatever the littlest difference stands out so the more accurate you can make it the better so you don't get distracted by all these little differences it's a hard one to contemplate sometimes I will I regret to inform you that the world has been here before you were here at the world was not created the moment I was born all right cool just saying emphasis on field exercises even the training at the German General Staff avoids abstract theory in tactics and strategy the students thoroughly grounded in fundamental principles of tactics but he is taught to apply them concrete by case study method in which a specific situation must be stated and solved tactical training at the school is given almost entirely by means of free maneuvers on the map and on the ground no fixed divisional organization is used in this training and the combination of arms and division is continually varied the exercises are so conducted that the officer student as commander and his staff oppose either the instructor or another student group the student is given very little information of the enemy positions and is required to make immediate decisions put into verbal orders movement is controlled by factors of time space terrain firepower and mobility and by no other control features coordination of effort is assured by staff action during movement rather than by attempting elaborate plans in advance field work is done is field work is given central emphasis in the program of training for troops small units carry out tactical problems day in day out tactical exercises fill in half the time training this is just squared away is to look at complex situation and simplify them and then verbalize what needs to happen that's something you can practice that's something you should think about all the time that's something when you when you are going to talk to your team you should write down what you're going to say and say it in as few words as possible that's one thing I kind of liked about Twitter back back in the day when I was on Twitter a lot it was fun you had to like you had to like you had 140 characters and then they made it easy gave you 280 characters but back in the day 140 characters you had that's what you're going to do it's good practice became ambiguous after one I did you know there's a that always reminds me of the ethics life I've said that twice now I'm a little scared I don't want to make that a thing knowledge of terrain the usual attention is paid in German training to correct use of maps as a basis for utilizing terrain and maneuver but the German doctrine is that maps should be so thoroughly studied that they can be largely dispensed with during maneuvers and observer who commented on the small use of maps during tank exercises was told that the officer who must constantly refer to a map for orientation purposes considered poorly trained the map one study should be carried in the mind rather than in the hand that's when you get in the military that's sort of like from a leadership perspective understanding terrain is like blue belt level like so you're not catching me on that one i know as evil as if you were to you know how like i'm sure there was some point in your life where you like looked into sugar a little bit deeper than maybe you do daily and then realize oh shoot this is kind of there's some issues with sugar sugar is like evil you could start looking back into it and probably find some more stuff it's crazy thinking about those times like those were actual real times you know like before you were born you know it feels like in your brain it's almost like Realism the realism of training no element of training doctrine is given more stress than the demand for a maximum effect of realism claus witz the guide of so much modern military theory stated the principle very exactly at a period when the methods and techniques of warfare put less strain than they do now on the troops entering battle for the first time that's an interesting statement like hey back in the day is nothing compared to what you're going into combat in 1942 and there's machine guns and you know miss or schmitz overhead strafing your area and people are just getting blown up like this is a totally different ballgame A book called Company Commander this is a German book a book called Company Commander says the Company Commander is a living example to every man in his organization to be an officer means to set an example for the men the officer must be his soldiers incarnation of soldiery his model if the German officer is inspired by this mission the best and deepest qualities of his soul will be awakened his life's aim will be fulfilled if he succeeds through knowledge demeanor and conviction in forcing his troops to follow him this is the manly purpose for which it is worthwhile to stake life in order to win life in Germany the road to rank of officer is open to every capable soldier the destination destination can be reached only by efficiency in time of war and by actions in face of the enemy the real authority of an officer is recreated daily by his entire attitude the ancient proverb applies earn it in order to possess it the more his men are convinced that the authority of his rank is deserved through moral worth the stronger will be the influence of the officer's personality no one should accept that rank attained by promotion will give to his position authority sufficiently high enough for him to relax his effort in the belief that the objective has been reached real authority is not dependent upon shoulder straps stars and badges it depends only on efficiency and worth again you can't argue with that and this is you know I just need a few more troops to go no go hold on we're gonna hold we got set security no go hold on I need to figure out what the enemy's doing no go the weaker the force through speed mobility great march accomplishment surprise and deception the utilization of darkness and terrain to the fullest can be stronger at the decisive area time and space must be correctly estimated favorably situations favorable situations quickly recognized and decisively exploited every advantage over the enemy increases our own freedom of action the attack is launched in order to defeat the enemy the attacker has the initiative superiority of leadership and of troops shows to the best advantage in the attack success does not always come to the superiority of numbers a German officer commenting on the clearly commenting early on the early campaigns of the war recognized the capacity of very young officers to meet these standards of leadership so this is pretty impressive before the campaign in the West we underestimated the wonderful leadership of our 22 year old company commanders they acted without hesitation where older men would have paused for long consideration and heavy artillery reinforcements time and time again we found these young commanders calling for a few 88 millimeter anti aircraft guns a handful of anti-tank guns and a platoon pie a platoon of pioneers to assist them in taking a famous fortress and then actually capturing it with no delay and relatively few losses the enthusiastic leadership of youth was one of the great features of our advance West
