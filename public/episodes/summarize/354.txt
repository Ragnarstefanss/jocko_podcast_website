and they they want to get you into a very short term mindset and get you to say things that you know to be against your interests the problem is if you're getting somebody into a short term mindset they're going to come a point in time when they regret saying it to you and you're going to lose their cooperation everything's going to fall apart so it has a shelf life now the rapport based people those are the magic magic magicians that make cases nobody else can make or make deals no one else can make and the other side still wants to talk to them like when I left surveillance in New York and went inside to investigate what we were talking earlier became an inside you know open investigator I was surrounded by guys that had gotten cooperation from witnesses voluntarily that people would just say like I got no idea how that guy got that cooperation one agent particularly his name is Larry Wack and even on the task force people admired how he got people to cooperate because he was he was he developed a rapport relationships with people even if he had a hammer the rapport and the relationship you know the belief that we will always be able to talk to one another as opposed to me tricking you into a short term mindset which at some point in time you're going to feel betrayed like the rapport based approach to deal making interrogation wins every time same thing with leadership we might as well throw leadership in there as well agree the time I say well you know if you don't do this I'm going to fire you or whatever it'll work for that task but I talked about asking earnest questions as a leader you're asking earnest questions and you've got this little bit similar approach but different verbiage here calibrated questions are not just random requests for comment they have a direction once you figure out where you want a conversation to go you have to design the question that will ease the conversation in that direction while letting the other guy think it's his choice to take you there that's why I refer to these questions as calibrated questions you have to calibrate them carefully just like you would calibrate a gun sight or a measuring scale to target a specific problem the good news is that there are rules for that first off calibrated questions avoid verbs like can is are do or does these are close ended questions that can be answered with a simple yes or no instead they start with a list of words people know as reporters questions who, what, when, where, why and how those words inspire your counterpart to think and then speak expansively but let me cut that list even further it's best to start with what, how and sometimes why nothing else who, when and where will often just get your counterpart to share a fact without thinking and why can backfire regardless of what the language, what language the word why is translated into it's accusatory there are very rare moments when this is to your advantage the only time you can use why successfully is when defending, when defensiveness that is created supports the change you are trying to get them to see why would you ever change from the way you've always done things to try my approach as an example so I found this very useful because you know I often talk about something from a military perspective called the indirect approach which means I don't want to attack you head on I want to, you know, I want to attack you from a flank where you're not defensive and this applies to everything it applies to leadership it applies to approaching people it applies to, you know, if you've got an ego which everyone does and I attack your plan that means I'm attacking your ego you're going to get defensive but you got to recognize what the best possible outcome is so it's a great metaphor for making tiny little subtle changes in your negotiation approach the other side is never going to see where you're going to make all the difference it's completely invisible and then while you're in the middle of it there's always stuff the great stuff will fall out of the sky if you let it the other side is going to say something that works for you they're going to talk to you they're going to be softer in a position and you realize there's going to be pressures on them that you don't understand something is always always there and in many cases the other side doesn't imagine it and to draw a real fine point on this that a lot of people miss it's a reason why reading body language to detect deception is almost a waste of time because for you to deceive me you've got to know it's important to have a tell you have to be consciously covering it up but a significant amount of the time you don't even know it's important so if I'm just looking for towels and not getting you talking the stuff that you didn't know is important is never going to come out those those similarities building relationships across the board so you just mentioned the analyst that's one type of person you got a whole section here about not only you what kind of negotiator are you because you got to know yourself but then also how are you going to interact with these people you got the analyst that you talked about which is methodical diligent they're not in a big rush you talked about them tell me about the accommodator just the so being an assertive the accommodators is weird animal that neither the analysts nor the assertive can really figure out but the accommodators really is a very hope based person and very focused on that the moment is pleasant and then if the moment is pleasant and we hope hard enough then everything will be fine now when we wrote when we wrote the book we said the accommodator was focused principally on the relationship having a positive relationship and that's pretty close to true like they want the relationship to be positive but you know we worked with people that would see a train coming at us rhetorically federal figuratively not literally his problem coming at us this person was on a team and we had a training and all the books that were supposed to be there were gone this guy knew about it for days the last minute tells us none of the manuals were here because he'd been and we're like you know this is the train is getting ready to hit us we've been here for three days you haven't said a word for three days that's not relationship focus because I'm standing on a railroad track and you see a train coming my way right go do it your way no never do that and the other one again this isn't just for negotiation this is for life bite your tongue when you're attacked in a negotiation pause and avoid angry emotional reactions instead ask your counterpart a calibrated question just such a solid move that will keep you out of trouble you want to say something back you know I actually go I tell people you know someone starts attacking you or someone someone starts getting aggressive with you you know take a step back kind of nod your head show them that you're listening don't say anything back to them instead ask them a question you know that's going to be a good way to go forward the 738 55% rule and two famous studies on what makes us like or dislike somebody UCLA psychology professor Albert Mayhabrian totally murdered that one you're not Persian I'm not you know how to say that if you're a Persian I don't know how to say it so what I need what I really want besides just throwing a number first I want to know what number do you think a good number is that you're gonna work really hard for and feel like you earned your money and not change that you just undervalued yourself in the past and now now all of a sudden I'm worth this much more money which means you're not gonna put in extra effort you're also talking here about if people are stuck on the money you can start talking about other things the non-monetary terms so like if you're negotiating for a job you start talking about things that don't have anything to do with money and that can be a good way to start to move the conversation forward the this is just interesting psychology the biggest thing to remember when you start when you do get to numbers you say the biggest thing to remember is that numbers that end in zero inevitably feel like temporary placeholders guesstimates that you can easily be negotiated off of but anything you throw out that sounds less rounded say $37,263 feels like a figure that you came to as a result of thoughtful calculation such numbers feel serious and permanent to your counterpart so use them to fortify your offers and she's labeling and marrying the next thing you know this this this thing comes out that the other person has no idea makes any difference changes the structuring of the whole deal now instead of talking about one film they're talking about multiple films completely changes the complexion of the the finances that are needed on the first if she go back out she's already got partial packaging on a second film like it changes everything and there's no way that she would have known to ask it and the person on the other side was well instead of 300 grand what about my castle because that's not going to do any good for a film in LA just little things like that one thing that emphasize the importance of listening is you know at one point you're talking about a case you got a guy that's you know drives to drives to Washington DC and a tractor he's gonna blow himself up he's gonna blow up some of the white ones but I just want to hit some of these highlights here let what you know your known knowns guide you but not blind you every case is new so remain flexible and adaptable black swans are leverage multipliers remember the three types of leverage and you go over these in the book positive which is the ability to give someone what they want negative the ability to hurt someone and normative using your counterparts norms to bring them around again there's more detail on the book inside the book work to understand the other sides religion what you just mentioned everybody's got a religion digging into worldviews inherently implies moving beyond negotiation table and into life emotional and otherwise of your counterpart that's where black black swans live you know you hear everything you hear from your counterpart you will not hear everything the first time so double check compare notes with team members use backup listeners exploit the similarity principle people are more apt to concede to someone when they share a culture someone they share a cultural similarity with you know dig for what makes them tick and show that you share common ground when someone seems irrational or crazy they most likely aren't faced with the situation search for constraints hidden desires and bad information and last get face time with your counterpart 10 minutes of face time often reveals than days of research pay special attention to your counterparts verbal and non verbal communication at unguarded moments at the beginning and the end of the session or when someone says something out of line so really good really just awesome points that apply to me they apply to business they apply to interacting with any human obviously they apply to negotiations but you've got the black swan group this is your consulting firm and quick description of the black swan black swan theory tells us that things happen that were previously thought to be impossible or never thought of it all this is not the same as saying that sometimes things happen against a one in a million odds but rather that things never imagined do come to pass the idea of the back black swan was popularized by the same to lab in his best selling books fooled by randomness and the black swan but the term goes back much further until the 17th century people could only imagine white swans because all swans ever seen had possessed white feathers in the 17th century London it was common to refer to impossible things as black swans but when the but then the Dutch explorer William Devlamin sorry people of Holland went to Western Australia I did indeed apologies down went to Western Australia in 1697 and saw a black swan suddenly the unthinkable and unthought was real this is a crucial concept in negotiation and every negotiation session there are different kinds of information there are those things we know like our counterparts name and their offer and our experiences from other negotiations those are known knowns there are those things we are certain that exist but we don't know like possibility that the other side might get sick and leave us without another counterpart those are known unknowns and they are like poker wildcards so it could be for different reasons the short answer is yes and the longer answer is how do you align your thinking in the moment a little bit of what you mentioned earlier like if you're really interested in what the other person is saying and then you worry about evaluating after the fact you don't have to worry about the look on your face as a matter of fact if you're really interested the more interested you look the more they're going to talk so if you can separate the two things out from evaluating judging what somebody said to just being making sure you fully understand then facial expressions are not a problem the people that have a problem with them and you know your guys faces turn red making all that's a characteristic principally of the assertive negotiator who can't wait to disagree and is holding it in the highly analytical type you know the people that seem completely emotionally detached when they think you're not looking they reveal everything and like their facial expressions their body language I mean they almost sometimes they look like they're twitching and I bet you have to admit that it immediately triggered feelings of defensiveness and discomfort these feelings are often subconscious and lead to irrational concession the second use of the f bomb is more nefarious in this one your counterpart will basically accuse you of being dense or dishonest by saying we've given you a fair offer the terrible little jab meant to distract your attention away from distract your attention manipulating to giving in if you find yourself in this situation the best reaction is to simply mirror the f that has just been a lot that you fair you respond positive let the words power do to them what it was intended to do to you following that with a label seems like you're ready to provide evidence that supports that which eludes to the opening of their books or otherwise handing over information that will either contradict their claim to fairness or give you more data to work with then you had previously right away you declaw the attack the last use of the f word is my favorite because it's positive and constructive it sets the stage for honest and empathetic negotiation here's how I use it early on in a negotiation I say I want you to feel like you're being treated fairly at all times so please stop me at any time if I'm being unfair and will address it it's simple and clear and sets me up as an honest dealer with that statement I let people know it's okay to use the word with me if they use it honestly as a negotiator you should strive for reputation of being fair you represent reputation precede you let it precede you in a way that paves success when I read all that I was like and I'd never gotten a hostage on a phone so between how does somebody get a hostage on a phone and who the heck is getting proof of life on our hostages like there was more than one buyer like I didn't know what to do with this so the case is an ongoing 13 month long train wreck a lot of people died including two out of three of the total Americans that were taken listen to a drug dealer kidnapping in Pittsburgh a few months afterwards drug dealer on drug dealer one drug dealer's got the other drug dealer's girlfriend hostage who do you go when somebody important to you has been kidnapped even if you're a drug dealer you go to the FBI so our hostage negotiator is right around listen to the drug dealer talk to the other drug dealer and just on his own he goes hey dog how do I know she's okay and so if you know who's highly analytical if you're faced with a team of people do not talk to the analytical guy or gal but keep an eye on them you gotta kind of watch them out of the corner you're right because they're going to be rolling their eyes and they're going to be sneaking peaks at people and moments I mean like they are the most honest most unguarded body language you ever saw in your life if they don't think they're being stared at let me ask you this so I've been talking about leadership you're talking about you write about negotiation how much interaction because there's also a ton of similarities with interrogators how much interaction did you have with interrogators I mean I obviously worked with a ton of interrogators and a bunch of different organizations how much work did you do with interrogators fair amount and there's that statement is when when you were totally bought in on what was just said and as is and our co-author tall was one that pulled out the description of it being a subtle epiphany tall contributed brilliantly to the book I mean he brought a lot to the table besides just being a writer and so then as I was getting more into neuroscience I look up neuroscience the neuroscience of epiphany what neurochemicals do you get hit with you get hit with serotonin and oxytocin and oxytocin is the bonding drug so they hence people bonded to Donald Trump or any other leader you're you're bonded to Obama you're bonded to whoever has ordered the things that you believe to be completely true there's this it's a one way bond and there's a feeling of a bond and then again back to you were men's podcast you know for me just being bonded is enough and another one of his podcast he points out oxytocin and clients people to tell the truth so now not only you bonded to me you're more likely to tell me the truth and then he points out on yet another podcast serotonin the feeling of satisfaction which means you're not as demanding so if I can get it that's right out of you you're going to bond to me you're going to tell me the truth and you're going to make fewer demands what else do I want and then we don't bargain so if I got a thrown number I like to refer to as I never throw the number I'd naked if I and if otherwise I want to know where you're coming from I also want to give you a price that you want because price is a term and I need to hit the sweet spot on your price if I go too high you're not gonna over deliver you're gonna feel like you undervalued yourself and you're gonna do the same amount of work if I pay you too much I found that out the hard way if I go too low you're gonna do a lousy job and I remember thinking like how could that be I'm the nicest guy I know you know it's like what I said what I talked about earlier like me punching you in the face with the truth is not a good way to get you listen exactly echo always brings up the example of the person that says you know I'm just a direct person that's what the goal is each type has something really critical they bring to the table the the sort of I mean you gotta tell the aside where you come from otherwise you're making them gas you don't make good deals based on guesswork the analyst you gotta think things through you gotta come up with it run some number you don't have to run them all run any run some and the accommodator like so many people look at the accommodators and say that person's making tons of deals what are they doing it's in their demeanor it's in their approach the just FYI for people that are about to order this book you also kind of give how do you deal with the accommodator how do you deal with the assertive so you give both sides of the spectrum fast forward a little bit we mentioned this briefly this this Ackerman bargain bargaining But that idea, you know, for me, I'm like you, like, I don't want to be, I don't like to have like, I don't like to have to cover like lie about stuff and make stuff up. and so I saw that the idea like the impact of the highly improbable well that's what we did all the time in negotiation it's a combination of two things we're going to change ourselves and subtle little ways that the other side is never going to see and we're going to gain the upper hand we're going to steer it we're going to steer the negotiation and to the best possible outcome now that that doesn't mean that everything's going to a positive outcome and the change in the tone of voice the kidnapper drug dealer went from thinking he was in charge to being having lost all control of negotiation and not knowing it at the time and it was just a how question so then we changed all of our negotiation kidnapping strategy to how and what questions just hammering them with how and what questions because you want to test it out on the kidnapping and finally I'm coaching on another kidnapping in the Philippines coaching a brother his brother's been grabbed by a serial killer loan kidnapper only time in my entire experience with one kidnapper they're always operating gangs and the guy was a we found out after the fact because we caught him he was a multiple kidnappings and it killed at least well didn't have the evidence that he killed a hostage in another case just a ransom was paid and the hostage never appeared so there's only one conclusion we're coaching a brother again a good guy who would learn pick up fast how and what questions how and what questions how and what questions and at one point in time the kidnapper wants a daily prudence to keep the hostage alive which we had to fight over that because it's a way to test financial resources not to keep the hostage alive test the family's resources so on his own the brother says when we run out of money paying the daily amount what's going to happen and there's a silence and a serial killer on the other end of the phone says it'll be sorry there Albert we'll call him Albert Dr. Albert created the 738 55 rule only 7% of a message is based on the words while 38% comes from the tone of the voice and 55% from the speaker's body language and face while these figures mainly relate to situations where we are forming an attitude about someone the rule nonetheless offers a useful ratio for negotiators you see body language and tone of voice not words are our most powerful assessment tools important to remember that important to pay attention a lot of us a lot a lot of people your face it gives away so much and it doesn't even matter what you're saying the look that you have on your face is just giving away the way you feel and it doesn't even matter what your words are did you feel like you had to learn to you know control your facial expressions my business partner and my friend Leif Babin you know he when we first started working together when he was pissed you knew it but you don't know who has them but most important are those things we don't know that we don't know piece of information we've never imagined that would be game changing if uncovered maybe our counterpart wants the deal to fail because he's leaving for a competitor these unknown unknowns are black swans so this is obviously something highly important to you since you named your company the black swan how did you stumble upon this idea the first Talib's book in 2007 a black swan got me thinking about it I like his stuff and they told me that I said this guy just promised never to kill a hostage like I had no idea that it was a lone guy I thought we were just talking to the boss didn't know he was a killer it was another case where he chopped a victim's ear off sent the ear and video of him chopping the ear off to the victims company they got paid I knew about that I've been told for a variety of reasons I'd heard about that I didn't know it was this guy take him completely out of his game with a version of what question saw another one took another guy completely out of his game with a version of the how question and a dynamic where you said we had no leverage if you thought in terms of leverage right I'm skipping ahead a little bit in the book the f word why it's so powerful when to use it and how the most powerful word in negotiations is fair as human beings were might least swayed by how much we feel we have been respected people comply with agreements if they feel they've been treated fairly and lash out if they don't once you understand what a messy emotional and destructive dynamic fairness can be you can see why fair is a tremendously powerful word and you need to use it with care in in fact of the three ways that people drop the f bomb only one is positive the most common is a judo like defensive move that destabilizes the other side this manipulation usually takes the form something like we just want was fair think back to the last time someone made this implicit accusation of unfairness to you and it is if they're giving you your right you got problems be careful with that one look for that's right next section bend their realities and and you get into this here don't compromise which is interesting thing we're going to talk through the win-win mindset pushed by so many negotiation experts is usually ineffective and often disastrous at best it satisfies neither side and if you employ it with the counterpart who has a win-lose approach you're setting yourself up to be swindled of course as we've noted previously you need to keep a cooperative rapport building a pathetic approach the kind that creates a dynamic in which deals can be made but you have to get rid of that naivete because compromise splitting the difference can lead to terrible outcomes compromise is often a bad deal and a key theme will hit in this chapter is no deal is better than a bad deal even in kidnapping yes a bad deal in kidnapping is where someone pays and no one comes out to make my point on compromise let me paint an example a woman wants her husband to wear black shoes with a suit but her husband doesn't want her he prefers brown shoes so I'm going to be honest with you that was stupid that's a dumb idea that's never going to work you didn't think this thing you know the assertive anybody that describes themselves as simply open and honest and it's always a punch in the face it's always just that approach like you the other side's got to know where you're coming from you do have to be honest but she's mirroring and labeling and out of the blue it comes out that the financier owns a castle in France which would be a great setting for the next film something she never would have brought up the financier they're talking about a film being shot in LA martial arts this and that all these other little things you know female martial artists beating up bad guys like how is she gonna say oh by the way you don't have I'm working on another film we want to it's a medieval film you don't have to have a castle in France do you like that is never going to come up ever and so how much they need to have a great party that weekend that's sort of the number that you would end up looking for I mean it's awesome splitting the differences wearing one black and one brown shoe don't compromise meeting halfway often leads to bad deals for both sides approaching deadlines entice people to rush the negotiating process do impulsive things that are against their best interests we talked about the F word you can bend your counterparts' reality by anchoring his starting point before you make an offer emotionally anchor them by saying how bad it will be when you get to numbers set an extreme anchor to make your real offer seem reasonable or use a range to seem less aggressive the real value of anything depends on what vantage point you're looking at it from and last people tend people take more risks to avoid a loss than realize a gain make sure your counterpart sees that there's something to lose by inaction that's why the website says today only you'll miss out you got a section in here that's about fast forward a little bit calibrated question calibrate your questions and we kind of discussed this earlier if we were a cordon or not and you guess he wears one black shoe and one brown shoe is this the best outcome in fact no in fact it's the worst possible outcome either of the two outcomes black or brown would have been better I'm here to call bullshit on compromise right now we don't compromise because it's right we compromise because it's easy and because it saves face we compromise in order to say that at least we got half the pie distilled to his essence we compromise to be safe most people in negotiation are driven by fear or by the desire to avoid pain to free you are driven by their actual goals so don't settle here's a simple rule never split the difference creative solutions are almost always preceded by some degree of risk annoyance confusion and conflict accommodation and compromise produced none of that you've got to embrace the hard stuff that's where the great deals are and that's what negotiators do amen at the class amen what point did you realize that was the title of the book tall came up with that the original title was killer deals we started working with tall Brandon and I my son Brandon uncredited co author of the book and tosses but he got Steve Jobs do which is even better but you anchor those emotions the other thing you say is let the other guy go first most of the time I suggest you let the other side anchor monetary negotiations the real issues that neither side is a perfect information going on the table this means if you don't know enough to open up with confidence so this is what we hear all the time in negotiations you know you don't say the number first how much do you how much will you give me for the car and we see it constantly they're hoping something good happens at the last minute everybody's saved my colleague Derek would say you know an accommodator walk you into a minefield knowing it's a minefield hoping you don't step on a mine and so the accommodators I think are the source of why in the business world people often say hope is not a strategy because the accommodator will go with hope alone and it'll work out hope alone is probably good somewhere between 20 and 45% of the time maybe that maybe that's being generous maybe 20% of the time and they're going to remember the 20% and ignore the 80% when the world turned into a disaster so the accommodators are really are very positive people they're very upbeat well actually I don't I buy like the whole thing whatever that is $1.29 sometimes so they jack the prices some key points all negotiations are defined by a network of subterranean desires and needs don't let yourself be fooled by the surface once you know that the Haitian kidnappers want party money you'll be better, you'll be miles better for beer and there's a whole section in here about that about these Haitian kidnappers you worked all kinds like dozens of cases of these Haitian kidnappers one of the things you've identified is they would like kidnap early in the week they wanted that money by Friday so they could go out and party but you got influence how do you get influence to deference and that's when we really began to dial in collectively principally my son Brandon and I got Derek Gawant very involved in the development of our thinking and we really narrowed it down to how and what is a way to really get the upper hand in a negotiation fast forward a little bit here you got a couple things that are awesome points don't try to force your opponent to admit that you are right aggressive confrontation is the enemy of constructive negotiation I always say when you're dealing with someone give them an out you just give them an out you can say seems like this is the best way to do it and it is so effective that the manipulators have seen the good people use it and change the dynamics that they've gotten really good at using it to cover up manipulative behavior watch out for that one got a section in here bend their reality you start going to some of the methodologies of that anchor their emotions to bend your counterparts reality you have to start with the basics of empathy so start out with an accusation with an accusation audit acknowledging all of their fears by anchoring their emotions in preparation for a loss you inflame the other side's loss aversion so that they'll jump at the chance to avoid it you talk about loss aversion people are people don't want to lose right But yeah you know what I realized about you what I might have told you this before where your your interest is like it's like an 80 20 where you like how things work for sure but only like 20 percent 80 percent is you're interested in and I remember thinking that's the guy I want talking to the White House that's the guy that I want talking to the Department of State and we're in the midst of that shilling case and the last thing that we need when we're in a forward operating base is any sort of insecurity in decision from Washington DC and when you're out there on the front lines having a guy like Captain Bill McCraven Admiral Bill McCraven holding things together back in Washington DC just ridiculously reassuring feeling that he was a great guy I don't know about it that's awesome there's a big difference that's you see it and usually it's it's when the tables and gotten turned on somebody in an unexpected way that's when they'll drop the word what does that look like a person I know who's an eminently fair person was in a real estate negotiation right after the housing market where they were at drops substantially and they got the buyer to increase the offer above market by simply saying we just want what's fair now the person that uses phrase had gotten the table tables turned on them by dropping a market so it wasn't even the buyer's fault I didn't do anything buyers following the market so the number first because it's information it's gonna it's gonna tell me it's gonna tell me data it's gonna tell me mindset where you're coming from it's gonna tell me a lot none of which am I getting if I go first so it's a general rule we don't go first again a general rule it's at some point in time to keep from going around and around around I'm gonna throw a number out but when you actually have you're having conversations with him and you've got multiple people listening right because listening is so important that if you look if you can get more more than one person you get two or three or four people listening to the conversation and they're gonna pick things up that someone else might miss and studying the transcript so you had someone on the team that realize number one he was a veteran how can we utilize that and then someone realized he was like a I don't want to say fundamentalist Christian but
