if this one collapses and I look up and I'm like there's no way this is gonna and we're like we all dive out like the doors you know it's like this wide the doors open this wide like 20 guys get through that thing in like five seconds you know and the whole thing collapses and so so there was no power for like six weeks there's no water there is no anything and there were bodies laying in the ditches all over the place of course in town they have like generators going and everything's going like two days later they're like up and running nothing ever happened and then we had like the they call them the NPA like the the Vietnam Equivalent or the Philippine equivalent of the Vietnamese Communist so you don't want them to be too high because like you think about you know if you're in a fist fight can you remember your phone number like probably not right because like your prefrontal cortex that ain't working like you're not going to be planning your next trip or something while you're while you're in something stressful so that you know that's one factor now another factor is if you sleep really well and if you don't stress a lot during the day even if you short sleep it's it's not as big of a deal right because the quality of sleep is keeping your stress hormones lower like the lowest your stress hormones ever are when you're in deep sleep and of course they peak somewhere in the afternoon like I've heard 11 to 1 1 to 3 like I it seems to be somewhere on noon to 1 in most of the people I test you know that as you know it as that peak goes up people are feeling more and more alert their body temperature is going up there's all sorts of like good physiological things going on but people feel better under more stress hormones and you can go excessive and it becomes it becomes negative but just the fact that you're not somebody who stresses a lot like one of the one of the biggest things I do and that was like a policy job really because a lot of people don't realize this but like every country that has submarines like they all they all have this agreement that will will rescue each other submarines even our enemies like China Russia doesn't matter like your submarine goes down on our waters and it's saveable we'll use our system to save your guys because technically these systems can go anywhere in the world but with a realistic time when there's probably not in realistic to like fly it over there and set everything up so you're gonna be much better off of the country that you're closest to saves them and so then you have to make all these agreements like well who whose patients are they gonna be whose dive tables are we're gonna use we have to recompress them like what like what's gonna be our product and so that's all we did is travel around the world and meet endless meetings and come up with new policy and then then I had the opportunity to either go back to the hospital or go to the teams I was like I really feel like I should do that and so then I go back to the teams and that's right when they called it and so I have those people set an alarm clock like an hour before bed and this is a generally a good idea but like anything else if you have problems be super like be fastidious and with this and like be exact and be you know very regimented and then once you get healthy sleep back just like once you get fit you don't have to do everything that you had to do to get in good shape like you just generally adhere to those principles so like but when you're having problems like setting an alarm clock an hour before it's time to go to bed I one of the CEOs out there he got like in the couple of years I was treating him you know like three PRs like like weight lifting and running and like say something else and like in his 40s like this is the best he's ever been in his life because he's you know he's been broken down we and like our community has some of that just because of the chaotic sleep and that's kind of like what happened to you because it takes a while for ideas to get accepted he he rolls out this one example of with the major changes that have been made to warships over the past whatever it is 200 years every major change that came like no one accepted it until like somebody got martyred and then you know like going from whatever from sale to like steam right this first guy's like are you an idiot what are you gonna do when you're out at sea and there's no coal you're an idiot like we can sail forever and sure enough these guys get fired and then the next guy says you know we should make the holes out of out of metal and set a wood were you an idiot how are you gonna repair those they're heavier than more all those things and that's what happens so if you're the if you're the first person to roll out if you're not careful now you can be careful you can get it done in a more this is what he talks about and so I got there right when they were funding the build out of that clinic nice of course I was a perfect fit for that some freaking PT clinics like duh like I did this for I did this all through college like I know what I'm doing so and then like and there's a great time like I got to be there when we hired everybody like when we hired the first you know the first athletic trainer the first PT the first nutritionist the first strength and conditioning coach like which is crazy to think about everything that you're just saying is the first the first the first the first but the sleep is crap and that's a disaster the other thing is when you talk about stress I mean I don't stress about a lot like even like and I think it's getting you know you get used to in the teams like what what you know I wrote about in this book like what you got to know what to worry about what's important what's not important and for me the list of things that are important is this list that has like four things on it is like is your fam is my family healthy my my 21st birthday to walk I can't remember I can't remember any of the names of the bars but we walk into this one bar it's really common one and Jason was standing up on the bar when I when I walked in choked a beer and then like slammed the bottle around why because I can't I'm like I'm gonna like this guy so that wasn't my birthday I take it back that's like when we first that was just like a Tuesday night that was like the first that's like the first time I think I'd been out in town right you have a three four year old kid bashing trucks together banging drums whatever you don't just throw that kid in a bed and turn the light on walk out they need a ritual they need time to get ready to go to sleep we study hunter gatherers today makes it's like 30,000 people who've never experienced electricity never experienced electricity they still live like our ancestors live they go out they hunt food hunting gather food for two hours a day the rest of the day they're fucking off having sex playing around whatever like they're the original aristocrat like that's where we would be if we stayed in that lifestyle so like you take your kid and what do you do it's like it's time for quiet play right put that stuff away so I think when they they they like shut me down and have me under investigation for a while and like I mean I essentially sacrificed my career for like there was no way I was getting any kind of Navy residency or anything because I was just in trouble all the time with Bumad or the hospital or Warcom whatever like everybody's then even like my name out about that I was practicing outside of my scope that I was like I was giving people was called Myers cocktails when I thought that it was adrenal fatigue IV vitamins apparently I'm not allowed to do that as a doctor and I'm like I feel like I'm I feel like I'm going the wrong I'm trying to remember what the building was like I was like I feel like I'm going the wrong way I remember I was doing I was training a guy for a fight an MMA fight and He was like ground and pound like we had gloves on like we're going at it and all of a sudden like I did something where I did A quick head movement and all of a sudden I got super like like more even more dizzy than normal I think I did like I participated in like 25% of that school like they couldn't make pants for me I have really big legs and kind of a normal waist and they kept making they're like trying to make khaki pants like from scratch like these girls and they were ridiculous I mean and I was like the most exciting thing I did which is kind of one of the reasons I got out is like you know it's just like the same training trips over and over again doing the same stuff over and over again it's like I don't think we're ever gonna go to war again like I'm gonna go do something else you know it's there's there's variation like when I was in I mean obviously the whole time I was in college and the whole time I was in medical school like I had a married and have kids you know like I'm coming over medical school like making dinner for my kids you know giving them baths reading them to sleep deprivation like it and so it's mainly like you know big executives or entrepreneurs traded their health for wealth for 20 or 30 years and now they had like a big exit whatever like you know they sold their company they have a hundred million dollars don't care about money they want to buy that health they want to be division one athletes again I'm like pump the brakes Sparky like maybe we can get you we can drop 40 pounds of fat off you in the year and get you back into being able to be physical I'm like yeah that matters like I said regards of how you feel now if you start having some serious problems and you need surgery revision like big care like that's you know what what if you know what what if and so he's he's like and it was like that for every injury like shin splints if you're at Bud's Medical you see 50 cases a week of shin splints and you just go down the list of shoulder injury and so the teams the same way like oh shoulder injury knee injury like you're just gonna see so many of it you get so good at it right that it's like an environment where you're just gonna learn so much it was great for you and like you know now at least you have wearables and you have people tracking their sleep and something like there's some you know there's something to make it a little easier for me and that and that respect but like there's I mean there's no question that's the most important aspect of your life and the big problem the other big problem of sleep is that when you so like the whole point of me going to sleep tonight is to repair everything that I did to myself today right everything that every fuel source I exhausted that needs to be replenished or any damage I've done that needs to be fixed and then I need to you store things and organize things and set hormone regulation for tomorrow I remember like one of the few days I was in khakis like somebody just remember she's super clear like way I sit in my desk and like remember putting this note the margin and then after he left I kept shadow files because none of the team guys wanted stuff in the record so I'm like I'm just keep a shadow file I give it to you when you leave you know I mean nobody nobody is like 100% of any fiber right and like in different muscles of your body you're going to have different makeup supplements so like everybody everybody couldn't train to some degree to get better at reasonably good at something if you really weren't it's just like any it's like your mental aptitude. and now you get more fat and more of your testosterone becomes estrogen and like it's this so defeating spiral I could just keeps getting worse like now you're getting fatter because your hormones are low but you're converting like you have higher estrogen levels because more fat means a more inspiring and so now you're know it's like it's the same thing of having high stress hormones because you're not sleeping well now you can't sleep because you have high stress hormones and now you know I'm not gonna get to sleep tomorrow you're gonna have even more stress so I can't get into any college I have to go to at least a year of junior college probably two and so I went there and like started setting the curve in every class that I thought maybe is gonna be like jadjee or something like an athletic trainer maybe a physical therapist if like things are really worked out great for me and to to apply to physical therapy school you have to like have 2000 volunteer hours I'm getting ready to go to bed like we we love that you know it's this this this is to support what you're talking about I know this a hundred percent if I don't get actually when I'm going to an event like if I'm gonna speak I sleep a little bit less because it makes me more and she's engaged with what's happening even more emotional like right I will be more emotionally engaged if I'm super well rested I'm just kind of like cool And by activity, I mean, you know, whatever, going on a walk doing like some zone to type of cardio, doing some movement, like you could do like whatever you could do like movement drills or something like that. and I think you kind of the thing about sleep like one of the things it makes then obviously I don't just do sleep but sleep to big component of what I do just because it's the most important factor of your health if I do my job well first of all the sales pitch sucks because what sleep good for everything what's the worst thing you can say in marketing like it fixes anything like every you're better at everything when you sleep well you're smarter you're faster stronger smarter you're better looking like everything everything's better lower stress hormones higher anabolic hormones better appetite regulation everything's better when you sleep Cause I like, I'd sit on the bottom of the pool, like I just want to stay here for like, and you know, now sort of I knew more of the physiology of like what I was now like a settling down my nervous system. and and I I managed to like put some pressure on a stroller and like pull him in to me and he and it was like essentially breaking his wrist backwards right because he and he couldn't get off of it because like the way his body position like he was just half his body weight was on his wrist and it was inverted and I'm just pulling on him and he's screaming they let him out so like I if I go to sleep I can't sleep eight hours like I will not sleep eight hours and not because of how many do you sleep I could have been at 10 30 wake up before 30 like that's kind of no seven hours six hours six hours six hours six hours six hours and sometimes I go to bed at 10 you know like they're six and a half hours and so I so I start walking to the patty wagon it's like a Toyota truck with like the built on kind of camper or whatever like a patty wagon thing and and the dude that I'd the tour patrol guy that I'd hit was like standing there holding the door smirking and said like said something smart he's like you have to treat everybody the same like no it's in the name special forces like they get special treatment like we're we're here because of the team guys we're not here for tech support like those guys can go to the hospital and so like what I was doing with the team guys is I was first doing it with like all supplements first I was getting guys to sleep and getting them off of the ambient right and that's that just came from me and I couldn't just say quit taking your ambient because our you know our community one is good two is better and three is probably great so they're taking like three ambient with we're taking seven they're taking three ambient with like a couple of cocktails and then they're waking up at 430 so I get her like just sleep hygiene just my sleep supplement no drugs no hormones like just like nutritional supplements and sleep hygiene ritual around sleep start sleeping eight hours and like as far as I know she still is you know like it was just like your PT was whatever your CO or whatever your exo was into so your exo like to run and swim guess what you were doing for PT like run swim swim run run if you got injured it was like but it's probably the only way to avoid becoming a martyr but for you you're sitting there looking at people that are hurting and you're like all right I'm gonna help you guys need help right now like it's totally totally worth it like I was fully aware of what I was doing I'm not I'm not whining about it like I knew what I was doing at the time I had a quote taped in my monitor from Buckminster Fuller said it said never fight the system create a superior system to make the old one obsolete and I was like what the hell like because I didn't understand the physiology at the time I'm like how can I still be gassing like all it like I'm doing all this endurance work We're like getting excited and like all these things and what I'm going to do, well, how much you know, compared to how much I know, what you know about my, like all this stuff, like is such a huge factor.
