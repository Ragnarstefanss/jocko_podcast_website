i mean seriously if a zombie apocalypse happens i look at there was a time when you know a person said i want a partner who's going to be there for me when it all goes down and now that decision isn't i want someone who who what look i understand that you know things have changed we can't change we have to be the same yesterday today forever and the military cannot adapt to this schizophrenic nature of hey today we believe the following individuals you know are a protected class today we believe the following individuals can reproduce today we believe the following i mean you want to kick out 15 000 people for vaccinations what did you do with anthrax did you dishonorably discharge them what did you tell them you said you don't want the anthrax well you know you're not going to defend your country with all the people you trained with for a year why don't you take the anthrax that was the choice mm-hmm am i going to not deploy with these men that i consider family to me because what i don't know what anthrax is if anthrax was naturally occurring outside of training grounds in san diego would people not respect you know this vaccination thing to me is is a is a is a object lesson and how we have completely decided that we want our universe instead of our university is becoming more like our our military we're deciding to make the military plug and play to everything that's happening in society and unfortunately the enemy gets a vote and the enemy doesn't give a damn about inclusiveness or feeling good the enemy wants to kill you they want to kill you as quickly as they possibly can and i don't want a military that feels good at the end of the day about who they are i want the military to feel good about who they are because they dominated the battle space and americans don't know what a mortar incoming or outgoing sounds like right that's a problem and you know what they're gonna happen again they're gonna happen again and there's there's there's always going to be war there's always going to be conflict what conversation do you have if that if that does go down in five years you're talking to an 18 year old and they're like did you foresee this coming how what you go to universities i know some people don't touch the the you know vassar giving the the talks on the circuit but one of the things that young people in college will always ask you know a veteran is what can we do to prepare for the future and sometimes the answer of you need to be prepared to kill 20 communist Chinese is you know 20 million people want you dead there's a way that we can say to the Chinese government the people of China are not the enemy the people of Russia are not the enemy the people of Iraq or Afghanistan are not the enemy but no Venezuelan leader or mullah and Iran or or forever leader of China is is going to dictate what the world how the world behaves so i i don't think the i would have told you at the end that i hung up my uniform that the world was better and safer and i'm i'm disgusted that you know as we grow into our twilight our kids are gonna have to learn to shoot move and communicate and that's heartbreaking and and and i don't know what how do you have that conversation there's only one thing that's more heartbreaking than that and that is if they don't learn to shoot move and communicate because if they don't learn to shoot move and communicate that will be overrun but we we ran you know quality guys and and and girls and in the process of doing that i meet all of these like there's a class that is started where there's like a professional veteran class that comes out of afghanistan and iraq and i'm super cognizant that i don't want to be that guy i don't want to be the dd214 guy in my car you know i don't want to be the guy that's low crawling to the copier you know it's like hey what time well zero niner we're gonna like stop another brief all right like you work at an office depot like you did not have an actual depot you know popsicle stick size blasting caps and they're like out there's some of them are hanging like speakers like just really poorly done not and the Brad just rattled everything so you got water and then there's broken mirrors everywhere and you could like look up in the corner and you could see a broken mirror through the fire in the night vision and you could see the corn so they saw us coming when we walked in but that worked two ways because I can see them at the 7-eleven that they built with their little mirrors everywhere and and then I I could hear one of the guys like doing his prayer like he was saying the same thing over and over again and that's when he started to he put he was screwing a fuse on a rocket it and his buddy under the stairwell was holding the rocket and he was basically fixing the rocket to fire the RPG he's got an open door behind him and I was like okay game's over Lawson's inside the guys are outside he fires that RPG at the you know I'm not MacGyver what you shoot a rocket at a bunch of flash explosives gonna blow up I don't I mean I want to see that right give me more diarrhea I want I want to see the enemy suffering and scared and not healthy right Michael Ware gave us a briefing on what type of enemy we're fighting and and the way that these guys you know they're rocket teams he's like you're gonna look for little designations one building is gonna have nothing but rockets in it the next building nothing but medical supplies the next building just bullets if you start fracking out like you're doing you're gonna get the wrong building and that whole thing is gonna go up he's like look they've read your your books they know how you like to enter buildings we would go into a building on the top floor all the stairs were removed all of them you would jump from a roof to another roof and they took out not only the roof but the second story as well you're falling all the way down to the first floor and they've got you know these rods and glass and a costa tina wire isis al-qaeda they may be watching this right now our military should not be mistaken for a cable news gab fest show we don't care what you look like we don't care who you voted for who you worship what you worship who you love it doesn't matter if your dad left you millions when he died or if you knew who your father was we have been honed into a machine of lethal moving parts that you would be wise to avoid if you know what's good for you we will not be intimidated we will not back down we've seen war we don't want war but if you want war with the united states of america there's one thing i can promise you so help me god someone else will raise your sons and daughters we fight so our children never have to we fight for one day when our children and our enemies children can discuss their differences without fear or loathing we fight so that anyone out there thinking about raising arms against our citizens or allies realizes the futility of attrition against a disciplined professional and lethal force built to withstand anything you can dream of throwing at us americans want this kind of country americans want this kind of world and we stand ready to defend it to protect us so help us god may god bless this beautiful army may god bless our marine corps our navy our air force and our coast guard may god bless our allies and we already know that god blessed america because he gave us the greatest fighting force this world has ever seen two two infantry and the first infantry division thank you ramrod's duty first dukes again to me that's the military that i tried to join that's the military i tried to represent when i was in and many of the those i served alongside that's exactly the way they felt and you captured it um incredibly i appreciate that um little editorializing at the end of the greatest fighting force the world's ever seen you know that might be hyperbole but my point in in that is that you know and they're enrolling stone magazine they're in they're on cnn they're talking about falconry hey turn on could you tape me fox news they're doing a special on on sarma falconry like what like is your son major like it was the it was a very surreal experience to go from the backwater and a unit that really peaked in vietnam to the first division back where it's cool again and all these guys who just did their jobs are now you know doing interviews you know you've got reporters that are sneaking out of the fob to interview the boys from falooja a month later and it's just like it was very surreal um you know because it's just a lot of attention and it's not necessarily people process it differently you know so i went until like my went to my freaking locker pulled out pictures of my wife and kids pinned them up took a picture took them all down put them back in the folder put it in the drawer and shut it because that's smart just like you were talking about like the last thing i needed to be thinking about over there was my wife and kids absolutely and and that seems like a maybe that seems like it's not healthy but i think it's completely healthy you got guys depending on your decision making without a doubt it doesn't mean that you don't love it's like whenever i see a facebook profile it's like joe and kim jones and i'm ready to go this isn't a meeting with you know tribal elders the first 45 minutes we're just gonna waste time talking about the weather show up be ready everything's cool you always got that guy that's going from like cubicle to cubicle asking how you doing what's going on they we have no line of like what's personal what are you doing this weekend none of your damn business bob get my my expense sheets don't you know what i mean like we're buddies you want to be friends i don't want to be friends i want to just get the get the job done you know what i mean with dry hair while we're at it and it it just like you're just like this is it like this is it it's gonna and so my whole thought process was get low suck up as many rounds as you can in the sampler plate in the helmet and if they're gonna hit you they'll hit your leg or they'll hit your you know your your arms but just bring bring those arms duck walk in as low as you can and just try to get well-aimed fire to keep their heads down and just kill these guys walk right into the bunker they'll never expect that just walk right in and it just ran away as soon as I pulled the trigger it was just for clarity what does that mean when you had a runaway so open bolt weapons close bolt you know the like a machine gun we train people for three second bursts and it's i get a lot of canadiens you know the canadiens we're close buffalo is close to toronto the canadiens no more about the constitution than we do and the canadiens have nothing but like state-run information they don't have choices so they'll be like listen let me tell you about the second amendment why it's important you know the articles of confederation didn't allow us for a standing army of like where are you from brampton you're not even you're not supposed to know any of that you know your prime minister needs a haircut like it always it's always an education so I get shot to be in like you don't even can't take a splinter like you were gonna punch out for a splinter man you know it means like my head is going from like super confident to but when he left and he turned and I saw his face I'm like he's scared and I like the fact that I hit him repeatedly he's wounded and i didn't you know i was like they're upgrading the dsc i mean it doesn't make any sense like what is going on and it went from being upgraded to just you know army times usa today all these media people telling the world that i'm going to i'm nominated for the medal of honor which is not something the army puts out no one puts that out you can't say you're nominated for anything it's not you know you're either approved or you either get it or you don't there's no like you didn't get the medal of honor give them the dsc it's the medal of honor nothing right you can take a silver star and upgrade it you can take a dsc and upgrade it but you know it doesn't give you a pass and and there's always gonna be you know there's it's it's it's crazy how uh we think that something that we get is you know somehow gonna make you coast through like i think there's a mindset that you don't need to do anything anymore get a dui tomorrow and find out the first thing they say won't be you know a random guy in buffalo with a radio show it's gonna be uh you know du i wanted to be a dad i wanted to coach soccer and i wanted to just see my kids and this is what we fought for so i just became a normal you know a guy i worked at a milk plant i was doing you know advocacy work for like the power grid you know like nothing crazy like you can't be against protecting the power grid you know what i mean and I I was so freaked out by the way an eyeball you know ruptures that it it just unnerved me the whole thing was just so it seemed like I was cheating you know what I mean like I was doing something that was not what we're supposed to do I never had an experience with with anything like that before I've never done anything like that in my life training no one's ever given us a power pointer class on that and and I had my helmet you know so i'm like thinking about it like how that looked and how that felt or whatever and like i kind of imagine like trying to choke someone and you know like you ever like maybe if you have the gi on but but those those were the viral jaco videos are not what you expect them to be they're not like the there's not it's not controversy it's just something that happened to you that people make viral because i can't believe it's like as if you had covid it was a declaration like you wanted to talk about your vaccine status there was a time when that question was asked some people didn't want to talk about it some people did some people said it's none of your business but the assumption that you had covid it meant something about vaccine status we now know it's ridiculous it's ridiculous that yankees air and judge he got covid everyone's like i can't believe you didn't get vaccinated i still do that by the way when i hear that someone gets covid i mean like you know you bring you bring your lunch to work you don't make lunch at work you know because you don't get in the kitchen and start constructing a meal like what the hell's wrong with you you know it's like i have one the pet peeve that drives me nuts is the wet hair hair what's the wet hair anyone that shows up with wet hair like is it raining out no death nothing makes any sense because you're that close to the finish line and it takes a lot to just kind of you know maybe i'm going a little bit too crazy you know what you don't want is you don't want you know that that guy who's getting out of the army he's got a month left in a combat zone and this is Jerry Rice's last football game and he wants one more touchdown before he hangs it up i don't want a guy who wants one more fight you know before he hangs it up you know so that which is crazy and mcmajor mcmajor mcclung was the pao who lost her life in the for the marines and i thought i got approved because i'm like the only guy that wants to be there and at the end of that tour at the end of that little time she said will you sign my time magazine and i was like no way like she's like yeah come on what do you think we're stupid like and i want to be like a normal guy but every time something happens with the war my local newspaper my local whatever is like this guy's getting the medal of honor and then people want to write books and the books they're writing are not the stories that happened they're like you know then you know he's killed eight people single-handedly uh you're not touching me not touching me right and these guys are like dude one of two things is happening either you're going to go to jail for 40 years or you're going to be the ambassador to france like we've never seen this before like there no one wants to acknowledge anything so i'm doing the radio show one day my contest line blows up like we give tickets to manheim steam roller and it's some someone from army personnel that's like you must pick up the phone or we'll come to your house the moral of story is uh when when i got out the award i didn't know what was happening with it and it everyone kind of turned the media at least people were like this isn't real this you're bullshitting this story is not true you know gerber would have given you a knife by now you know like this there's something would have happened like this this doesn't make any sense and yet everyone said there was a tape there's a tape out there and i didn't have a relationship with michael i think we're all raised differently in the in the military our leaders gave us tough love but now that we're out we're still ambassadors and it's very very important that people start to see veterans you know we're not some infomercial for sally struthers for 99 cents a month private snuff he can get a cup of coffee you know what i mean like we got uh you know like wounded dogs and cages and building houses i love those institutions but we're gonna run out of houses to build we're gonna run out of wounded men and women who gave us everything for our country god bless their sacrifice god bless their service and they know that when we were gone we were replaced by units that didn't have the same logo on their arms the insignia and what that meant the the red one and uh that we were in fallujah and that bought us a tremendous amount of street credit with the with the bad guys you know it's um we were super cocky we were super confident uh and we weren't you know the mistakes that we made the zigen and zagan and the old days was long gone the chances we were taking you know they always talk about how when you know john the john bas alone story of you know you get a guy that does crazy things at guata canal and as I'm dragging that outside open air I just hear like uh like someone like took off like a scuttle of feet and like the the most grotesque Joe Thysman snap um I've ever witnessed I played sports I've seen guys you know break legs and compound fractures Achilles injuries and we were all like outside of the house that blast was worse than anything that happened inside the house I mean it just voided all of our I mean just like we just like uncontrollable vomiting like so you were just outside the house when the 2000 the Bradley's so the Bradley's all pulled up on a line and the guys got inside the Bradley's and and zipped up and Fitz had grabbed me as I was making sure all the guys were in the brass he just grabbed me threw me a hole and honestly we got the best end of it because the guys that were in the brads got just completely concussed from that boxed in area and all that munition and I had soreness like on the back of my hamstring and my quads and my glute now it was just like in my head what happened and the and the real the realization that I did nothing to the enemy at least if I got two if I got one let's get the bomb and and the problem with Fallujah is that the bombs became like a butcher shop you know you got a big set play you got like three fixed wing I thought I had him in a good grip where I could at least and I thought the fight was out of him and he just starts biting me and then as I move up my body the hand that I was not holding I just I just heard a loud crack of what turned out to be a Soviet 45 I don't even know where he had it or where it came from but I just fired directly in the wrong he didn't thank God he didn't know where my head was but it was close enough to my head that it went from not being able to hear cloudy to like ringing not being able to hear you know which is it's like a tinnitus versus I just can't hear you know They become your mascot they become your empathy they're more than leaders they're the identity of who you are they're your validators every single day it's not a good day unless he says it's a good day you're not you know ready until he tells you you're ready and when that's gone it is a father figure it's it was devastating it was devastating and now you're not even in the fight yet like it'd be like you're going to the Normandy beach and the guy gets hit in the Higgins boat and now your the ramps are dropping and everyone's like what just and you're like forget it forget it everything's okay i mean i was trying to i didn't want to drink their water because then i it was weird because like they don't want they don't want you there like no one cares about you you can be missing for days and they're like when i don't know okay move on and and so they were like i'm gonna buy you a drink that was a excuse that got used by people when it came to training martial arts and jujitsu in the seal teams it was like well you know jujitsu you just wear a gi you don't wear all this gear or jujitsu you just wear a rash guard so it's unrealistic and you're not going to be able to fight when you have gear on and which is they would say the same thing about you or i would make comparison to parachuting because when you parachute with military equipment it's this big parachute and you've got you could potentially have a weapon with you potentially have a rucksack with you and you could have protect potentially have your web gear with you and you have all these things on so it's a lot different than me running down to sanny acedral or wherever and doing a civilian jump where i'm just like literally wearing a pair of short sneakers and i jump out a little back a little little uh parachute on my back and jump out throw out you know it's just real easy and slick and cool what year did you approximately say hey you know what it's been four years this shit ain't happened i got my silver star with my name missed out there was a guy all the metal living in recipients were afghanistan and the obama administration was very clear that iraq was the bad war afghanistan was a good war we don't talk about iraq the caliphates moving throughout the country no one wants to revisit iraq we're making iraq movies that we avoided because it was too close to reality now you know superman's making the movies and you know ramadi like all these things were happening that the culture was just like no more iraq hey she's like on social media like messaging I'm sending you know like messages get out of there we like Afghanistan was falling I was trying to pass messages like you need to get out of there now and this was like 2010 or something where you like i'd say 2010 that it was like okay fine and by the way i saw what happened to marcus i saw what was happening to all these other guys i mean they savaged dakota mayer for there's absolutely nothing no one can rationalize why that guy goes from american hero on a pedestal you know you you take wil swenson and dakota mayer each branch of service you get more for the exact same thing you don't think that's weird for those two guys you you don't think you're creating uh why are you doing that you can't say that wil swenson did something incredible that day dakota mayer did something incredible that day i never was in and uh then you got dakota and everything he went through and kyle and you know all these guys will swenson and you know just it just seemed like half of the population was like at a boy here's a free ticket to disneyland and the rest of them were like i'm gonna hunt you down and make sure you can never work a job again it's such a schizophrenic world man and so 2018 i'm minding my own business i i can't help you anymore it's time to move on and then all of a sudden i get these phone calls from guys i haven't talked to in forever guys the pentagon people i met you know in washington or overseas and they're like do you hear what's happening which is like the worst way to start a conversation did you hear what they're doing to you they knew a lot of information they had a lot of stuff and your your initial thought was they're investigating you from they were investigating they're asking questions well i'm not i don't even know who you are you're calling me on the phone you're asking me did you think the medal of honor just was never gonna happen at some point did you figure and and the other thing that that was so strange is that like you don't know where your guys are and so you're constantly you know thinking that you're going to get into a spot and these guys are going to frag out or just start juicing because you know you trained them to do you trained them to err on the side of area fire at all times they're going to go through a spendex in here with 240s and m249 saws and 40 millimeters and I don't want to be on the receiving end of that hey you should make this you should make that i'm like oh that sounds like a good idea i didn't really think of that i think if you go into social media with like a a positive mindset as cheesy as that sound of like okay there's gonna be some good stuff in here you're gonna find it if you go in there worried about a bunch of negativity which there's definitely gonna be uh it'll drive you crazy but without the ps14 it's crap and these things are just on and off they're just going in it never happened before I had great night I was like proud of the way I took care of my night the guys would break their night vision be like you dear responsible horrible human being you know what a marine would do to have that you get a seven bravo for the rest of your life you don't deserve the ps14 that was such a cool thing to have the ps14s and the squalid and we took great care of them and I never had an issue and all of a sudden like you need it you need to make that flight and it's delayed and you're screwed and my night vision start coming on and off and i honestly i don't even give a damn about i mean you're you're just a a vacuous non-entity at the end of the day if you're not going to put the fire out if you're not going to help tell everyone there's a fire and all you want to do is comment on why the fire got put out then you're just a jackoff like there's no there's no there's nothing in the chain that says i need more of that so stop acting like you're on an equal platform with a disabled veteran you know let's give a service dog to everyone if you need a dog get a dog i'm not offended you have a dog i don't think you need a potbelly pig i think you're being obnoxious with a peacock i think when you brought a bull with fairy shrimp in it you're just being an ass i always wanted to be on the ground and more specifically i wanted to be some kind of a commando of some kind i wanted to like put cammy pain on and sneak over beaches and kill people that's what i wanted to do that's the only that's the first job i remember wanting like when i've realized i'm gonna grow up and i had to do something i wanted to do that something where i put uh uh cammy cork on my face you know because we used to burn the cork and put the black on our faces when we were little kids i wanted to do that over the water into enemy territory and kill bad guys that's the only thing i remember wanting to do so that's why if i want to join the steel teams it would have been the marine corps because the marine corps was in the water and i knew that much even as a young kid but pilot was never was never was never into it never even thought about it for a minute so i i always wondered that because it what i think about like the um even when i watch avatar i'm rooting for the marines and that i know they're the bad guys but that i don't like the blue people are the ones that like i like the and you just got to marry another guy and someone told me he was like Bellevue that was 12 years ago man 12 years ago let this woman move on with her life you're holding on you have no idea what she's been through you have no idea who this guy is you can't think like that this is these families have gone through so much and we promised that we would be there have we been there what kind of lives have we lived we said we were gonna live for them and be twice as good because they're not here we have to do more with our lives how many have done that instead we're talking about suicide and addiction and and how people have quit there's no way you're thinking about your buddy that died in the war if you're thinking about you know killing yourself getting high or or giving up you are betraying all of that we we've been far too soft with this generation of saying oh it's acceptable that's a choice you're making a choice it's a valid choice it's bullshit it's not a valid choice you you made a promise and it and you know that's exactly what what he said too you know and look you got you got all your friends you got a machine gun all your friends got machine guns you got a pistol all your friends got pistols you got a knife all your friends got knives you'd think there's a pretty slim chance you're gonna have to actually kill someone with your hands or with your helmet or with your knife it's pretty small chance but there you go there you go so keep training everybody keep training awesome honor to have him on with that speaking of training when you train you're gonna need to feel your system it's true it's true jockel so the drinks the energy drinks which have no sugar in them the energy drinks which have no chemical preservatives in them this is what everyone else is feeding you the stuff that has sugar in it the stuff that has chemical preservatives in it the stuff that has chemical flavoring in it we don't have any of that this stuff is literally good for you you can get it get milk get the ready to drink milk by the way we had a little uh jockel fuel board meeting today we started discussing how much milk ready to drink we should make and i'm listening and there's comments being made you know it's going to be this investment it's going to do this thing we got to do with this far in advance important information like what how much should we boom we're going back and forth and finally i said hey make as much milk as you can make as much as you can we're like we have it at the gym here but we we got to honor those promises we made each other when when we thought the world was going to end in 24 hours at this point I'm gonna fast forward a little bit it's basically go time and there's a I kind of have to read this part because we get a new character gets introduced into the scenario here you say this throughout alpha company digital cameras appear and soon the men are posing for one another nearby are embedded reporters take all take all this in they cluster together like new kids in second grade watching the scene as awkward outsiders these photos are crucially important a form of insurance against our own mortality a few months back we lost a man and realized to our unending dismay that no one had a single photo of him to display at his memorial service it was disgraceful surely this is in the back of everyone's mind now this time we will have a record of every soul who goes through the breach Michael Ware breaks ranks from the cluster of journalists with Yuri in tow they come over to third platoon and offer to take our picture the platoon lines up and they go to work the other embeds see this and promptly stream to their assigned units taking cameras and snapping pictures of them as they click away they are no longer awkward outsiders now they're now they found a way to help us they circulate among the soldiers and start to fit in they've shown us they're human and the company appreciates that after Michael and Yuri finest finally finish up I light a smoke and stretch out on the ground next to the track it's almost 0900 the morning is crisp cold and punctuated by distant artillery barrages every few minutes and Apache funders overhead fast moving fighter jets crisscross above them in the sky this is where I belong it's the first time in my life that I've found my place it's a reassuring thought that eases some of the butterflies fluttering around in my gut I wonder if it was like this for the soldiers of the Union Army during the Civil War tenting on the old campground and all quiet on the Potomac have been replaced by our percussion heavy metal modern riffs of mud vein and dope and you know we in the military we're super weird about you know we laugh at things that are you look at today and you're like you would never say these words or you never laugh at these jokes but expressing love in in my 20s was could not be done you couldn't go up to a guy in your 30s or your 20s in uniform and be like i love you you know don't ask don't tell just just love me write me a note or something and when you hit a certain age you realize i love you
