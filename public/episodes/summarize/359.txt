so I know it always concerned him because he just didn't want to lose a father it was the 28th of September and the first of the 506 had one last request Operation Kentucky Jumper the SEALs would be providing overwatch for Combat Outpost Eagle's Nest while the external wall of the Combat Outpost was being reinforced in addition the first of the 506 would be conducting a clearance in the same area which the SEALs would cover as well the insert would take place at night the two elements would leave cop eagles nest and set up mutually supporting rooftop overwatch positions in two prominent houses much like they had been doing for the entire deployment the men had conducted this type of operation many times and at this point it seemed like this one would be much the same so they push in they do this overwatch around 11 a.m the army moved out of the area having finished operations for the day the SEAL overwatch positions remained in place and would extract under the cover of darkness later that night other than the first of the 506 doing clearance ops and us being in the area providing overwatch it was kind of a somber day Doug said referring to how the day was going in comparison to other similar operations they had completed based on most of the previous operations the likelihood of the firefight was low of another firefight was low the temperature was reaching 115 degrees and they would stay there until late in the afternoon and only begin to cool when the sun dip below the horizon as the morning turned into day and then early afternoon Michael Doug and Mike S talked of heading home and what was next for each of them there was a sense of excitement we were proud of what we did we were proud of our relationships we had built with the army in the Marine Corps recalls Mike Surrelly the men talked of their families Doug would be headed back to Georgia to see his three sons Mike S was ready to get back to his two-year-old little girl Michael listened as the guy spoke of heading home he was ready as well sniper school heading into his next platoon snowboarding trips and driving up the coast to see his family in Garden Grove Doug recalls how cool and relaxed Michael was he just had a real calming sense to him you could tell instantly what a great person and warrior he was to this point it was the most one on one time Doug had spent with Michael as the day continued on the intense heat had begun to wear on the men the shade material help but not but the heat radiated from surfaces all around them not even the light breeze brought reprieve the air was stifling dry and filled with dust the lack of activity and the heat induced lethargy degrading the men's awareness boom an explosion rocked the rooftop Michael ran back over to the position between Mike S and Doug what was that RPG asked Doug sure seemed like it Mike S replied the anger on Michael's face was apparent as he searched for the insurgent responsible for the attack Mike S moved out of his loophole and called the other element we just took an RPG searching for the shooter now what have you guys got Doug rolled into the open spot as it had a better field of view than his loophole Michael sat on the chair between the two with his mark 48 resting on the wall of the rooftop Mike S continued updating the other element while Michael Doug and Benny scan the area they saw nothing no enemy movement suddenly an object just barely cleared the lip of the wall and hit Michael in the chest it bounced off and rolled to the ground directly in front of him Mike S looked over at what had just landed next to the group then up at Michael Michael stood so quickly and with such force that the chair he was sitting on sailed across the rooftop and impacted the opposite wall Michael looked at Mike S and yelled grenade and so uh what was good about the seals is she couldn't call them they wouldn't give her the time of day i would call them and tell them what i'd like to do and we had a lot of stories but a lot of the guys they didn't want to share those stories it was personal and so i respect that but some of the guys uh after a couple of calls uh they would open up uh to uh to rose and uh i felt like as they opened up they actually felt good about it and it kind of like let some let out a little bit of uh some of that pressure what happened over there and i was surprised how many said it was okay if they used uh you know their name Mike S watched in disbelief as Michael the only one of them who had an out to escape the blast instead lunged forward dropping directly onto the grenade Seth's element had heard and seen the two blasts from their overwatch position and were already moving when the call for help came in the men urgently picked up the pace when they heard the amount of enemy automatic weapon fire that their friends were receiving they broke out from the main house the main entrance and headed west initially it was all quiet at their position but within 15 seconds of hitting the street all hell broke loose enemy rounds snapped and skipped around them they moved from cover to cover returning fires they closed the distance to the other overwatch position they were only two blocks away but to the wounded seals it seemed like it took forever for the other element to arrive hold on Mikey hold on Mike S said as he and Doug continued to assess and aid Michael suddenly a seal from the other element burst onto the roof and headed over to Doug Mike S and Michael he was followed by Seth and the other seals one of the strongest seals grabbed Michael and hoisted him onto his back Seth grabbed Doug and the others took Mike S they could hear the 25 millimeter auto cannons of the Bradley fighting vehicles begin to fire effectively suppressing the enemy and providing cover for the seals to load their wounded Mike S directed the group as they moved down the stairs and into the alley to the waiting Bradley's Doug Mike S and Michael were loaded onto the into the back along with one of the seals from the other element he stayed to continue to aid Michael while the Bradley's extracted them and headed back to Camp Corregidor when the wounded seals arrived they saw the men from the first the 506 lined up waiting to support whatever they could another testament to the bond that the two units and shared Doug Mike S and Michael were loaded onto stretchers and brought into the aid station on the camp Doug and Mike S were given shots of morphine for the first time since the grenade explosion they finally had reprieve from the physical piercing pain the reprieve however was short lived the atmosphere in the room shifted the mood had darkened and the two men could feel it then they overheard the nurse say it Michael was gone and that sobering moment they became aware of what Michael had given them he had freely exchanged his life for theirs it was September 29th the feast day of st. Michael the art a arch angle the arch angel the protector and guide of warfighters since time immemorial and whom Michael had been named 25 years earlier it was a bad day for the family remember Jim called me to hear him crying dad is bad it's bad i said what's bad he says uh Michael Michael died from Monty please get ahold of Joe tried to call Joe and i finally got ahold of him he was uh playing football in north dakota and uh i couldn't even tell him finally got ahold of him i couldn't even tell him i couldn't even talk i said just call your brother oh he's he's he's a hundred percent uh he helped me uh i'm very good friends with him and he helped me with everything i ever need to help with and look i caused all kinds of trouble for that poor guy i was constantly constantly caused that he would bail me out of all kinds of things so thank you mr steve gilmore uh but he was able to connect captain smith with a bunch of different people captain smith sat down for hours with each group learned as much as he could in order to create something remarkable that would inspire his future crew members they would collectively come up with the the connected with it with uh uh something that connected the family with the navy as well as the ship's unique components and so this is for the motto of the ship became i will defend which carries a three-fold meaning every military member takes an oath to support and defend the constitution another prominent middle military ethos says i will defend the defenseless and the saint michael prayer calls upon the mighty angelic soldier to defend us in battle have you been in have you been in the ship i have when i talked to scott i was like uh we wanted something for the seals not to be forgotten and uh that's why if you walk in you'll see the pictures of those other seals and uh it was important to us that those seals aren't forgotten because sometimes congressional medal of honor people forget about these people well pain is the same and we wanted to remember them on that ship so he did a good job for us i would get uh phone messages and where uh Michael would call would miss the message just kicking back with with my bros uh send cigars critical information sends cigars exactly uh there's there's there's really good examples of this throughout the book another one immediately enemy fire began to hit the wall around the rooftop Michael reposition toward the contact and fire the enemy were using the cover of surrounding houses effectively and continued to harass the security position it was clear this was not like other attacks it was well coordinated the enemy was careful not to engage from the same spot for too long and continued to maneuver and flank the rounds from mikes 48 began to eat chunks out of the corners and ledges that the enemy were using his cover the short rooftop wall was beginning to degrade as well however and bullets were penetrating the plaster in some areas the men stayed low and continued to engage Michael was glad he had prepped his extra ammo ahead of time it looked as though he would be needing it soon Michael and the other seals on the rooftop were not the only ones taking fire the iraqi army scouts were trying to exit the house to maneuver on the insurgents but were pinned inside every time one of the scouts tried to exit the house a hail of bullets hit the area around the exit on the rooftop the situation was not improving and it looked like ammunition might soon become a problem not for Michael he continued to engage multiple enemy positions stopping only to reload and reposition Mikey how's your ammo yell and i guess i went a little quicker than i showed up you know wore some of the guys out uh and just to close this out um father halloweday stepped up to the podium let us pray heavenly father bless and approve this newly commissioned vessel the USS michael monsoor and its crew send your holy angels as custodians and guides may michael and the arch angel ever defend it in battle be its protector against all enemies and ravages of foul weather may this vessel and crew always know the friendship of the creatures of the deep the camaraderie of the winds and the enmity of the tides and may the USS michael monsoor ever know the unified patronage of the citizens of heaven the creatures of earth and every mission it undertakes to restore peace ensure freedom and enact justice for all i've met so many really wonderful people uh over this and uh father halloweday was uh was won uh he also did a mass and baptized uh joseph son on that ship i mean that thanks for uh uh for raising us on like mickey and for sharing them with us we won't forget it well we really appreciate the seal community and like i said we appreciated uh the way we were treated the respect from you and this family was important i just wanted to close that out because who knows when i'm gonna see you again and i really appreciate this moment so thanks jacko thank you and with that george monsoor has left the building and once again life is a gift and thanks for listening we appreciate it and if you want to support the podcast well first of all get the book like i said i read like little pieces of the book the book has a bunch more in it they did a great job writing it so order the book what is it is it christmas season I think that's important for people to read these type of books uh I can get a taste and these these stories as you said they're from uh the guys that were there these stories are real and uh I think it would give uh the rest of the country just kind of a fingernail sketch of what these guys go through and also if you have you know uh teenage children they can see that guys like Michael they're just like them they they have problems when they're kids i mean give it to give it to everybody that you know give it to like you mentioned teenagers for sure because i think they can understand and it even you know it's not like uh it's not like this pro thing where they're gonna kids or parents are scared their kids are going to run out and join the military it's the journey that he took and what he uh overcame and these kids who are feeling you know insecure and you got and again you interviewed a bunch of people for this the deafening noise the machine gun fire suddenly erupted from an enemy insurgent position to the right Michael dropped into his field of fire identifying the enemy position immediately sent back a long burst with his mark 48 contact right multiple seals yelled as they sent round after round toward the enemy Mike sprinted to the closest position to cover which was a courtyard wall of a nearby house and picked up fire the other seals and the Iraqi army scouts moved into courtyard and began returning fire as well changing yelled Mike as he stripped out an empty ammo box and loaded a full one just as he closed the feed tray cover five enemy fighters moved to flank Michael and his team they are flanking to the west Mike yelled as he fired at the maneuvering insurgents he caught them halfway through their movement and had them pinned behind a small vehicle hold them there Mike JP yelled Mike could overhear the marine angler the marine air naval gunfire liaison company Anglico guys on the radio setting up for a strike on the enemy fighters he had pinned down cast in 30 seconds called out the controller letting the guys know the jets were 30 seconds out from dropping from Michael to seem like an eternity he had the best vantage point to keep the enemy where they were as the other seals and scouts were still engaging the original enemy position he conserved his ammo knowing a reload may give the insurgents just enough time to maneuver away from their current position which could cause the close air support strike to have to abort and start over he continued to send five to eight round bursts into the vehicle yeah we'll see heard about people are freaking out about all kinds of things the thing is all this social media facebook the gram twitter you just got to watch out because the algorithm will grab you that's what's going to happen and uh once again thanks to thanks to george monstor for coming on board and and really um the entire monstor family who have been blessed to have gotten to know know over the past 15 years um just been amazing an honor to know them and it's an honor to be here and and share the story of mikey uh absolute hero an example for all of us so thank you to the entire monstor family and thanks to all the people from the military in general the army navy air force marines as you could probably tell we had an incredible relationship with all of them and we thank you for supporting us on the battlefield and in the past and now those that are still active duty out there protecting us today thank you and we also want to thank our police law enforcement firefighters paramedics emt's dispatchers correctional officers border patrol secret service all first responders out there you protect us here at home and we passed on all of them and then just uh when one of the sailors did a book on michael and gave it to a submissive at the cemetery and that's when i started thinking my grandchildren should have a book because they should see what it's like um you know they got to understand that michael uncle michael went through some of the same things they went through you know it just doesn't happen you've got to have you know you've got to be able to figure things out you have to be strong enough because when you're a kid you're bullied or you're you know you're not sure of yourself the world is is really scary for him Got another guy here Michael and Z went through all of Bud's together they grab they graduated from Bud's basic airborne seal qualification training now assigned to seal team three Z to Echo platoon and Mike to Delta platoon the weeks were busy training and the weekends were spent riding their bikes and that's motorcycles by the way chasing girls hanging out with the guys after a day of riding they'd often come back to connect and unwind at bar Dynamite a small bar in Mission Bay where they'd grab drinks with friends including Gabe and other freshly minted and another freshly minted seal Tommy D. Mike was Mike was living life to the fullest he was renting this house in Mission Bay while the new guys like myself lived in one small bedroom small one bedroom apartment said Z laughing a motorcycle and a stellar pal pad were not the only things Michael set his sights on he was eyeing his next car and he knew exactly what he wanted just received a contract bonus that he used to buy a silver 2004 Corvette Z zero six Michael could never be a financial advisor this is like the classic thing I tell guys not to do when they get their bonus I should go hey listen don't go buy a Corvette don't go buy a Ford 350 super duty Harley Davidson don't don't do that it's hard to talk about I know Yeah, he thought it was actually important, especially if people are getting stressed out, like in Buds, he can see it on their faces and he thought, you know, he's seeing these guys are going on tilt, you know, and, you know, our family does that, you know, they'll equip this and that, you know, and he's always done that when things get real serious and it kind of brings people down. and I go what do you mean what's wrong with his attitude and he goes every time I tell him something one of the instructors tell him so all he does look out up at us and say Roger that that's all he has and I go hey bro I told him that's all he's supposed to say and he's just following that to a T that's what he's doing and when he would say that the guys that he's with are like kind of smirking like no one knew if he was a smart ass or he's just following your orders that's a I'll tell you so here's another similar story we're you were in the Humvees and this we're going through the block of training with Humvees and the the gunners call out you know like clear right like you come up to an intersection and the gunners which is Mikey call out clear right or clear left i mean they do an awesome thing and and it's written about in the book as well as you know when you pull into san diego harbour off to your left hand side is rosecrance where mickey's buried and you know actually marx buried there and sestones buried there but when you pull in they they man the rails and they give the the ship salute you know to mickey which is just awesome so you get the legacy carrying on with the crew with the ship in this book um and in the the young you know the young seals today they're this is what they're raised on they're raised on this is what uh this is this is the ideal seal this is a guy that works hard that's never going to give up and that's going to take care of his brothers and that's that's mickey but he was a badass so to connect that to this guy who you know had asthma and got bullied and like like while i knew mike mike was not getting bullied by anybody you know what i'm saying so he had overcome all that and and and like you said um it risen up and at the same time that he had that quality like there's literally no one else that you would rather have to watch your back oh a little while ago was that Mikey was always telling you about who's married and checking in on who has kids and that was a big concern is was he knew who had kids who was married and he he would tell me I worry about these guys he goes I don't want to be the guy that lost one of these uh one of these guys who has children because he believed fathers mothers is you know a two-person deal and uh he's always loved kids and he just would be so bothered knowing that on his watch somebody lost the father and he would talk about I mean I mean people really want to find out who's got kids in there and they somehow got wood this guy captain smith is a great guy captain scott smith who like took this with the utmost seriousness of course because he's the first commanding officer of this ship and he got they got wood from the uss constitution like crazy how do you do that uh you have this here each naval warship has its own crest and motto and captain smith who's the first commanding officer took meticulous efforts to honor the ship's namesake with each one for the crest he was given parameters of simply using a shield the rest was up to him he knew exactly what to do in order to make sure the ship honored its names it's the ship and namesake perfectly there were a handful of people family teammates and friends he would need to talk to was introduced to steve gilmore but uh i was really taken back by you know these guys coming over and checking on the family and it was a good thing at what point did you hear about the ship i was about i remember uh dr o winter talked about uh a ship and see we don't know anything about the navy uh we're not into the ceremony stuff but that was a you know that attitude that Roger that attitude man that's um that that was it you know that was he was gonna he was gonna get it done one of the first blocks of training work up was land war for out at Nile in California by the Salton Sea with a hundred and seven degree summer average it's a scorching place to train and sure enough we were out there in the summertime this combined with a schedule rocky mounted terrain scarred with washes makes the literal and figurative crucible of the work up here's where the platoon will work on the tactics techniques and procedures of fighting in open terrain as well as demolitions rockets and mortars and all the different small arms weapons systems of the sea arsenal a platoon is normally made up of 16 to 20 operators each having a specific role to include snipers preachers communicators and automatic weapons gunners to name a few although specialized within the platoon each man is still responsible to be proficient at the other jobs Michael and the other new guys could not wait to jump right in and get started Michael caught on very quickly especially with his automatic weapon the mark 48 each of the new guys were being watched closely by the older men in the platoon his LPO Doug Wallace remembers how that even though Michael is quickly picking up on the tactics and performing all tasks efficiently and without complaint it was always with humility and a willingness to learn more misery loves company and Nile and is a block where there's many reasons to complain of our intense conditions Mike never did once not one time it showed great character and understanding on his part especially for a new guy Doug said and then there's another section here the battalion was huge and led by lieutenant colonel Ron Clark his men were professional talented and worked incredibly well with the seals Michael's troop commander lieutenant commander jockel will he could instructed his men to use army to use the army's uniform a tricolor gray digital pattern called army combat uniform or acu's it was very different from the tricolor desert naval special warfare uniform the men wore it and even shaved their heads to match their army brethren this was not only this not only increased the cohesion of the two units but also had a very practical purpose by blending in with the army unit the seals did not stand out as special forces the enemy had begun to target soldiers that looked or dressed differently than the average so that's why when people see pictures of that element they're wearing they're wearing army uniforms um that's what it is they wanted to blend in and wanted to not stand out and wanted to form a relationship with the army you know there's just just you know sometimes in special operations you know you can wear all this Gucci gear yeah the so my wife is at home she got three kids they're like how old were they they were like maybe seven five and three or something like this they're maybe you know six four and two or something like this I'm like absolutely tell the army guys were you you good with us putting snipers Colonel Colonel Clarks like absolutely they start killing guys almost immediately enemy rocket teams mortar teams IED in places and at the same time where we're out at Camp Corregador for a couple days the living conditions are terrible in the life it was like dirt floors there's mosquitoes you know they're getting murdered indirect fire on a regular basis just just it was just freaking horrible so uh i i think it's uh it's a book that uh is worth reading no it's uh it's a hundred percent worth reading and that's a way for mickey's legacy to you know to carry on you carry on the ship and it's great when you meet the ship and the ship's crew they're they all know the story they're all fired up and I you know it was just crazy guys would risk their lives go out and get those packages you know hey women toiletries just what we need uh he says I'm gonna go head to bed now I want to say hello to you guys Mike's voice began to drift off the day his operation had begun to hit him like a wall his body was now just registering need for sleep of course take care of yourself we're all
